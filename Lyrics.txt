Any rapper saying those kind of rhymes
In this day and age in this period of time
Tryna battle Eminem is worse than
David Starr tryna battle Proof, Eye-Ku, BFlat and Bizarre
(unintelligible)
That's why you beg to differ me, you ain't got no style
Plus you lack delivery, not to brag
I don't need to boast
Look, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost
(unintelligible)
You couldn't slip up in the zone, if I put banana peels
Around this fucking microphone
So get a bulldozer, start from bottom to top
And tear this building down
'cause that's the only way you 'recking shop



[Verse 1]
Everybody, duck down, all you hear is the sound
Of Slim Shady spittin' rounds at the Lyricist Lounge
What year is this now? I don't know, I forgot
All I know is that I'd die for pot, make the cypher hot
Smoke weed and fuck up my life a lot
Give me the money now, bitch
Did you want to see your wife or not?
'Fore I stab her wit' this knife I got
I got a sci-fi plot like a science fiction flick that I'm a hit you wit'
I got the Outsidaz up in this bitch
Peace to Thirstin' Howl, A.L. and Wordsworth
My mother smoked crack, I had a premature birth
I'm just a nerd cursed wit' badly disturbed nerves
Who wanna step to this and get served first?
Ninety-nine percent of aliens prefer Earth
So I'm here to rule the planet, startin' wit' your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a word search
Wit' smeared letters, runnin' together in blurred spurts
Rappers can't fuck wit' me, it hurts worth
When they get abolished, polyps'll murk worse
Wrote a secret message inside of a word search
Wit' smeared letters, runnin' together in blurred spurts
Rappers can't fuck wit' me, hollerin', 'Nurse, nurse'
You said this shot would numb it, bitch, it just hurts worse
Rappers can't fuck wit' the way that I spit it, lyrical lit it
Now you did it when I committed, get his rhymes out here
Off the top of the dome wit' a popular poem
Fuck a team, I can stop you alone
Rappers don't understand it



[RAP BATTLE 1]
I'ma tell you this for your own benefit
Your shit was dope as hell, 'specially when you wrote ninety-percent of it
What you need to do is practice on your freestyles
'Fore you come up missin', like Snoop Dogg's police files
This type of literature that I'm spittin' be hittin'
You gonna swear to God this shit was written
But it wasn't, I'll kill a dozen rappers when I'm buzzin'
Guzzlin', beat your ass like a jealous husband
Now, you boys are about to suffer and see north
When you go in a coma longer than Vladimir Konstantinov
Cut the damn machine off
Get a clean cloth, and wipe this bloody video screen off

[RAP BATTLE 2]
I'm movin' in for the kill, plus I got the trap set
I can tell you're wack as fuck, and I ain't even hear you rap yet
Look at you thinkin', "I'm about to whip his ass
Cause I'ma do some written shit, plus I get to go last."
Well, guess what? Even if I go first, it's no worse
My shit's still gon' demolish yo' verse
I'm 'bout to slice you like a Ginsu
And anything you say can and will be used against you
In a court of law, I'm short and raw
Take your fuckin' shit and cut it off
Yo, you wanna be a dope emcee?
Look, don't get mad and start takin' your period out on me

[RAP BATTLE 3]
You wanna represent on the microphone, but you rap sleazily
I ain't about to battle this fake ass Eazy-E
There ain't no way I'ma do this bullshit
I don't give a fuck, I'm loaded up with a full clip
Time of the month? You couldn't get the tape of the day
Take him away, I rip him like a paper mache
I heard you rap before, you ain't about shit
This whole battle was mismatched, like your outfit
Try to battle me and get your mouth split
You sold out, like Ticketmaster Outlet
Ha ha, I bust and I crush
I don't give a fuck, ain't no way that you can fuck with us
I'm givin' back with pimp shit
I laminate that ass in a badge and wear it at the Rap Olympics

[RAP BATTLE 4]
Blah-badee-blah-da-blah-blahstop babblin'!
You so fuckin' wack I'ma walk away while you battlin'
Fuck that, I'm on a brand new solo mission
To make sure that Wendy Day kicks your ass out of the rap coalition
I throw a switch at an execution
With an overdose of devotion
Don't talk back, I'm the dope, bitch
So who you sound like on the mic?
There was only one 2Pac, your thug style is just one big sike
Take a big hike, bitch, you can't catch me
Your best rhymes still ain't shit, like a patsy
What the fuck you gonna do?
I'll battle anybody in your crew
And I don't give a fuck, I slaughter boys
Especially wack-ass emcees that will wear a fake-ass corduroy

[RAP BATTLE 5]
I'm 'bout to make this mic short circuit
This beat is wack as fuckthis shit fits you perfect!
I got so many ways to diss you that I'm playful with you
I'll let a razor slit you, 'til they have to staple-stitch you
And everybody in this fuckin' place'll miss you
If you try to turn my facial tissue to a racial issue
Nobody's hearin' you, you're a wack liar
Damn! All your white jokes just backfired
Cause, bitch, you barkin' up the wrong tree
Now go tell all your boys that you was beat by a honkey
I don't give a fuck, I'll kill ya
Bitch, you better recognize me, like I look familiar
Anything you say, I'ma kill ya
Grill ya, when I fuckin' drill ya
I'm Marsh, but you're the one that's mellow



[Intro]
Hi kids, do you like Kim's bullshit? (No!)
Wanna see me stick her fucking eyeballs right in to my anus?

[Verse 1]
I got a fucking time traveling machine to go back all to this
And see all the piss that she gave me, bitch
She made me fall on my ass
The walls are caving in and I gotta go ham on this bitch
Like, woah, so we never fell in love so I didn't have to
Go through that shit no more
It's like a nugget, I'm hugging these sluts
That are bothering this fucking chick when I murder
And spit on the beat like the drugs I was taking
Just a bit of it
And stop slurping the blood off her face, or I'll murder you too with a bag full of mace and if Kim comes to my house and says "Wanna get back together?"
And I say "No, get out before I [slit your throat] and splatter the blood on this sweater!"
Blue eyes, red eyes, green eyes, bloody eyes
Hi Mom, you're back again, rock climbing my dick to see how famous my fucking life is?

[Chorus]
1980, still feeling shady, 1983, bitch never leave me
1987, met this bitch in heaven, 1999, my life was very deprived
I said hey, do you want me? I'm still feeling kinda shady
1999, we got 3 babies, 1999, will you ever leave me?
Because back then, I was kind of shady
1980, still feeling shady, 1983, bitch never leave me
1987, met this bitch in heaven, 1999, my life was very deprived
I said hey, do you want me? I'm still feeling kinda shady
1999, we got 3 babies, 1999, will you ever leave me?
Because back then, I was kind of shady

[Verse 2]
Ring around the rosie, pocket full of posie
Kim, Kim, be shady like me, I'm trying for the 4th
Stop being a bitch, please, walking across the highway
Playing Chicken, while brains splatter all over the road like
"ricken, ricken", my phone's dead, now how can I call the bitch?
I'll use the payphone, this bitch is calling my dead phone, she won't leave me alone
Spent 75 cents on her, and she didn't answer
Now I'll come to her house and [slaughter her ancesters]
Boo! I'm a ghost, you happy to see me? I'm taking your soul
Well shit, you don't believe me? Boom, I did it, do you believe me now? Shit whatever, I'm the king so hand me the crown

[Chorus]
1980, still feeling shady, 1983, bitch never leave me
1987, met this bitch in heaven, 1999, my life was very deprived
I said hey, do you want me? I'm still feeling kinda shady
1999, we got 3 babies, 1999, will you ever leave me?
Because back then, I was kind of shady
1980, still feeling shady, 1983, bitch never leave me
1987, met this bitch in heaven, 1999, my life was very deprived
I said hey, do you want me? I'm still feeling kinda shady
1999, we got 3 babies, 1999, will you ever leave me?
Because back then, I was kind of shady

[Outro]
1999, the slut's pussy is so dry, I said 1999, the slut's pussy is so dry, no other faggot can control my life



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Tim Westwood, Marley Marl and Slim Shady and MC Proof
Proof on my side, my sidekick
Y'all can suck my wide -ick
Said the "ick" without the D in front of it
None of you rappers want none of it
Ill put you on punishment like Big Pun
Wanna suck my "ick-ick"? Here's a big one
I'll do it with the fluid that Im spillin'
I'm illin', plus I'm chillin', I'm not a villain
Forget the controversy surroundin' me
And all these fake-ass press people surroundin me, houndin me
But I don't give a damn cause I smoked a pound of weed
Y'all don't want none of me
So get from in front of me like Chuck D
All the these bitches wanna walk up and fuck me
Whoops! Did I say that or did I think it?
I don't know but my brain starts shrinkin
My spine starts shrivelin', givin' 'em adrenaline
When I'm killin' 'em and no DNR for Benylin
And this is right off the top
Take a bottle of pop and bit off the top
Tim, I said that last time when I was on your show
But it really doesn't matter 'cause I kick this slowest flow
With a flow that's slow, really doesn't matter
Said it backwards, but all you fake-ass rappers are actors
And I'ma bring it to ya
You got a life and you got a song
But don't know how to sing it, do ya?
No you don't, so I'ma kill it
I'ma cook a cracked egg in a skillet and eat it
And smoke it and whatever, take my dick and poke it
Blastin' off right now!

[Interlude: Marley Marl]
Aight! Ha-ha-ha
No doubt
No doubt, baby

[Verse 2: Proof & Eminem]
Proof!
MC Proof, here on the mic raise the roof
Kill 'em like 180-Proof
D12, D12, D12 (D12)
Too many white and black people I been gnarly
Rockin' with Tim Westwood and Mr. Marley
It's time for us to do y'all, who y'all?
We break balls like cue balls, while y'all switch up like RuPaul
It's true y'all don't wanna mess around with us
A lotta people I been with is dangerous
Why's this beat so fast?
I know

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Wow, this beats are a little bit too fast for my headache
But I don't give a damn, someone call a paramedic
'Cause I'm pathetic, I need a little bit of Excedrin to make my damn head spin
I'll do a head spin, a windmill and then chill, and then kill (Westwood!)
Whatever, I'm clever with these beat that I kick over these techniques
Like technique 12 inches, I get blunted
And any rapper that wants it, don't want it
They kick in front it, right to their face
I give, I'ma smackin' it and I don't give a damn
'Cause I got Proof backin' it
Y'all don't wanna step to me
You put your life in jeopardy
Y'all better choose your mother weaponry
Ayo Proof, get on the mic
Show these mother what it's like

[Verse 4: Eminem & Proof]
All you motherf goin' get f up now
Aw man
No cussin', no potions, slow motion, jack off with no lotion
I'm slower than the flow in the ocean
I can cause an explosion, to knock water out of an ocean
When I'm coastin', jumpin' the rowboat and start flowin' in it
I brought the microphone, my -ick I'm totin' it
Like a Glock that cock
I rock the microphone and rock the spot
And rappers jock a lot, Proof come in whether you're wack or not (These voices)
Or dope or not (These voices)
(I hear them, I hear them voices)
(These voices I hear them)
(And when they talk I'll follow)
(I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow all these voices)
(These voices I hear them)
(And when they talk I'll follow)
(I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow)

[Interlude: Marley Marl & Eminem]
Yo, yo, yo, I'ma give you this hot beat
Marley Marl style
Go ahead, Proof
Slim Shady, Marley Marl joint exclusive freestyle

[Verse 5: Proof & Emimen]
Yo, exclusive
For all our supporters
Roll your tape recorders
This is goin' overseas to many different borders (Westwood!)
Here it is, Paul Bunyan, he speaks Yiddish
Niggas and Slim Shady run for the English to the British
Time for them to get down, stood up, listen to us
We can rock the microphone and never got to cuss
Us, trust, nuts, of course we dangerous
[?] derange the bus is danger
Well I flip it and I kick and I rip it and I flip
I figgity back the microphone and figgity-figgity-wheepsy
Yo, check it out, yo, my hair ain't nappy
But, yo, can this beat please get a little more happy?
I diggity what for biggity what
I biggity bust a savage
I biggity down, flip them down, flip them like a [?]

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, hold on, hold on, hold on (Holdin' on)
This beat a little bit too happy for my stinkin' self
Nah, this is nice, this is nice
This is some explicit shit that y'all can't get with
Get my wrists slit, I ain't a nit wit
But I'll smoke weed and pass out like a sampling snippet
Y'all don't wanna hear me rip it
Y'all don't wanna hear me flip it
I biggity-biggity-biggity-whoopsie
Like Das EFX, you get a broken neck
My textbook, take a next look
Y'all don't wanna understand the way that I just come off at the top
And I can always drop everything that I stop
Or everything that I keep goin' and keep flowin'
Like the Energizer bunny, that's why it's funny
When rappers try to step to me and try to step to me
And battle me for money, 'cause you're a dummy
'Cause anything that you could say I could use against you (Westwood!)
And I can slice your ass like a chem suit
Let me continue, put the shit on the menu
Rappers don't wanna step to me
Because [?]
Then I continue to bust, never ever trust
Any MC 'cause I turn 'em all to friggin' dust

[Verse 7: Proof]
Yeah, we turn 'em to dust
Ayo, Dirty Dozen gon' battle with anything
You better off hop in a plane with JFK
Display lyrical styles, we get it dirty
It's Dirty Dozen, D12 [?]
No need to write this, 'cause when we write this
Y'all hear Shady, Proof, Bizarre and [?]
It's time to hype this, get it with this
It's Tim Westwood, get on your best foot
Your chest could take a slug from us
Do drug with us, you bug with us? Nah
Don't even try that, you hear this stuff?
Well, next time, the LP buy that
No time to hide that
Ayo, the hi-hat, go buy that
You die flat for talkin' that
You get bust up, who's that?
Paul Rosenberg, yo, frozen turds
Get stepped over, it's time to get it

[Outro: Eminem, Marley Marl (& Proof)]
Paul Rosenberg
I'd like to thank y'all for comin' by, man
Y'all just ripped that
Did you rip my damn microphone?
Paul Rosenberg is a small frozen turd
Why y'all just ripped my damn microphone?
(Nah, we ain't did nothin' yet, yo)
Aye, peace London
Ma-Ma-Ma-Marley
Peace
Marley, Tim, I love y'all, peace
Thank you very much for havin' us



[Verse 1: Stat Quo]
I boss how I live
Fuck 'em hoe
God meant me
To push Bentleys
The Stat Quo
Still slammin' 'lac doors
This squad 'ill blow your brain out
Half-crazy
Bustin' out the window
Aight cut it, cook it, bag it
Distribute it through the city
Home get that cabbage
Take it, flip it
Turn illegal to legal
Launder, stay grindin'
Keepin' ya business on the under
Humble moves come up
Cops run up
But most of them corrupt
So what?
They want they cut
So pay 'em
All those who oppose the squad
Spray 'em
Got goons with MACs
Who kill for scratch
Okay I'm
One quick trip 'ill
And get you filled with gas
Broad day and niggas 'ill kill you
Without the mask
I'm getting bank
Like I'm shooting it from off the glass
Signed with Shady-Aftermath
Cause I'm after cash
Biatch

[Verse 2: Swift]
The way it go
Just heard my dog
Stat Quo flow
Ha, ya heard what he had to say
Use the words Swifty McVay
I'm ill enough to shoot a nigga through his pager
And if I missed
The shit's going exactly through his neighbor
My behavior's
Fatal enough to faint niggas
Old age and cradle
I shoot from unexpected angles
I changed ya facials
I could have you niggas hugging an angel
Literally
Niggas be crazy
I'm misery, breaking both of ya ankles
I diminish mentally
I turn you into a mimic of Kennedy
I don't go to sleep 'till I murder motherfuckers in trilogies
I recruit enemies
Friends ain't shit
They take yo ends and split
Willingly
What kind of shit got a nigga faking the funk
Dressed like George Clinton
But you hoes ain't making a buck
You out and about
With yo face frostbit
With a hustlin' mouth
But you really full of brussels sprouts
Husband or spouse
Your generation's running out
Because my gun's in ya mouth
Penetration coming (cumming) fast
We won, you lost
You got a witness program
Move out cold then John Walsh
Wild
And this the way we do
Emzy, Imma pass it to you
So what ya wanna do?

[Pre-Verse: Eminem]
What I wanna do? What I wanna do?
Let me see right here, yo

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Not many people that I label would be able
To display table manners, but our plan is
To make this beat rock like scanners and make the fans just
Go bananas, yo, get our planners
That means our nuts for the sluts who don't under-
Stand this, yo, my plan is, yeah right
And y'all gon' stand there and act like you don't understand it
Like my name is Janet, my titty fell out and I ain't plan it
Yo, check thischeck this out
And if you rocking with ya necklace out, that's my breakfast now
I'mma snatch it, yo, my style is wretched
You can't fetch it, no you can't stretch it
And yo, it doesn't really matter
Cause ya name I can't even pronunciate, you the
Same type of mo'fucker to go and sucker
Punch Dre at the Vibe Awards, but he right behind the boards
The next day, so kiss an ass
Or kiss a dick, lick a dick, eat my ass
Whatever you won' do it's on you
Big Proof coming through with the mo

[Verse 4: Proof]
Y'all niggas sing
Y'all done came to the Nina Ross war
Ya homie's a killa
But my killas they cost more
It's all inherited
I was boss born
Put eighteen in ya flesh
And make ya chest a golf course
Niggas know that we ain't even
You know why
(gasps) I'm still breathin'
Yeah I got that real heathen
With them steel beams on 'em
Through ya dreams on 'em
Like I'm still a fiend
Noted for mics
It's only right
You see my real team, brody
I do it live
I was sippin' on some cream soda
Heave phony
Fuck this back and forth
This ain't a tennis meet
I spray you industry gangstas
Cause they ain't in the streets
It's cool to beef
But why?
'Till you truce with or you trust me
I told you Puffy
And you can lose Big (B.I.G.)
I'm Proof
Who you could do big things with us
Spit dope
They call me Rick James bitch
Clip-clack
Bang-hit
Bang-drip
Drip fang of blood
Drip, drip, drank when sirens cop came
Body bag thick
Body bag, zip-zip
That's it
Fuck you bitch

[Stat Quo]
Down a dark street
It's the dirty Stat Quo
Lord have mercy
Breathe, hello I'm 'bout my cheese
The steez, mellow
Cash in the bank
On my grind in the paint
Oh, look how I do live with my boy Westwood
Up to no good
Smoking that good shit
See how I ball
Handle, handle my business
Eminem, Swift, P, Stat Quo that's it
Back on the track
Green Lantern done switched the beat
I'm guaranteed to my thang and drop the heat
My man Zeke is in the corner with him
Boss Hog, A-town, yes I be them
Do what I do freestyle, top of the dome
Don't fuck with my click
Leave Doc Dre alone
If I see you out the wars
Imma stab yo' ass
Whoop yo' ass
Ya fuck with me
I make ya handicap
And I pass the mic to my man Swifty
McVay he don't play

[Swift]
I'm Swifty McVay
Ya bastard out the blue
I'm hazard
I even haunt spirits that's after you
I'm cancerous with no answer
Pharmaceutic, I turn you allergic to being human
It ain't new
It's what I do when I'm feudin'
A sick nuisance
I have ya had
Until motherfuckers lookin' like Rick Rubin
What do you do to fools that think that they can take laughs?
Their face get sliced
And that's what's up
I inherit the power of all the rappers
I gotta be like Kruger
All them niggas bodies are coming out of me
I usually pack a Ruger
Now I see that I can be successful
By bruisin' yo chest
Without a thing
A professional
I'm a king that slaughtered kings
Exceptional, genetically raised by wolverines nigga
I give a fuck on what niggas seen
I'll send a fiend to pitifully raise you
And then convene bitch
That's what we do
Our crew D12
Rapping nigga
In take the Nina off the shelf
And I'm hazard for ya health
Like I said before
The type to walk the streets
And the five-o ignore
Me when they see me
Dog, I'll burn you like VD
And that's the way we be
Fuck you!

[Tim Westwood]
Easy, easy
I'm trying to hold a job down here
Yeah, yeah
I apologize if anyone's offended
You know tune out go to something else
Come back later
It's going down
It's real hip-hop
There's gonna be some swear words
Be prepared
Change the station if you ain't built

[Eminem]
Aftermath in the house now
Get yo' fricking mouth stabbed out
Y'all get so mad
Get so livid
Looking for dap from anyone who would give it
Now how you gon' value
Someone else's opinion
Cause you selfish
I'm rap's Elvis
Everybody try to grab the helm-ets and they hardhats
Run and duck for cover
Yo, fuck ya mother
What the fuck are ya?
Yo, I'm sprayin'
While I'm playin'
I ain't playin'
I'm sprayin' at your feet
Like hey Imma cock the hand
Imma pull my cock out
Outta my pajamas
And cock back the cock
Like it's chicken
Yo, check it out
The clock is ticking
It's countdown to Armageddon
And there's nothing you can do to stop it
Put your arm or head in
Or put a pen in it
But once the grenade pin is pulled
It's nothing you could do
But end up in the hospital
Yeah, yeah
Hospital, pital, 'spitals
End up in the 'spital
And y'all can eat my tender vittles
I don't really give a fudge
Fudge, fudge-packers
Is what y'all are
And y'all get smacked up
At the awards show
However you want it to go
We can make it go either way
Biatch
That's itch-bay backwards
F around and smack turds
They told us not to use no cuss words
So we gon' not use cuss words
And say busters instead
Have you all bleeding red
Damn, right out of yo' head
That's what I said
And my name ain't Fred
My name ain't special ed
And it ain't my birthday
But Proof can get on the mic in the worst way
And I don't even have to curse to say

[Proof]
Proof's a wolf
Grab ya pooper-scooper
Follow me
I fight to the death
Like Apollo Creed
I only hang with bitches that swallow seeds
Air Force Ones not Wallabees
Hollow tease
I be, rushin' colonies
I'm known by all blacks in hoods
Like collard greens
Last of a dyin' breed
Old school like Model Ts
When I ride on my rivalries
Like 2Pac writ
Put you in the I.C.U
With no eye sockets
More than five shots spit
So you can die hot bitch
It's only one topic
I need profit
Fuck the gossip
Harry the hype-writer
The night lighter
The only thing higher than Proof
Nigga is my lighter
I'm watchin' you fly niggas crash
Like Al-Qaeda
Crime fighter
Guess I rhyme by the mind tighter
Than the World Trade
Bit the jaws
Like Jay Dee
I put my fucking dick to broads
Broads, dog that's down on all fours
Of course I'm down to get yours
How come my niggas stop cold
When they heard capsule?

Dropped outta high school

Green is on the turntable
Why not do this shit daily, all year

[Stat Quo]
Hey doll, cheer

You don't want the pressure

Underneath my seat's a grown weather here
Peepin' my packer

Wheels, ransom notes, and checks

Process of elimination is always complete
When I hit the streets

Hennessy don't do nothing but give you lumps

Turning you niggas all to monks
Red dots amongst ya foreheads
You get punctured once
Slump cowards with Ninas bitch

Faces lookin' like pizzas
An animal instinct
I eat ya with cannibalistic procedures
Adam's apple some womens' fetuses
Me is just like special nature

And yes I hate to
See ya wack emcees
Step inside my face
And ya know my fo-fo (four-four) will clear the place
Ya runnin', I'm gunnin'

He said don't cuss
But I couldn't help it
I take my belt off whip ya wit'  it
Because I'm selfish
So I, just do the things I do
I freestyle for you
Then I pass it to my crew
Then they pass it back
And if ya wack
Then get slapped
For that type of

[Eminem]
Acid rap
Yeah and that's a fact
Slim Shady's back
Got eighty ladies layin' on they back
Yo, but I'm a mack
I'm a little nuts for Brittany
Little to sane for Whitney
Tell you the truth
Yo, Bobby would prolly get me
Catch me in the lobby
After he just hit me
After he sniffed three lines
He'd prolly knock out Fifty
He could prolly lift up both of us
And spin us both on both fingers like donuts
Yo, I party hard
But for real, I want Bobby Brown as my bodyguard
And that's for real
And that's the deal
Cause we got mass appeal
And I don't think that they can really take it
Cause I always let my nuts hang
Like I was doing push-ups naked
That's what I do
Is drink the Aliz and
Then I pass it to my man Proof and
Then we start goofin' around
And start spoofin'
Everybody, yo we in the party
And we could rock the party
And we could get it started
And if ya smell like (sniff)
Somebody farted
Or we can
We can do the Mardi Gardy
We could party harder
We could get started
What you wanna do
Proof, it's on you

[Proof]
It's on me
Might take it to the hip, homie

It's like Shady and Aftermath
We after cash
You want it
We gon' blast ya ass
(4x)

And listen, ya need to quit it dog
Cause Proof is low to the ground
Like midget balls
With them bridges falls
I lock ya ass up on the game
And I visit all
And it's like they signed
They said they did it all
Because they breeches small
But Imma tell you
In the likeness of the great 2Pac
I'm hot
And I'm fatter then Biggie Smalls
All y'all, need to recognize
Cause where I come from
It's still the East side
Over there by Dresden
Where we make their heads spin
Back then the back, ten
Make his ass backspin
This action of crack-skin
Nigga, I eat more Vicodin
Than the dots that's on the Pac-Man, board
Oh Lord
Give me my sword
On top of that
The freestyles I got you can't afford
But they free
Yo, they only cost attention
And did I mention
I'm a boss with henchmen
I send niggas to get ya
Yo, it's easy to do
How ya feel about this
Yo, the piece of the Proof
The piece of the clue
The pieces ya need
The pieces I got
On top of that my freestyle
Never stutter
My words are butter-rock
Like the niggas feel about us
I say precise
Nigga feel fucked up like D-Nice, did
For getting Scott La Rock slain
I rock 'caine and rock brains
Back in the day, when ya block came
Get ya block slain
Ya hood aborted
How I feel when they all get shortened
Haha
And I tell ya like this
Ya missing the ending
I lift ya whole hood
Like I'm fixing ya engine
Nigga, come on

[Stat Quo]
I keep my brim tilted
And tracked, I killed it
Atlanta, my city
I built it
Watch this
Young beast bob and weave
Young Stata (Status) make it hard to breathe
Please believe
I ball for cheese
Survival of the fittest
One of the trillest ever
Bow down, he severe
Finna lock the market
Marshall and Dre don' linked up
With the boy from the A
I am chillaxin'
Fine linen in my fashion
Bump yo' questions
Why you askin', anythang?
Niggas wanna know what I'm on
Riding on my enemies
Getting them gon' huh
A crime businesses
And you need homes
Something I can flip to increase my grip
Yo, why they on my dick?
Ride ya own lane
I gotta handle
Trust me lil' man
Ya need a little change
Here's for starters
I show ya how to come up
Work on martyr
Launder ya cheese
Do cash and beauty parlors
Hustle smarter
Green got me, haha
Green got me
Imma kill you Green

[Swift]
To me it's like second nature
I treat murders like a recreation
And these niggas steadily changing
They laughs like Mason
T.D. Jakes and all of these fake gangstas
They all be awaking
Because McVay can put a date on you homes
I'll engrave in ya tombstone
With urination
Now your whole funeral soon blown
Communication are for fools who be wasting time
Contemplating on making up
I ain't that guy
A grudge holder
I used to shove boulder in the counsel of my Aurora
Get caught and tell 'em it's yours
I can leave each one of ya body parts
Stranded in the middle of different forests
Having police ignore the shit
Niggas get hung like ornaments
While they hanging they trees
They get bombed like Vietnamese
In '46 or whatever year it was
I gotta buzz
And murdering you is all I love
This is Swifty McVay
I ain't by myself
I got Em, Proof, and Stat that be hot
And D12 is over, D12 is over here
And yo' death is near
And that's what's up

[Eminem]
That's what's up
Pass this cup
And then we blast you up
Freestyle right off the massive truck
We got truckloads
And uff, no
Cuff no and spin it backwards
And play it back later
Cause all y'all haters rockin' gators
Alligators, we see ya later
We ain't player haters
But yo check it out
We rockin' in our Navigators
And we can sit back
And we can stretch, we can check
Trek, I mean catch, anything
And we can fetch
I'm slurring a little bit
But during the part that I was doing
The urination, upon that girl and
Wait a minute, I ain't goin'
There with my rap
I ain't tryin' to be starting no crap
But yo, I be flowin'
With the stuff and I be knowin'
That when I start raking out them leaves
I be hoein'
And that's six in the mornin'
And we can do it
We can get it on until the crack of dawn and
We can get it on with Tim Westwood
We can do whatever you want
Bring ya best cause
We do what we want to do
On this microphone
Cause we ought to know
Or ought to inform you
That we get warm too warm
Sometimes we too hot to
Not to spit this ish
Spit it backwards and that said shit
Whoops, I didn't mean to curse
But yo Proof, come back
And lay one verse

[Proof]
I don't bite
But I spit the killin' venom
When I'm older
My pockets gon' blow up like Brazilian women
You can fight me here
Like some Big (B.I.G.) and Pac shit
Breaking laws off him dog
And hypnotic, he got it
Although he sound sober
I ain't gay nowhere near gay
I even hate a brown-noser
It's over, he killa
Got no skills
When these twenty-two spins
Ain't got nothing to do with Diablo wheels
Even the bible kills
I burn moral themes
Y'all pop like MTV
And talk more than Coral Jeanne
The poor foreseen that there is a God
I hope you guys slack
Cause when I lean back
Without the Terror Squad
I gotta two bigger
Then pistol move niggas whip
I leave fool ass lit
Like a cool cigarette
I'm 'bout the peace dude
In fact the peaceful
Since these niggas know my piece full
And since they watchin' Beef too
They watchin' niggas out here
They see how we go
Back in the day
With what, my people
The desert eagle
Leaving people living in deceased holes
How they feel about that?
My truck is all diesel
Freeze hoes
These people know it
G.L. in detail
They break like Lee nail
Crew is D12
More noise than a seashell
Cause we shall prevail
Without the Martin Luther King drill

[Eminem]
How you know the main side, so attraction
Psycho action
The man 'ill throw up on Michael Jackson
Sick enough to do anything
In any video
I could even pull out my whole titty yo
Wouldn't mean a damn thing
Wouldn't mean nothing
Like if you went and pulled hamstring
Cause you a fake 'iatch
I took the b off
Cause Imma be off with the switch
Just like you
Cause you walk with a switch too
That's what I meant
Cause I represent, every single day
Pass it off to Stat

[Stat Quo]
I'm so slum
I pull up in a double-quad deuce with no roof
On them big ass boots
White tee, no suit
Just me and my troop
Jam and be some hustlers
We are not a group
Grizzles, love me cause my smile is priceless
My advice, my life
I have them wetter than diapers
She want me to buy big jewels and wife her
Fuck the bitch tonight
But tomorrow won't like her
Go back to the club
And get a new one like her
And that's what I call completing a cypher
Wrassle with the bitches so they call me Roddy Piper
When a Stat come through
Your girlfriend get hyper

[Swift]
You be in the ocean with the worms and maggots
I'm what overdoses do for an addict
And after static with me
Holy ghosts will be given a homes
Automatically, it's either that or be rolled in a hole
I target ya dome
Watch that shit get blown
Like a head gasket
See I'm rabid
And known to foam acid
I accurately mastered battering bastards
I don't get charged for assault and battery
They be after me
Cause I smashed 'em
Happily answering
Any nigga that asks me would happen
I tell 'em the truth laughin'
That's just me
A five-star general
With aura that's horrible
I be smackin' ya captain
Turn a corpse into ya corporal
They won't know who did it
Tell your lieutenant
When an arsenal is set
For all of those threats of coming close
No you won't
With a Stephen King mentality
Ya don't believe me?
I can bring the casualty to ya family
And that's what's up
I got D12 in the house
Ya know what we about
Are you a man, a mouse?
And it seems like you a mouse
Running in that hole
Just cause you hoe
And everybody know
McVay yeah

[Proof]
See I'm going out
Blow 'em up
They wanna see me, what I'm all about
Pull 'em out
I'm in the club
Got the snub
'Bout to bust it out
Boy hear me, 'bout to hear me
'Bout to cuss a dog
I can't take it

[Eminem]
Can't cuss it dog
Take it dog
Ayo, get with the
With the girl
Better take it off
She got the bra better shake it y'all
Ayo, check it out
I'm about to bull
And wreck it out

[All]
Smack 'em with shovels
Smack 'em with shovels
Smack 'em with shovels
Smack 'em with shovels

[Eminem]
You gon' make us freestyle for all
Make us freestyle for all
Make us freestyle for all
Make us freestyle for all
Tim you gon' make us freestyle for all

[All]
Freestyle forever
Freestyle forever
Freestyle forever

[Eminem]
Tim gon' make us freestyle forever



How the fuck he got an Oscar
Passed out in his red Mazda
With his fucking head in his pasta
In the parking lot of K-Mart plaza
Across from the Red Lobster
Looking like the Loch Ness Monster
Dressed like a cross-dressed mobster
Talk is cheap, it costs less to gossip
I'll probably be a lot less hostile
If you snots kept your schnozzes out the air holes
You'll get fucked in all seven holes
Ass, mouth, pussy yeah, both ears and ha yes nostrils
At the OzzFest with Nas
Bumping Das EFX in a wrecked up Datsun
And dropped two extra strength Watson Vicodin out my pocket
They cost less
I'm a hot mess
Cause I tripped and got my head stuck
In a wasps nest in the process, awesome
Drunk as fuck, one sock
Pulling my boxers up with boxing gloves
But I keep dropping my fucking binoculars
Got two fucking Hydroxycuts
And four oxis stuck in my esophogus
These three lesbian little stocky sluts
Thought I swallowed two hockey pucks
Started screaming "serves you right you cocky fuck
That's what you get for mocking us
Ain't as cool as you thought you was"
Bitch all I did when I walked up was have my dick in a sock
Said it was a sock puppet
So no strings attached
You can all suck it
Chicka get it, ah fuck it
Shits bout to get as hairy as motherfucking Chewbaca's nuts
Cocksuckas



[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Ryan's a homicidal misfit, I write the solution of biophysics
On the side of a cliff in some hieroglyphics
This my admission to having violent psychotic wit
Devour, polish it, politics
By the way I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower tip
I like writing, but I will stick this pencil in your ass
Before I write your shit, pause, inhaling hella kush
Us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push
Felons, crooks, going door-to-door
Like we selling books, Dolly Parton style, melons mushed
Now my bitch a dancer, I'm about as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style, you'd probably rip your pants up
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
It probably will smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
They call me Anchorman, I hold down the ship
Leave you niggas floating in water, then go and drown a fish
Fuck, I'm fucking heinous, I make you fucking famous
Them lead showers is coming, fuck is you saying?

[Verse 2: Eminem]
FUCK! It's fucking raining, SHIT! There's lightning, BITCH!
It's thundering cause I'm cussing up a storm if you wondering, SHIT!
SHIT! You couldn't muster up enough thought
To take a dump during a brain fart, chump
If you want urine in your face, all you had to do was say
That you wish you would've just stayed pissed off in the first place
We came to monopolize the game, Illuminati is here
Yeah, human oddities, at odds with us, your squad's gotta be
Cause we started out cold in a snowball, we froze
Soon as we rolled up on these hoes, all's we know
Is y'all lowered the bar like limbo, you know who you are
So quit fucking the dog before we start calling YOU Bizarre
Shit, screw the pooch, y'all done raped a pitbull
Fell in love with the shih-tzu, this missile's directed directly at you
And this for these hoes who don't know me from a can of paint
You must be huffing, fuck a ball sack
If the taints can't take you on a date, you mistake me for a gentleman
You 2000 and late, man, and Will I ain't, I'm the bad guy
Type of guy that will drag five girls up on stage
Pour ice in their pants, and the first one who pees gets a black eye

[Chorus: Eminem]
Must be outta your mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up
This game is over

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Puffin' loosies, watching "I Love Lucy" with Gary Busey
Crazy, how the fuck could you son me? I'm Shady
Will there ever come a day when they could slay me?
I don't know, fifth month, black and yellow insect, maybe
'Til then I kill the bad man trying to slay me
Everything you kick weak, your spit kung fughesi
All my homeboys, 2.0 Boys
Nickel, I just picked up a Phantom, look how it rolls, Royce
Even if I wanted to quit, I ain't got no choice
Verses keep coming, I should invoice my own voice
You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist
Hoes be like diamonds in your chain, man, so moiss
Bang bang, bang bang, House Gang, chainsaw
Here to kill you pussies, don't ask what we came for
I write until my right arm veins sore
Forearm feel like Thor's arm in a gang war
You hear that? Yaowa, you know who finna fall out
Definitively finish you, my fist take out that eyeball
Piranha mentality with a Jaws bite all night
Coming up, never saw light, but never lost sight

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Jets and movers, cesspoolers, meth abusers
You step to us, text Rugers to respect the shooters
My men think in sync, roll with the best crew
Move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger
Welcome to Nayhood, big in the 'jects, G
Cheated death multiple times without rigging the deck
So I'm well-prepped if you just want war
There will be blood everywhere, you be laying on the Louboutin floor
It's raw, you keeping acting like you don't know Mouse, nigga
And you going to need the best doctors, House nigga
Guard your jewels and avoid large tools
Cause after I spill you at the light, you be in a car pool
Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told
They food for thought's rotten, they gems are fool's gold
Need results from my actions, mistakes I'll exonerate
I'm Martin King staring at a picture of Obama's face
Talking funds, niggas ain't never seen stock
I don't need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock

[Chorus: Eminem]
Must be outta your mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up
This game is over

[Verse 5: Crooked I]
Take off, you invited inside of the mind of
A psychotic rhymer, I'm kind of a (Dahmer)
I'm grinding up rappers are lining up jackers, I'm climbing up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors, I'm the genuine article
But read me wrong, get my gun and split you to particles
(The gold hand) Tell me when and I'm there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like unlimited fare
You got us pegged wrong, my circle don't fit in with squares
I smell shit and piss, know where it's coming from
You stepped on number two just to be number one
Now I'm a step on you, bring it to your yard
Bogart for arts, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the West
I'm Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart

[Verse 6: Yelawolf]
I got Jim Beam in the liver, getting head like clean clippers
With haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
When I throw up 16's like I drink liquor
You think you seen sick? Well, bitch, you ain't seen sicker
Than a cracker that will hop around in a hospital gown
Popping the trunk, my pump will stay cocking the round
I shit logs and I piss river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that's as close as I get to a pyramid
Shit, they think I'm Illuminati, so fucking ignorant
Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win, they say you a sin, but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing
Skinny-ass pants sagging, it's only yourself you playing
Call me a clown, but you love what the clown's sanging
I'm a freak shows at the county carnival, then you paying
Bitch, I'm on a trapeze with no legs in the dark
Yelling "Go Shady!" Driving slower than an old lady
In an old '89, no piece if you pay me
Give me peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes
I'm getting paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago would have broken most of you crazies
They call me crazy cause I made it
Bitch, you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lately
You ain't fucking with Budden, you ain't got no choice with Royce
You don't want to see the Crooked I, well, listen to Ortiz voice
That dirt road hit the 8 Mile, the point oh boys
And if Marshall want me to clap, then, homie, I deploy game over

[Outro: Eminem & Yelawolf]
Yo, I don't think they heard you, tell 'em again
Game over!



[Produced by DJ Khalil & Danny Keyz]

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late
(I can't keep chasing you
I'm taking my life back)
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life, I woulda laid
Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you, no more pain
Bitch, you took me for granted
Took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt, I can no longer stand it, now my respect, I demand it
I'ma take control of this relationship, command it
And I'ma be the boss of you now, goddamn it
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid?
Look at how I dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothin' left
But you keep treatin' me like a staircase: it's time to fuckin' step
And I won't be comin' back, so don't hold your fuckin' breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in-depth
I told you you'd be sorry if I fuckin' left
I laughed while you wept, how's it feel now?
Yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me
Did me a favor, though, my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate, but it's

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
(Can't take no more)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you, all you do is laugh
Cause that ain't good enough
You expect me to fold myself in half 'til I snap
Don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side? I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time? You don't think so, do you?
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still? Man, I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you  go marry someone else and make 'em famous!
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat
I'm moving on, forget you
Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this
So many times it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep askin' me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama
I'm drawn to shit, I guess I'm a
Mess, cursed and blessed, but this time I
Ain't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss
You're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people
Who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you, hip hop! I'm leavin' you
My life sentence is served, bitch, and it's just...

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
(I'm gone, man)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late
Caught in a chase, 25 to life



[Hook: Eye-Kyu & Eminem]
Now, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one, see
Man, what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one, see

[Verse 1: Eye-Kyu]
Yo, some people say I'm whack, now if that's right I'm
The freshest whack MC that you ever heard in your lifetime
My slick acapella sounds clever with the beats, boy
I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forget a gold digger's succubus
My soul's thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke: can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more different strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your woman
Just to keep my lyrics comin' (bitch)
We elevated to new heights, premeditated
Let it be that I stated, they hate it
Now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it, that's the reason I'm hated
To represent's my temperament
If rap was a dick, all you so called hard MCs would not be impotent, but pimpin' it
And actin' like you could rock a show
Harder than LL's rock the bells, and you's a ho
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep comin'
Like nymphomaniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah, I got somethin' for your ass to hate
I blast your hate, and have you all runnin' past the gates
And as for face clutchin' and touchin' the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Buckin' these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leavin' them hot and bothered, turned on, like an appliance
Defiance? No, we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well, I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you ain't singin' or gonna do a thing but run
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own
With the strength of Lou Ferrigno
So, stop that bullshit flow, yo
You need to come with the real skills and act like you know

[Hook: Eminem & Eye-Kyu]
Now, what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one, see
Now, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one, see

[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?
You don't know shit, so when you see one, flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never be the MC
I stopped the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure you're bound to agree, a sweet MC crash the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain round the block to jog your fuckin' memory
It's either them or me, man, kill or be killed
Your will'll be sealed, your casket closed, you still'll be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's actin' soft and he cowers, he better come cleaner
Than Jeru jackin' off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite
And wouldn't go out with a bang
I shout with a slang, simple as ABCs
Skip over the Ds and rock the microphone with ease
Dethrone MCs, and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome, like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, biters get treated with shots
I rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks of fellow followers' singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands
If they swallowed their fingers
But you can bring yours, let's see what you got
But don't front, and never try to be what you're not
'Cause you can be quick
Jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't jack

[Hook: Eye-Kyu & Eminem]
Now, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?

[Intro]
There is no escaping (Yo)
There's no place to hide (Ayo)
You scream, "Someone save me!" (Yo)
But they don't pay no mind (Ayo)
Goodnight, goodbye!

[Verse 1]
You're walkin' down a horror corridor
It's almost four in the mornin' and you're in a
Nightmare, it's horrible, right there's the coroner
Waiting for ya to turn the corner so he can corner ya
You're a goner, he's onto ya
Out the corner of his cornea, he just saw ya run
All you want is to rest 'cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
Here I sit, while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowin' a Klonopin while I'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn, holding onto the pill bottle, then
Lick my finger and swirl it 'round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at McDonald's with
Blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must've just blacked out againnot again!

[Hook]
It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em

[Verse 2]
Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube, maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana then
I reach for the aloe and lanolin, bust all over the wall panellin'
Dismantlin' every candle on top of the fireplace mantel and
Grab my flannel and my bandana, then
Kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
Causin' illusions again, brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin, razors, scissors, and pins
Jesus, when does it end? Phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who gave these molecules to
Me, what am I gon' do?
Hey, the prodigal son, the diabolical one
Very methodical when I slaughter them

[Hook]
It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em

[Bridge]
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

[Verse 3]
I cut and I slash, slice and gash, last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half-pint of the Jack, my last Vic and-a-half
A flashlight up Kim Kardashian's ass
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December, I think it was, I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin' tub, cut him up into pieces
And just when I went to drink his blood
I thought, "I oughta drink his bathwater, that oughta be fun"
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery, son
Your blood-curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 a.m. and here I come, so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here, man, there's got to be one
Oh no, there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants, top of his lungs
But ain't no stopping me from chopping him up-up, 'cause

[Hook]
It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em

[Outro]
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil rise)
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil rise)
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil rise)
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil rise)

[Verse 1]
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd, Sr
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed but kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

[Verse 2]
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4 door Ford
But I'm more towards droppin an acappella that'll chop a fella
To Mozzarella, worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your veins feeding you liquid darvocet
Pumping you full of drugs, pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants and given
A less than 20 percent chance of living
Have a possible placement, it's a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arson
To set fire to carpets and burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight, you need a crobar to pry her apart with

[Verse 3]
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with the 40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers? We blowing up your house killing your parents
And coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack today, yesterday and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!



[Verse 1]
(Aight, aight...Uh...Slim Shady...Yo, yo, yo...)
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns

[Verse 3]
(Like this, like that, like this
Like this, like that, like this)
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Sr
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood

[Verse 4]
Yo, yo, yo!
My mom sent me up to the store with a food stamp
For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the news stand (here)
Two dudes ran up and jumped out of a blue van
I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch
I swung it at the first dude, the other one with him
Seen it snap so fast, it looked like it broke before it hit him
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him, and bit him
He came back with 6 or 7 dudes screaming "GET HIM!"
I grabbed one,  lit him on fire, pinned, and bit him
The next faggot gave me his shoes like they didn't fit him
One by one I just kept dropin' 'em in a rhythm
Then I woke up swingin' the middle of the kitchen

(Damn... damn... damn...)



[Verse 1: Eminem]
You probably gonna think that I'm talking
About you and you goddamn right I am
Look at you, this is the minimal I could diss you
Subliminally, but I think criminal instinct
Has pushed me to the brink, my pussy does it stink
He still loves me 'cause he puts me in his ink
He does, doesn't he, still is, isn't he?
Nah, I'm just playing tug of war with his heart 'cause he misses me
I can still fuck him and leave him whenever I feel frisky
And is no risk of disease 'cause he ain't with anyone is he?
This bitch really thinks she can get me
If she still wants me, driving across country
Strapped up to the front seat, missing all her front teeth
Thinking to herself when's the next time he's gonna punch me?
I told this cunt she's gonna overdo it once
And once she does, she was stuffed up in a trunk
Crunch, he scrunched her up in a ball
Bunched up nice and comfy
Fuck around get dumped up in a lake 'fore you dump me
You cunning little cunt, deceitful witch
You thought you had me, 'till my shrink told me this

[Hook: Paul Simon]
The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I feel like a serial killer, I keep dumping bodies in the lake
I'mma get caught and send up the river
I shiver when I think of the company I keep
How do I know she ain't gonna kill me when I sleep
I shriek, every time she hands me something to drink
Sex kept us together, when we slept together every-thing
Was all better, she made me feel like a king
Slowly she began lowering my self-esteem
She go to the club and not answer the phone when I call her
And I just bought her a truck for 50,000 dollars
Accused me of doing drugs and scream n' holla
Then I find a bag of coke on her, some marijuana
And all I know is every time I go
To them hiding spots, wherever she hides her blow
The little bags of dope, there was a pile of coke
That's growing smaller, and that was just a while ago
And I wouldn't even let on like I know
What was I supposed to do? Call her out on it, we just argue
Say she put it there on purpose and flipped the whole script
Ooh she's a manipulative evil bitch
A cunning little cunt, little deceitful witch
She thought she had me, 'till my shrink told me this

[Hook: Paul Simon]
The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover



[Intro]
It's alright, it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Gonna make it, can't give up now
I'ma make it somehow

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might
Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up, I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been vicked
So I must then get off the bus, then split
Man, fuck this shit, yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

[Chorus]
I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan (It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land (I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands (Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back (I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin' (It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone (I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own (Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road (I'ma make it somehow)

[Verse 2]
I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryna regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryna chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man, I'm just tryna do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you, God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo, I hope you can hear me, homie, wherever you are
Yo, I'm tellin' you, dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road

[Chorus]
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan (It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land (I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands (Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back (I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin' (It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone (I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own (Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road (I'ma make it somehow)

[Verse 3]
You gotta live it to feel it; you didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin' this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen, heard, smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show to bust my flow?
Where must I go? Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket?
Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army, tryna salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryna travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, this city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin', I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo, it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin', no, next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these Free World leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road

[Chorus]
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan (It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land (I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands (Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back (I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin' (It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone (I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own (Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road (I'ma make it somehow)



[Parking Lot Rapper #2 (Obie Trice)]
[?] use my voice to spit the fiery frame
Try and refrain, dying in vain
Soon as I reply in [?]
I be the nigga in the Shelter who be eyeing your chain

[Parking Lot Rapper #3 (Njeri Earth)]
Three-one-three area, bound to bury ya with vengeance
My rhymes sentences'll put an end to your existence with the rigorousness
Niggas, I'm serious, delirious, cause a curious... pause
The fury calls from my jaws from devouring y'all raw

[Future (Mekhi Phifer)]
You forced to listen to the individual, the metaphysical
The Mac Mitten, rhyme ritual, heterosexual
Syllables they sound complex to you, lines perplexing you
With words that could put a hex on you, snap that neck on you
Murder you, boil you, we keep a white boy or two
Let my man grab the mic, you see how Bunny Rabbit do

[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
Your style is generic, mine's authentic made
I roll like a renegade, you need clinic aid
My technique's bizarre and ill; I scar and kill
You were a star until I served you like a bar and grill
As I proceed to cook and grill ya, thats all it took to kill ya
You better recognize me like I look familiar
You wanna battle? You beat around the bush
Like you're scared to lick pussy so you eat around the tush
I need a clown to push, someone that I can bully
Wait a minute, I dont think you understand fully
See me without a style's like mustard without the Heinzs
I lead the new school, you're a Busta without the rhymes
I crush the shit out your line

[Sol George (Omar Benson Miller)]
Now I'm the Rashiki smoking the lick licky
Ten freaky girls inside The Chin Tiki
Girl, when you see me you better believe me
This ain't a game and pimping ain't easy
Anything goes when it comes to hoes
I'm the kingpin when it comes to flows
You better ask someone if you don't know
When you see me girl, say what up doe
Ten freaky girls, ten, ten, ten freaky girls

Now, everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up and follow me!
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up! Look, look...
Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you gassed up
Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?
One, two, three, and to the four
One Pac, two Pac, three Pac, four
Four Pac, three Pac, two Pac, one
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherfucking MC
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standing here screaming, "Fuck the Free World!"
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dawg, you embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look
At his fucking yearbook; fuck Cranbrook!
Fuck a beat, I'll go a cappella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer
Fuck everybody! Fuck y'all if you doubt me!
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me

[Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie)]
Yo...



[B-Rabbit]
...

[Supa Emcee]
Hey yo, What up, trailer trash!

Yo Future, how'd you get whitey to battle the Savior
That's like Darth Vader battling Obey Taylor
You can't mess around with the horror
I grab the mic and Ima murder you, now you'll die tomorrow!
You can't kick with the lyrics I spit
I blow your head off and leave you dying in your blood, you bitch!
You still a trick and a hoe and Ima roll
I fucked your mama; she's a prostitute bro!
You thinking you white, but you ain't light
Ima murder you in the gang again, and blast you in de night!
Im still ill, I'm still for real with Ken Loraine;
I got a gun on your boy, Ima blow out his brain!
You run with a bunch of whack faggots
Ima eat out your meat like I'm in your body; I'm a maggot!
And yo matter of fact, you gettin' played
You ain't nothing but a white-boy dying of fucking aids!



[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
Cheddar, I can rip you to a shred a
Cheddar cheese, there's not a better MC than me
I'm B-Rabbit, bitch, sting like a bee
Float like a butterfly, what am I, so what if I
Cut a guy, did I s-s-stutter guy
Leave you punch drunk from lunch truck to Shelter
You never felt the wrath or felt the skelter, melt ya
Got the belt for the welterweight champ
You got in with a fake stamp
Garbage bag full of clothes, still pullin' hoes
Rip you from head to toe, from leg to bullet hole
Next gun pull it slow
And aim at the Free World 'fore you let it go
Instead of "Oh, I just shot my dick head"
And yes, you do got a big head
I can't call it, Cheddar where's your wallet?
You're so drunk, you can outdrink the alcoholics
Make 'em say "Damn, Cheddar's the man
He needs a can surgically removed from his hand"



[D'Phuzion]
Yo, B-Rabbit
This silly rabbit dont like lettuce I heard he like dicks
Faggot niggas, with ponytails and lipstick
I'm for real; dont give a fuck, what
What, ohh
Its like this; east side is where I'm from
You got beef hit me on the streets with a badge and a gun
Fuck the badge; I'm coming through with black mags
'Bout to do this B-Rabbit nigga 'cause he's a fag
Like I said earlier in the clause
I stated that in my, oh shit

[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
A'ight look
I can see that Im put to the test
Battling this chick, with no breasts
And why I gotta battle a chick
Especially one thats whack, wit' a dick?
So you a dope MC?
Dont get mad, start taking' your period out on me
Cause I aint done shit to you
Whats your name, Diffusion? Well then I guess I gotta diffuse you
This aint something Im used to
Why the fuck did Future even introduce you?
I really dont understand
Why this chick is up here right now and wants to be a man
On this mic its rat-a-tat-tat
Why the fuck am I standing here battling Da Brat?
You dont really even wanna see this
On this microphone I will eat your fucking fetus
Yo



I know this girl
Her name is Lily
And it's past her bed
T-I-M-E
She goes to sleep
And she can just dream
And not have to be
In a stinky trailer with me
So when I feel blue
Don't know what to do
I look at you
And I just say *Raspberry Noise*



[Lotto (Nashawn 'Ox' Breedlove)]
Yo, I'll spit a racial slur, honky, sue me
The shit is a horror flick, but the black guy doesn't die in this movie
Fuckin' with Lotto? Dawg, you gotta be kiddin'
That makes me believe you really don't have an interest in livin'
You think these niggas gon' feel the shit you say?
I got a better chance joinin' the KKK
On some real shit though, I like you
That's why I didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to
Fuck "Lotto," call me your leader
I feel bad that I gotta murder that dude from 'Leave It To Beaver'
I used to like that show, now you got me in fight-back mode
But oh well, if you gotta go, then you gotta go
I hate to do this, I would love for this shit to last
So I'll take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my ass
And all's well that ends okay
So I'll end this shit with a "Fuck you", but "Have a nice day!"

[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
Ward, I think you were a little hard on the Beaver
So was Eddie Haskell, Wally, and Ms Cleaver
This guy keeps screamin', he's paranoid
Quick, someone get his ass another steroid!
"Blah-badi-boo-blah, bah-badi-bloo-blah!"
I ain't hear a word you said: "Hippity hoopla!"
Is that a tank-top or a new bra?
Look! Snoop Dogg just got a fuckin' boobjob
Didn't you listen to the last round, meathead?
Pay attention, you're sayin' the same shit that he said
Matter of fact, dawg, here's a pencil
Go home, write some shit, make it suspenseful
And don't come back until somethin' dope hits you
Fuck it, you can take the mic home with you
Lookin' like a cyclone hit you
Tank-top screamin', "Lotto, I don't fit you!"
You see how far the white jokes get you
Boys like, "How Vanilla Ice gon' diss you?"
My motto: "Fuck Lotto!"
I get the seven digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow



[Lyckety Splyt (Strike)]
This guy's a choke artist, you'll catch a bad one
You're better off shooting yourself with Papa Doc's handgun
Climbing up this mountain, you're weak
I'll leave you lost without a paddle, floating shit's creek
You ain't Detroit, I'm the D, you're the new kid on the block
'Bout to get smacked back to the boondocks
Fucking Nazi, this crowd ain't your type
Take some real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice
And what I tell you, you better use it
This guy's a hillbilly, this ain't Willie Nelson music
Trailer trash, I'll choke you to your last breath
And have you looking foolish
Like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself
Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that
'Cause you follow Future like you got carrots up his ass crack
And when you acting up that's when you got jacked up
And left stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up
I'll crack your shoulder blade
You'll get dropped so hard that Elvis will start turning in his grave
I don't know why they let you out in the dark
You need to take your white ass back across 8 Mile to the trailer park

[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
This guy raps like his parents jerked him
He sounds like Erick Sermon, the generic version
This whole crowd looks suspicious
It's all dudes in here, except for these bitches
So I'm a German, eh?
That's okay, you look like a fuckin' worm with braids
These Leaders of the Free World rookies
Lookie, how can 6 dicks be pussies
Talkin' 'bout shits creek
Bitch, you could be up piss creek with paddles this deep
You're still gonna sink, you're a disgrace
Yeah, they call me Rabbit, this is a turtle race
He can't get with me, spitting this shit wickedly
Lickety shot suspicious spickety split lickety
So I'ma turn around with a great smile
And walk my white ass back across 8 Mile



[Marv Won]
Yo, yo, y'all ready for death? Y'all ready for death?
Marv Won, the Fat Killer
The game done got ugly, let's go, yo, yo
I seen your type before, you think you're tough
Battle you? Bitch, you lucky I don't beat you up
In a game of fisticuffs, I'll push your face back
You can't fuck with me, man, really, just face facts
It's him versus me in a battle of ten rounds
It's like Muggsy Bogues tryin' to fuck with Jim Brown
Dumb fuck, I'm the type to run amok
Come in the club drunk as fuck
Slap your bitch so we can buck
One hook... type of a man the size of Dan Dierdorf
Tryin' to take his ear off, like Mike Tys
I'm quite nice on fight nights
And why he poppin' shit? Man, I thought he liked life
Apparently not, I'm incoherently hot
And if I miss you then your parents get shot
Yo, I'm a bad boy, bitch, it's on
I'll put 44's on your chest like you're Rick Mahorn

[B-Rabbit]
Hold on, faggot, let me turn this mic on
Don't think for a minute I'ma let you
Get away with that song
'Cause that shit was wack, you ain't spittin'
As a matter of fact, all of that shit was written
And I know it wasn't for me
Surely, you really must adore me
Now, look it yo, you might as well move  to Italy
Look, this guy's ripped...*skkkrr*  literally
You don't wanna really fuck with this
On this microphone, I'm not Snuffleupagus
But I don't give a fuck, you can keep that dull rap
And turn your ass back around with your fuckin' skullcap
And your bandana or your motherfuckin' sweatband
Fuckin' with this style, you're a dead man
I ain't Redman, but on this mic, yo, I pick it up
Just like your face when I had to rip it up
You don't wanna see me, yo, uh



[Maurice Grant]
The Shelter
Let me get up in this nigga like smashin'
With a red beam Johny blastin'
Evil is the rhyme assassin
Get a guy runnin', like haulin' ass
Bury you pink rabbits for askin'
Closed caption nigga don't say a word
When these flames get to burnin' up
Burnin' you down
Leavin' you ground tore up
From the pressure
Wanna frown
Don't want the nigga known pullin' triggers
Hoist this fool on my neck back-break this nigga

[B-Rabbit]
Yo
Check it out
Look, look
Yo, I gotta flow
I'm from the Mo, you ain't Detroit, hoe
Talkin' about seven mile, change your style
I read your bio, you're really from Ohio
I'm vile
This guy's so fuckin' fat I can't even see his eyes when he smiles
Yo, listen to this
Motherfuckin' rhyme, yo chicken, we can do this
As a matter of fact have another beer
I'll be right back, dawg, I'ma set the mic right here



[Future (Mekhi Phifer)]
Well, Jimmy moved in with his mother
'Cause he ain't got no place to go

[Rabbit (Eminem)]
And now I'm right back in the gutter
With a garbage bag that's full of clothes

[Future (Mekhi Phifer)]
Buss it, buss it, 'cause
You live at home in a trailer
What the hell you gonna do?

[Rabbit (Eminem)]
'Cause I live at home in a trailer
Mom, I'm comin' home to you

[Future (Mekhi Phifer)]
Uh, break it down, uh

[Rabbit (Eminem), Mekhi Phifer, Both]
Well, my name is Jimmy, his name's Greg Buehl
Me, him and you we went to the same school
This ain't cool, I'm in a rage
He's tappin' my mom we're almost the same age
On the microphone I drop bombs
Look at this car, thanks a lot, mom (ha ha)
Here, happy birthday, Rabbit
Here's a brand new car, you can have it
A 1928 Delta
This shit won't even get me to The Shelter
And I can't even say I'm from Motown
'Cause I'm back in the 810 now

'Cause I live at home in a trailer
Mom, I'm comin' home to you



[Vanessa (Miz-Korona)]
Man, Im gettin' so sick and tired of fuckin' with this steel
They only give us 30 minutes to eat lunch and chill
My body achin' just to get a buck
Im sick of eatin' this shit off this fuckin' lunch truck
Nasty-ass food, Im in a nasty-ass mood
I shouldve called in sick, shit, I had somethin' to do

[Mike (Xzibit)]
I cant believe that Im hearing all this ravin' and rantin'
From Vanessa up in here at the New Detroit stampin'
You need to get your food and take your ass back to work
You're dreamin' if you think them corny-ass raps will work
Look at yall standin' out here, freezin' like dumb fucks
Rappin' away for food off this ragedy lunch truck
Who want what? Who pumped up to get rolled up?
I spit venom in every direction, soak some up
Look at this fat-ass nigga, sloppy sucker
You're a ugly motherfucker, your pop shouldve wore a rubber
Stop rhymin', keep your day job, Vanessa
Next time leave that bullshit home on the dresser
Speaking of dresses, take a look at Paul the fruitcake
When you travel you probably pack panties in your suitcase
Made out of lace from Victorias secret
If ten men came in a cup youd probably drink it

[Jimmy (Eminem)]
Okay, folks, enough with the gay jokes
Especially from a gay broke bitch yourself, hey lo'
This guy's a doo-doo
You've worked here longer than me
And I get paid more than you do
Dawg, take a seat
Whats this guy standing in line for? He aint got money to eat!
Check this out, yo yo
This guy cashed his whole check and bought one ho-ho
Fuckin' homo! Little maggot
You cant hack it; Pauls gay, you're a faggot
At least he admits it, dont even risk it
This guy's starvin' to death, someone get him a biscuit!
I dont know what they told you, Mike
You must had them cornrows rolled too tight
This job, you wanna quit, but you cant
Youve worked at this plant so long, you're a plant
Look at your goddamn boots!
For Christ sakes, theyre starting to grow roots!
On this mic you get faded
You look like a pissed-off rapper who never made it
And why you fuckin' with the gay guy, G?
When really you're the one who's got the HIV
Man, Im done with this clown, he's soft
Fuck it, Ill let homegirl finish you off

[Vanessa (Miz-Korona)]
A guy like you would never get a real woman
You jackass, go jack off; that's the only way you cumin'



[Intro - Eminem]
WAAAAHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOO!!! {*laughs*}
Guess who's back?!?!
Mommy! We're home!!
Say hello to my little friends
DJ Muggs, Soul Assassins Cypress Hill
Everybody! Put your hands where my eyes can see!!!

[Verse - Eminem]
Everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck
Fourty fifty Samoans they knowing when D-Bo was 50 Tweezy, Obie there won't be no hoe in us
They pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does
From New York down to Texas, back up to Los Angeles
We've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
You may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us
It's funny I guess money does have its advantages
And it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
It's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much
It's just, that if someone ever does put us in the clutch
We just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it
Cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
You fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
That you got no business being in we ain't even gon be in it
No one's gunna hear nothing, no one's gunna see this shit
And they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is bout it, bout it
The noise from (?) be drowned out by the crowd
And you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
Till the club closes, and clears out and that's when they see you flatened
Nobody saw it happen, all cause your jaws are flapping
And you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping
It ain't about the music no more, it's bout trying to show off
And it feels like any minute the bomb is bout to go off

[Chorus - Eminem]
Shit's about to change, cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin sprayed cause
Hip-hop is in a state of 911
It ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
Cause hip-hop is in a state of 911

[Verse - B-Real]
Step off my holster cause shit it's getting serious
All these drugs you be fucking with make you delirious
Thinking you coming with heat, yo son, I'm curious
How long are you gunna hate us and judge us and jury us?
Some people can never fade us, that make us so furious
Mistake us for fakers, homie we greater and glorious
We living for real and others just making the stories up
Allusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks
If you take a fucking minute to think about what you've done
When you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun
Got a hot one, spraying you bitches til there is none
I'm like a rolling stone homie, I got you under my thumb
Silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
We cut you and give you stitches, for envy and all my riches
Your game's just like a midget, you're clocking a small digit
Dealing with the Giant Goliath, people that's how we live it, c'mon

[Chorus]
Shit's about to change, cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin sprayed cause
Hip-hop is in a state of 911
It ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
Cause hip-hop is in a state of 911

[Verse - Ganxsta Ridd]
Uh, gangsta Ganxsta who come to pay you a visit
On this shit you call hip-hop, this function is where did it
When I - put it in motion, my focus is getting branded
My appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
Got you - stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers
But you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamour
When you - enter the business you thinking you running shit
You witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit!
We gangstas we blast first, ask questions later
All these - imitators parading like they some playas
Trying to - save hip-hop the task is something greater
Cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
Get caught, I'm not telling, or more like killing not caring
I'm riding a - gangsta feeling, no fearing when gangstas dying
I'm in a - full circle with homies that's supposed to bleed
On an 8 Mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'s

[Chorus]
Shit's about to change, cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin sprayed cause
Hip-hop is in a state of 911
It ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
Cause hip-hop is in a state of 911



Weed lacer
'97 burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary
Had to ditch the Mercury Tracer
I'm on some Loc shit
Some fed up wit the 'being broke' shit
I'm not to joke with
Bitch, I don't sell crack
I smoke it
Having a coke fit and going through withdrawals daily
Shoot up with mescaline in front of my baby daughter Hailey
My brains dusted
I'm disgusted at all my habits
Too many aspirin tablets
Empty medicine cabinets
Losing battles to wack rappers because I'm always too blunted
Walking up in the cypher smoking
Talking about, "Who want it"
Thug and a crook
Every drug in the book
I've done it
My 9's at your brain
Is that your chain
Run it
Crews die from an overdosage of excessive flavour
Aggressive nature's got me sticking you for your progressive pager
Spectacular
Battle rap manufacturer
Stole your mama's Acura
Wrecked it and sold it back to her
Cruise in Nike jackets
Escaped from psychiatrics
Told the nurse to save my bed for me
"I might be back quick"
So barricade your entrance
Put up some extra fences
A woman beater
Wanted for repeated sex offences
Chasing dips
Take them on long vacation trips
Kidnapping them and trapping them in abusive relationships
Mess up your face and lips
Slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Got you with that razor that I use to shave my nuts with
Mama don't you cry
Your son's too far gone
I'm so high
I don't even know what label I'm on
I'm messed up
I feel just like an overworked plumber
I'm sick of the crap
What's Jack Kevorkian's phone number



[Intro]
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
No matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
I would never give you up for nothin'
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

[Verse 1]
C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (Yeah)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I (See, honey)

[Verse 2]
There's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
Was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time out
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo-ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Verse 3]
Wake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you scweamin' in her ear (Mama)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (Yeah)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee
There goes Mama, spashin' in the water
No more fightin' with Dad, no more restraining order
No more step-dada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you love her (Mommy)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Outro]
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you
Your dada will always be here for you
Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
If you ever need me, I'ma always be here for you
You ever need anything, just ask
Dada will be right there
Your dada loves you
I love you, baby



[Intro]
Blastin' off(Aw yeah!)
Yo, I'm sayin' though, you understand what's going on London?

[Pre-Performance Ad-Libs]
One two, one two
One two, one two, one two
Y'all done started something that you can't undo
Yo, yo

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm up in the spot with Tim Westwood
You wanna step to this? You better use your best foot
Flawless freestyles I drop right off the top
Take a bottle of beer and bite off the top
Right of the block, straight to your neighbourhood
The flavor's good in London and I'ma stay for good
Yo, check it out, it's Slim Shady
I rip the radio right off of the S baby
Y'all can't see me 'cause y'all don't wanna even be it
Y'all don't understand these freestyles when I MC it
Original bad boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place, blowed and sprayed Puffy with mace
I lace the weed with insect repellent, better check the smelly
Eminem starts with E, better check the spellin'
With a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped on my Adam's apple
Somebody dropped me on my head and I'm for sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was 6 months
And said I'm ready now bitch, ain't you feeling these kicks, cunt?
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you're sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
Hit you in the head with a brick till you plummet
If y'all don't like me you can suck my dick till you numb it
And all the gibberish you were spittin', you need to kill it
'Cause your style is like dying in my sleep, I don't feel it
And any MC that try to step to this I'll throw you right off of the roof
Ayo, bust it Proof!

[Verse 2: Proof]
One of a kind and I come with the time
Having fun with the rhyme until I'm done with your mind
Listen, now every MC got a story
Well mine is me and my story is an >< before me
I'm sorry >< the style to be proved
Ayo since Big Daddy Kane fell off they don't know how to be smooth
Yo, I seen a fat rodent walk in with Paul Rosen
With a gat in holding, talking 'bout he DeShaun Holton
It's the same thing, we bust when it come through
With Tim Westwood, your best foot forward
Can't do that, here it is, put your good foot
We mack y'all, like y'all was some hoes on Wood wood
No time for that, flatbacks when you rap, counterattack
With a battle axe, you collapse from them whack raps
You try to spit to me, I make you all know I'm a genius
A ><
Come back holding myyo, no need to cuss, bust (penis!)
Yo we can't say that keep it the cleanest, the meanest
Slim Shady, next thing it was my fault
Y'all caught outlined in chalk, incredible as the Hulk
While I settle for ><, it's the P-R-letter O
Sex is hetero, cash more checks than federal, you better know
How you feel about they got a dope cheddar flow
And my man Dee Teezy, straight from Stress magazine
Bag a scene, we drag your queen
Like she's a man dressed up, how you feel you get pressed up
Left up, it's time for that P-R-O-O, you get F'd up
Yeah it's time for that mind combat
Next up my man Slim Shade when we rhyme at

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Last night I OD'd on rush, mushrooms and dust
And rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
Shucks, I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I've called in to work cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol 3 and talk about how violent I'll be
Give me 11 Excedrin and my head will spin
Medicine will get me reving like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls till I shred the skin
Doctor check this rash, look how red it's been
It's probably AIDS, forget it then
I'll strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That don't even make sense like dykes using dildos
So reach in your bill folds for 10 duckets
And pick up the Slim Shady stuff that's on Rawkus
Some'n some'n some'n some'n, I can't read it
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it

[Verse 4: Proof]
Ayo, the truth hurt when Proof hurt
Move the whole Earth beneath your feet just like loose dirt
So F your politics if you swallow, feel the hollow tips rip
Through your collar disc, learn your knowledges
Then burn your colleges, I touch your grill
With the skill of a dermatologist, your turn to follow this
Acknowledge this head cracker, ho smacker
Whack rapper attacker, internet hacker
No slacker, best factor, Midwest bracket
Yeah you know about it, it's us on your jacket
DJ Headscratcher like a hatchet, who can match it?
Make you go-go like Gadget, perform magic
Without a wand, I drop bombs without Saddam
A vet' without 'Nam, I make sense without common ground
I'm still down y'all with my first crew
You got a fly style, I down that just like curfew
Yo I'm worth two ears and a mind full of attention
Plus I'm CEO of the whack MC prevention
Listen to the real gift over ill riffs
Cause you on the mic, me and Em aren't tryna hear like Will Smith
Your career's not over with, come here to cope a spit
We heat the sub y'all before the supernova hit
I know the truth, so now Im baring all
I make R. Kelly confess he stole his first style from Aaron Hall
A whack MC with a gun, I'm not one
And when see Kurt Cobain tell him "bring back my shotgun"
I got one style for all y'all bazooka
Ayo if I was 2Pac I'd come back from Cuba
Rhyme with me when I push on her tooters
Tryna get wild and then we bust like Lugers
Me and my man Slim Shady, we pen great-y
Take our 80 MC's, West you know what, what
What, what, what, what
What

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Yo yo yo
One more time I come back
Slinging the wack, yo
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Senior
And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a messed up childhood, that I use as an excuse
And ain't nothing changed, I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Pfft, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowing mine out
Forget it, you only live once you might as well die now

[Verse 6: Proof]
Yeah, best do like it is
Roll your tape recorders, we came to the London borders
Walk in a caster store, put on a master score
Blast your four, then I trash your store
Your woman start to scream so I stab your whore
Jet out your door faster than a Labrador
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 7: Eminem]
Smoking herb and still we spit
On this microphone, they say I'm allowed to say 'shit'
So I'ma say it as much as I can
Cause it don't matter cause I'm the man
With a fricking beer in my hand
I said frick cause I was respect to Tim Westwood
Y'all wanna step to this, yo I come from the best hood
Detroit, the Motown, where it goes down
Kick the flow sound, rappers they know now
But kick a pro now

[Verse 8: Proof]
Back and forth, me and Em don't need to practice
Y'all lack this, we stick you like a cactus
You scream like a actress, the fact is
Y'all can't see us in '99, 2000
3000, 4000 arousing styles

[Verse 9: Eminem]
And 3 plus, y'all wanna be us
But none of y'all can see us
Even if y'all had some new bifocals, I try locals
So y'all die >< cause I smoke you
Plus I provoke you and then I bust
Freestyles y'all can't trust, I'm like Canibus
I bust, can I bust? No you can't
Well yes I can cause I'm Slim Shady and I'm the man

[Verse 10: Proof]
We flex styles like a bicep
I found out where Canibus money went
I borrowed a dollar from Wyclef
Rhyme deaf MC's need to try this
You can't get with this, make you one of my
Plus that, we bust back, yo F that
Rap that, step up and get flat
And it's time for y'all to hear what this year's around
Detroit been quiet long enough
Yo Slim, I need you to back me up
My freestyles ain't connecting
They better start respecting

[Verse 11: Eminem]
Well I'ma check then with dirty needles
It's two of us but we're not the Beatles
Cause there was three of them, and I am seeing them
But yall ain't seeing Em even if I was driving in the BM in the PM
With the top up and the top down, don't matter cause I rock now
Yo y'all can hear the Glock sound, 2Pac now
Yo that's what I am when I bust, this lyrical image
Y'all can't just betray the scrimmage
That I be killing when I be busting and I'm crushing
Any MC leave em with no freaking discussion

[Verse 12: Proof]
Run up in your house then I shot your wife
Ayo Em, hold these Tylenol 3's while I rock the mic

[Verse 13: Eminem]
Weed lacer, ninty-seven burgundy blazer
Wanted for burgulary, had to ditch the mercury Tracer
I'm on some loc shit, some fed up with this being broke shit
I'm not to joke with, yo I don't sell crack, I smoke it

[Break]
Aight?
Blastin' off, aight?
We blastin' off right now, London!
Tim Westwood baby, you don't understand right now!
We bombing the whole land on some Vietnam shit yo!
Where we >< yo!

[Verse 14: Eminem]
Hand me an .8, beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world and spit on Brandy and Ma$e
I'm more than ill, scarier than a white person
Trapped in a room with Lauryn Hill, human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me
Cause I'ma still be Madd Rapper, whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddling, makin fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back-striking a Ford
And you wonder what the hell I need more Vicodin for
Everybody's pissing me off; even the No Limit Tank
Looks like a middle finger sideways flipping me off
No duh I'm a great danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in the grave and bury myself?
You can hate me now

[Verse 15: Proof]
Need to run for cover
Eminem is white but he still my brother
Slim Shady, known to go and smoke crack
But you and Charli Baltimore got something in common, you both whack
How you feel about that? No need to jock 'em
You so whack you make Master P sound like Rakim
When it's time to bust y'all, when we trust y'all, we dust y'all
Who y'all? Break your balls like cue balls
I know who you are, you RuPaul
Do stall, for those try to fall and try to brawl
All y'all get bust up and banged up, framed up
How many MC's bring my name up?
The same slut said the same thing, it's freestyle
No need to rehearse, my verse is universal
Curse a flow, crush you like Hershel Walker
Allie Sparker, three day sparker highland Parker chalker
You MCs can't get darker than the Midwest bracket
It's us, me and Emzee
Come right there, we feeling flimsy
Tipsed up, one time lifetime we ripped up
It's bad to the evil, met that, now it's all to say
Death rap, fuck hoes, don't even say get blast away, passed away
Blasted ass, hey yo, they say we're Aftermath
Slim Shady, you heard that, my words black
But bust you up because you preferred that
To hear me now, preferred that, the surgical snipe
Preserved you with life, I'll make you allergic to life
You die for this, don't even battle us
See us at thewhat's that?Subterreanean
We knock your brain in

[Outro]
Flows are hmm delly-lah like Arabian!
(Proof mimicking Arabian speech)
Ayo, ayo
We don't wanna hear that best white rapper, we be talking 'bout
Best rapper
Get all that out, you know what I'm sayin' ?
No doubt, never
Blastin' off
Explosions left and right(left and right)
This is legendary(Legendary)
Legendary!(Remember this show!)
This is John Lennon, this is John Lennon, legendary
Remember this show
History, baby
We on some John Lennon
Blowin', blowin'
We blowin' the spot right now London
Where it's war yo!
Blowin'!
It doesn't even matter
Slim Shady, Big Proof
Cmon Tim Westwood
We blowin' up the spot right now London!
London's done, it's gone!
What did ya think baby?
Thanks for having us Tim
No doubt, no doubt, we blowin' up the spot
We blastin' off with Tim Westwood now

Big up New York, big up Paris, big up London
Big up Jersey, big up Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Manhattan
Big up Tim Westwood
We makin' it happen yo!
Tim Westwood, where it's born!
Thank you everybody, have a good night's sleep



[Intro]
I can almost taste it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
I can almost see it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
I can almost taste it

[Spoken: Eminem]
Yeah, can't stop now
This might be the last chance I get to be famous
(I just wanna be famous)

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but...
Be careful what you wish for

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berserker than a fed-up post office worker
I murk her with a Mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster, you sure did shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel
How thangs turn around when his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out, that's what I call blowin' your mind
When I come back, like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack that you slept on, son
Now here I come, screaming "Attack!" like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem 'til he showed 'em defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit, his britches, he outgrowed 'em
He's so out cold, he's knocked out at the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him, rigor mortis and post mortem
He's dyin' of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em, then try to thwart him
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit-stained drawers, you gon' fuck with a guy
Who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce?
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think I'm backin' down?
You must be out of your dang skulls; I'm almost famous

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but...
Be careful what you wish for

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm back for revenge, I lost a battle, that ain't happenin' again
I'm at your throat like strep, I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are just stored in my memory
Some I wrote on a napkin; I do what I have to to win
Pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers?
And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the wacko
'Fore I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern and smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick! 'Dick''s too short of a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick!
Don't call me the Champ, call me the Space Shuttle Destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger; matter fact, I need a lawyer
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
Y'all are Eminem backwards: you're Mini Mes
See, he's in a whole nother weight class
He's slugs, you're BBs: you're bean-bag bullets
You're full of it, you were dissin' his CD's, laughed at Infinite
Now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D.R.E
He's almost famous

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but...
Be careful what you wish for

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now there he goes in Dre's studio, cuppin' his balls
Screamin' the wood off the panelin', cussin' the paint off the walls
Spewin' his hate to these haters, showin' no love for these broads
He ain't givin' them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
With the scars, 'til Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out, "Ahh!"
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked
Instead of suckin' him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine, they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it, he's fuckin' had it
He's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman, girl
The bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward, this whole spot blowin'
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?
And while I'm bein' poetic, let me get it stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
So bear witness to some biblical shit, there's a cold wind blowin'
This world ain't gonna know what hit it
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous



[Intro: Eminem]
(Kill, kill, kill)
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum... dum
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum, duh-da-da-da-da
(Kill, kill, kill)
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum... dum
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum, dumm
(Kill, kill, kill)

[Chorus: Eminem]
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I get lifted and spin 'til I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink, pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin 'til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash, whiskey, and ash 'til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
Mash with me again and imagine this

[Chorus: Eminem]
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

[Verse 2: Bizarre & Eminem]
I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was sleep
Pissy-drunk, throwin' up in the urinal
(You fuckin' homo!) That's what I said at my dad's funeral

[Hook: Eminem]
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

[Verse 3: Eminem]
That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin' idiots still
That's why the first motherfucker poppin' some shit, he gets killed
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville (Ville)
You can get capped after just havin' a cavity filled (Hahahaha!)
That's why we're crowned the murder capital still
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfuckin' Hamburger Hill
We don't do drive-bys, we park in front of houses and shoot
And when the police come we fuckin' shoot it out with 'em too
That's the mentality here, that's the reality here
Did I just hear somebody say they want to challenge me here?
While I'm holdin' a pistol with this many calibers here?
Plus a registration that just made this shit valid this year? (Yeah)
'Cause once I snap, I can't be held accountable for my actions
That's when accidents happen (Happen), when a thousand bullets come at your house
And collapse the foundation around you and they found you
And your family in it; goddammit, he meant it when he told you

[Chorus: Eminem]
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

[Outro: Eminem]
Dum, tahh-dum; ta-dah-da

[Produced by Mr. Walt of Da Beatminerz]

[Verse 1]
Hi! Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place, blowed, and sprayed Puffy with mace
I laced the weed with insect repellant, better check the smelly
Eminem starts with E, better check the spellin'
With a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my Adam's apple
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I'm for sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
And said "I'm ready now, bitch! Ain't you feelin' these kicks, cunt?"
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in Hell
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
Hit you in the head with a brick 'til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick 'til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it
Cause your style is like dying in my sleep; I don't feel it

[Hook]
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy  you hear me? Huh?
Is fuckin' crazy  hello, hi!
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy  do you hear me? Is fuckin' crazy

[Verse 2]
I'm ice-grillin' you, starin' you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed
Full of more uranium than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head
Spasmatic, strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flatlined, jumped up, and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai weed
Lookin' Chinese with my knees stuck together like Siamese
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins
It probably all depends on if I keep on killin' my girlfriends

[Hook]
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy  you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin' crazy  listen
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy  do you hear me? Is fuckin' crazy

[Verse 3]
Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic, and that's all I can say
I call in at work, cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH)
Give me eleven Excedrin, my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin' like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls 'til I shred the skin
"Doctor, check this rash! Look how red it's been!"
"It's probably AIDS!" "Forget it then."
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That don't even make sense, like dykes using dildos
So reach in your billfolds for ten ducats
And pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
"Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin', I get weeded."
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it

[Hook]
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy  you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin' crazy  hello?!
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy  do you hear me? Is fuckin' crazy

[Outro]
Hi, something's not right
I'm sorry, I'm mentally retarded
Slim Shady, I think that's my name
Rawkus Records, fuckin' crazy
Do you hear us? We're fuckin' crazy!
All of us! Hi bye goodnight, somethin'



All i got to do is throw any word at you, you can take any word and just rhyme wth it, i'm like..

Whatever
Technical

Technical? I had spectacles back in school, yo, you just expect a fool
If you try to clam with me, if you ain't down with me, and i ain't tryna have you around me

Traffic emergencies

Traffic emergencies, tragic emergencies, it's an urgency, it burns when i pee, i'm the illest MC, from the motherfreakin D, the 3-1-3

Misproduction

The misproduction, rappers get sucked up into suction, cause they suck when they called up the station tryna bust for 30 seconds, yo slim shady, i mate hit records

Discombobulatorboobulator

Discombobulatorboobulator, yo, i get your b**** inflated, like Pamela Leigh, she wants to sample a pee, from me, doesn't matter cause she f'd the camera...


....tremendo mind state

The mind state of the crime rate, will elevate, when i accelerate, i levitate, give me another word, don't let me say rhymes, that your mother heard...

... supercalafragilisticexpealidocious

Supercalafragilisticexpealidocious, i smacked women with a closed fist, yo, i punch 'em, right in the nose when i be scrunchin, at the function, at the family function, or at ya picnic, give this ick quick, i'm willing to say, D infront of it, but rappers they don't want none of it, cause any MC i'll put on this verbal punishment..

<<<< Other guy rapping >>>>

Other guy:
And what you do?

Em:
And we did it like Jim Brady; i rock

Yo, i'm lil' like that Kim lady, when i be steppin to this mic just like a M-80
I blowing up the spot and i can rock right off the top, rappers don't wanna believe that everything ima drop, that som's gonna be hot weather you like it or not, thought a cypher a spot, cause i'm nitrogen hot
Rappers wanna try to step, this way that i kept, it's rep up, any rapper that wanna test the step up, cause I come offa the top, or a ?ridden?, i'm ishing, i wanted the same the real way but I stray written, bustin, killin, crushin, well i'm flushin this rappers that are b** rushin, blood ones rushin
Coming outta ya brain rappers know that i'm the same, they don't wanna step to this, they don't wanna feel the pain
Like DMX "what? you gon think that he's gon step to this now? eurgh, yo, you don't think you wanna f*** with this now" yo

Everybody's left me (If I'm gonna leave you?)
Yes (Tell me, what's up with you?)
I'm sorry, I-I, you know?
She comes in, from work late
(Your girlfriend?)
She comes in at late last night, okay?
I don't know where she's at
All I know is that she's got these little, like
Red marks on her neck
I'm like "Are those hickeys?"
"No, these aren't hickeys" I'm like
"You've been fooling around, I can't have it you"
She's done this to me before
I wish you could just, help me, like
I don't know, I'm-I'm kinda horny
(Huh? I'm listening) I've got candles lit
(What?) Candles, I've got candles, and got
The music playing, like a-- Can you hear it?

Or like have sex with my girlfriend when she comes

You want me to kill myself, right here, on national TV?!
(National TV? What's (stuttering and laughing)

I don't understand, what are you-
You know, I'm just an english regular guy, I'm a white kid, okay?
I grow up, you know

If you're not gonna jack me off, you fucking slut
You can suck my dick, you fucking whore



[Intro: DJ Green Lantern & Eminem]
Fucker
Yeah
Oh shit, it's the evil genius
Green lantern
Yeah
Ayo, Em
Ha ha
What we call this shit right here?
The Invasion!
You have Part One, you got Part Two
Now it's
Part three
The final chapter mother fuckers
Armageddon, lets go

[Hook]
I got a riddle: what's little and talks big
With midget arms and creamy white fillin' in the middle
That will do anything to throw dirt on my name
If it means walkin' the whole Mediterranean
Is he an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no
His name's Raymond and oh, so sorry yo, Osorio
But that was a long time ago when I was just Joe Shmoe
Rappin' in Joe Blows basement I apologized for it befo', so
Either accept it or you don't and lets move on
If I've shown that I've grown and get the bone
Keep lickin' these nuts you industry mutts
Keep walkin' around sniffin' each others butts
Or should I say asses
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses

[Lloyd Banks]
Hold up hold up hold up
New York city man
It's the kid Lloyd Banks
And if you hearin' what I'm hearin' right now
You know this ain't no regular shit homie
This something special and we gotta bring this back
Green, come on
Countdown to

[Eminem]
Armageddon
Lets go

[Hook: Eminem]
I got a riddle what's little and talks big
With midget arms and creamy white fillin' in the middle
That will do anything to throw dirt on my name
If it means walkin' the whole Mediterranean
Is he an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no
His name's Raymond and oh, so sorry yo, Osorio
But that was a long time ago when I was just Joe Shmoe
Rappin' in Joe Blows basement I apologized for it befo', so
Either accept it or you don't and lets move on
If I've shown that I've grown and get the bone
Keep lickin' these nuts you industry mutts
Keep walkin' around sniffin' each others butts
Or should I say asses
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses

[Verse 1: Eminem]
The question I ask is
How can I explain this
How can I swing this in English language
If I switch to slang and turn man to mayn
Do I do it in vain or simply to entertain
Am I being real or am I being fake
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine
Or am I caught up in this hot water wody on my daughter
I told ya I love this culture don't let em' insult ya
I'm tell ya one more (a)gain this is the environment that I was brought up in
But every now and then I use my pen to get rid of some frustration
Or should I say or should I say shun
Is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism
Your face is numb your stunned your look is cold
Like that of a man of seventy some years old
And it only gets colder which Is why I understand
And can't be mad at a forty four year old fan
With a chip on his shoulder who only owns a half of a magazine
And the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again
Only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown
Papa can't stand me papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down
In his new chair that goes round and round
That he bought from new money in his bank account
That I get him every issue when the thang comes out
Sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
And let his black side arm wrestle his white side
Yell Apartheid loud enough that he might slide
He might find someone dumb enough who might ride
But ain't nobody over here buyin' two white guys disguised as pro black
There is no slack
Far heart for college grad. In a fitted hat and a hunch back
Standin' by the clearance coat rack
In some old slacks and tomorrows old throw backs
Yeah

[Outro: Eminem]
Shady in the place to be seen
And i got what it takes  to rock the mic right
Still not gonna cater these punks
Fuckin' cocksuckin' pussy lips haters dicks cunts



[Part I: Arose]

If I could rewind time like a tape
Inside a boombox, one day for every pill or Percocet that I ate
Cut down on the Valium, I'da heard everything
But death is turning so definitewait!
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you, Bean, didn't want you to know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say, my liver and kidneys aren't functioning
Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, I guess
It's arrivederci, same nurse, just heard say they're unplugging me
And it's your birthday, Jade, I'm missing your birthday
Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai
And sweeties, thank you for waiting to open gifts
But, girls, you can just open 'em
Dad ain't making it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff
I yell, but nothing comes out, I'm crying inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream, but it's not aloud
You put your arm around Momma to calm her, wow
I just thought about the aisle I'll never get to walk us down
Never see you graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?
I've got so much more to do
And, Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down, but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new for me for school
Doody, I'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded
So many thingstime, I'd give anything to rewind it
I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
That image burned in my brain of you on that table
Me falling across your body, not able to stand to save you
God, why did you take him?
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan?
Little ladies, be brave, take care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other
I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me
Just don't get sad when remembering
And, little bro, keep making me proud
You better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down
And when you're exchanging those sacred vows
Just know that if I could be there, I would
And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too
I actually learned a lot from you
You taught me what not to do
And, Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you
Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room
Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down
Girls, please don't get upset
I see them cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let
Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
With every second, each closer to death
But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow
Then a breath, machines go (*beep beep beep*)
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
I'm tryna rewind time like a tape
Find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake
From this dream, I need to re-find my inner strength
To remind me, even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape

[Part II: Castle Extended]

(I don't want it!)
I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
I'm hanging it up, fuck it!
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
I'm proud to be back
I'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse
With Recovery, Mathers LP2
Help propel me to victory laps
Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past
Consider them last four minutes as
The song I'da sang to my daughters
If I'da made it to the hospital less than 2 hours later, but I fought it
And came back like a boomerang on 'em
Now a new day is dawnin'
I'm up, Tuesday, it's mornin'now I know

Toilet flush



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped
To think that I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast
It was like I blinkedsold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous
Cause I was getting sick of this feelin'
Like I'm always under attack, man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really thinking: "If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him."
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many people ever give a shit
What I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin', put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawing more attention toward it
Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Atta-boy, they told me to slow down, and I just zoned out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
It's like telling Gwen Stefani she sold out
Cause I was tryin' to leave, no doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down in history
Think they know now, because everybody knows

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

[Interlude: Eminem]
Thanks for the support, asshole! *scratch*
Thanks for the support, asshole!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quit actin' salty! I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he round about
Dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, but goddamn, honky
That compliment's like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck is all this trash-talkin' about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell, but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
To take my beltword to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothin' else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare
So what if the insults are revoltin'?
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest
And a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto before they put bath salts
And all those water bottles in Colorado, so get lost, Waldo!
My soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin'
A black hole, and I'm swallowin' this track whole
Better pack toilet paper, but I'm taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac
In fact there they go tryin' to dip out the back-door retreatin'
Cause everybody knows

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Holy mackerel! I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed "ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin' magnets work?"
Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin' a joke, it's laughable
Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch, you just need a helmet
Cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind
Shorty, you're fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er
Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog
Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
Cause all of my spare time is spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
But sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father
And I push it farther
So, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent shouldn't have been a parent
I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents
And motherfuckin' Father Time
It ain't never gonna stop a pessimist
Who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half alive
Poured my half empty glass in a cup
Now my cup has runneth over
And I'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster
Im going back to what got me here
Yeah, cocky, and cant knock being rude off, so fear not, my dear
And dry up your teardrops, I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too
Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows



[Intro]
Wow, baby

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 1]
The way she moves, she's like a belly-dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams, I
Think someone's at the door but I don't think I'ma answer
Police saying "freeze" (oh!), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, "freeze"? Please, I'm a human being
I have needs! I'm not done, not till I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr. Officer, I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B, I sing song
It go ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Sike, I joke, I joke! I kid, I kid!
If I offend, I'm sorry! Please, please, forgive!
For I am Triumph, the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Jessica Simpson looks oh, so tempting
Nick, I ain't never seen an ass like that
Every time I see that show on MTV, my pee-pee goes
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 2]
Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying "freeze" (oh!), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, "freeze"? Geez, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped
Please do not remove me from this movie theater, please
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great, big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee-wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What do you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh
'Cause there's a puppet on my hand (hahaha!)

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year I'll say, "ass" and she'll make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 3]
The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
In that video, she sings, "Get out, you bozo
I need a new boyfriend!" Hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying "freeze" (oh!), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, "freeze"? My computers will be seized
And my keys to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word "pee-pee"
Pee, on the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit!
Sike, I joke, I joke! I kid, I kid!
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down!

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me, please?
I ain't never seen an ass like that
'Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Outro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Woo!
Fuck is wrong with you?
Ha!



[Chorus]
(I don't know) Yes, man
(Why this world keeps turning) As the world turns
('Round and 'round) We all experience things in life
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
Trials and tribulations
(I don't know) That we all must go through
(Why this world keeps turning) When someone wants to test us
('Round and 'round) When someone tries our patience
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)

[Verse 1]
I hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsidaz, baby, and we suin' the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Yo, they never should've booted me outta reform school (Uh-uh)
Deformed fool, takin' a shit in the warm pool
'Til they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said, "It wasn't me, I got a twin"
Oh my God, it's you, not again (Ahh)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
'Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll pass the test guessin'
And all the other kids said, "Eminem is a thizz head
He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is Phys Ed"
Maybe true, 'til I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she need a Slim Fast
(Who, me?) Yeah, bitch, you so big
You walked into Vic Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
(Well, I have never)
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
(Wait, wait, wait, wait)
I felt the evilness and started transformin' (Rrrahh)
It began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'
Grabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground (Come here, bitch)
And took her up to the highest divin' board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly-flop

[Chorus]
('Cause I don't know) As the world turns
(Why this world keeps turning) These are the days of our lives
('Round and 'round) These are the things that we must go through
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now) Day by day

[Verse 2]
We drive around in million-dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsidaz, and we suin' the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source (Yo)
Hypochondriac, hangin' out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy, fat, white-trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pail of garbage
It's almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park bitch
I met a slut and said, "What up? It's nice to meet ya" (Hi)
"I'd like to treat you to a Faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck
And I don't get paid 'til the first of next month (Sorry)
But if you'd care to join me, I was about to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed, no Phillies or no papers
Plus, I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So give me all your money and don't try nothin' funny
'Cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me"
I went to grab my gun, that's when her ass put it on me (Stop)
With an uppercut, hit me with a basket of laundry (Ooh)
I fell through the glass doors, started causin' a scene
Slid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine
Jumped up with a broken back, thank God I was smokin' crack
All day, and doped up on coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her, but yo, I gotta catch her first
Ran through Rally's parkin' lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room
That's when I seen her bedroom door shut
"I know you're in there, bitch, I got my gun cocked
You might as well come out now"
She said, "Come in, it's unlocked"
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked, watchin' gay porn
She said, "Come here, big boy, let's get acquainted"
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg, "No, please let go"
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just tryna buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
Duh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh, go-go gadget dick
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground, caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted, "Now, bitch, let's see who gets the best"
Stuffed that shit in, crooked and fucked that fat slut to death
Ow, ow (Come here, bitch)
Ow, ahh (Come here, take this mothafuckin' dick, bitch, come here)

[Chorus]
('Cause I don't know) And as we go along
(Why this world keeps turning) Throughout the days of our lives
('Round and 'round)
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
We all face small obstacles
(I don't know) And challenges everyday
(Why this world keeps turning) That we must go through
('Round and 'round) These are the things
That surround us through our atmosphere
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
(I don't know) Every day
(Why this world keeps turning) Every single day the world keeps turning
('Round and 'round) Keeps turning
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now) Keeps turning
(I don't know why this world keeps turning)



[Verse 1]
One thousand different houses and Mnchausen, I'ma make you
Wanna punch out some-fuckin'-one: "Ouch! What the fuck you hit me for?!"
Screamed life as I punch counter, in bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger in a dumb gown
Black hoodie with a scythe, shit, I laughed in his face, spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like, "Take this!
Now get your ass back in that game, bitch! Don't take shit
For granted, and don't take shit, give it!"
Only bull you should take is by the horns, a mixture of Whitey Ford
And Mighty Thor, I everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writin', then record, replenish, keep writin' more
Nothing's ridin' on it but your pride, that's all you're fightin' for
So you fight, scratch, you claw, backs to wall, no one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls like they're gargantuan and ask yourself how fuckin' bad you want it
Pull out your badge for whoopin' ass and flash it on 'em
Nobody's gonna back you in the corner, you're a hornet
No one's more ignorant than you fuckin' four in the mornin'
You're at the laboratory, stormin' like there's nothin' that's more important
Emcees, you better consider this a formal warnin', you're in for it!
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face?
I ain't finished, bitch, I meant "in half", oil the blades
Nobody wants to play, they say I'm a spoiled lil' baby, but

[Chorus]
Nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya

[Verse 2]
What goes through an addict's brain besides static pain
And Big Daddy Kane, breakbeats and words? An erratic train
Of thought like splatter paint, scatter brain
Yeah, maybe that explains why you're back but don't rap the same (Yeah!)
And you're lookin' way thinner 'cause your hunger got you lookin' like
They took away dinner (Chicka) "Sugar Ray" Leonard
Wouldn't sugar-coat a fuckin' booger though just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a (Chicka) what? (Chicka) GOAT
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips, hope it lands on
Another rap singer's lips who can't think of shit anything of wit
That's interesting to spit, yo, who's king of this fuckin' English lit?
Let your middle fingers flip on each hand while extendin' the shit
How low can you go? Lower then Chuck D, ho
Hear the bassiness in my voice? Rocky's back, where my Adrian's?
Nobody's crazy as Shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the Patriots
To rap; I'm not a man, I'm a weapon who just happened
To be a rapper who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany in the bathroom
I'd never be the same after now I'm back with an appe-
-tite for destruction and a fuckin' recipe for disaster
So let's eat 'cause I'm famished, every deed is a dastardly
One, evilest bastard, even you askin' for me to be po-
-lite to people's like me havin' my teeth pulled

[Chorus]
Nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya

[Verse 3]
So step inside a dimension demented side of a mind that's like
An inside of an engine while I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded: if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper you'll be the first one who finds him offensive
Got him climbin' the fences, lost some time to addiction
But look up "rhyme" in the dictio-nary, I'm in the picture
"Eminem" is the synonym for it, I'm an enigma
Fuck it, let's get to the meatballs, I'm gonna skip the
Veg and potatoes, edumacator (They are)
Shit, legends are made of, spit treacherous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretched is what you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
Then combine 'em with Method Man and Redman with metham-
-phetamines in each left hand, in each right is a sledgehammer
In pajamas, standin' in front of a webcam
Beatin' themselves in the head 'til Russell lets him off Def Jam
Maybe I need my head exam-ed, Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hangin' from his ceiling, drippin' with a bed pan
I need meds, swear to God 'cause if I go off the edge
T.I. ain't talkin' me off the ledge, man
Heart-throb that'll fart, ah, nah
More like a smart slob, part blob that'll stab you with a sharp ob-
-ject to the heart and leave claw marks all over the Wal-
-Mart walls, little baby with large balls
Fuck mud-slingin', I'm blood-flingin'
There's nothing on this fuckin' Earth better than bein' the
King of the playground, I hate the swings, but I love bein'
An underdog 'cause when I'm pushed I end up swingin' (Ah!)

[Chorus]
Nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya



[Intro: Police Scanner]
Attention all units, attention all units
We have an all-points bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back, fellas
He could be coming at your girlfriend next

[Verse 1]
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword, don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs, folks

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he aint no good!

[Verse 2]
We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Lockin' down every block and put up metal detectors
Protect yours and be sure that you stand close
Watch each other's backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he aint no good!

[Verse 3]
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and to beat him unmercifully
For what he first did to me, it's sure to be the last
Followin' footprints with a magnifyin' glass
To drag his lyin' ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of this tattle tail
I heard a yell, the voice sounded familiar
"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya!"

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he aint no good!

[Verse 4]
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezin' at dust, and swingin' at the spider webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint, in my mouth
Then the lights in the place went
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at, I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he aint no good!

[Verse 5]
Dealing with backstabbers, there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cuffed him at the scene, then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone

[Police Voice]
Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home
I repeat, he's going back to the crazy home
Job well done

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he aint no good!

[Verse 1]
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're
Right back on it, reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing?
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine
Well, I've never recovered
But tonight I bet you that what you're
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this."
Heart's saying, "I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset."

[Chorus: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

[Verse 2]
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone but he's not forgotten
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures
So long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin'
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And, gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh

[Chorus: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

[Verse 3]
I've been drivin' around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
Like I reached my full potential: I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat caught your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat
You can have that shit back cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in the car right now  wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's a sequel to my
Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!
Last album now, cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck
The best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God! Police! Aaaghh!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan, Stan!
Slim: "Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha, big bro, it's for you; Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again!

[Verse 4]
I also represent
Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approachin' its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standards you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, I told you so!
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packin' a wallop
So, one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryin' to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist
Tortured, trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up where the last Mathers left off



[Verse 1: Eminem]
We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Up back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth
Jump back in the studio, give you a tongue-lashing, then you
Laughed at the stomach tat with the tombstone
It was funny back in our youth
But then it wasnt after we knew
That we were done and actually through (And actually through)
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do
So many things different (Things different)
'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once and that I would use
To continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, Im confused
Because

[Chorus: X Ambassadors]
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You were the beat I loved with a writer's block
The line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we'd wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone for Mom to call
And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
Givin' it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed we were supposed to not
Every time we fought, the insults they got thrown too far
Words that we said that we didnt mean
The words that we meant that we didnt say
The ones that we thought that we shoulda said
Letters written that we coulda read
Which maybe woulda led to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lyin still if I said I wasn't sittin' here askin' myself

[Chorus: X Ambassadors, Hailie Jade & Eminem]
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (You said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But theres always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

[Verse 3: Eminem]
We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you, but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry, Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leavin' you was fuckin' harder than
Sawing off a fuckin' body limb
Once upon a time we're all we had
Maybe that's what drew us
To each other, it was true love
Shit, we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what
We did to each other, all the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was
More in love with me
And I was thinkin' I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
'Til we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
If I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard "Mockingbird"
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
I've caused a few and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was
Partly yours, partly mine, but really no one's
This is so tough, I'm gettin' choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, backstabbed each other
Another blow struck, but there's no duckin' this blow
'Cause it's over and it's closure
But I'm not so sure how to close this
I just don't know how some people can be so good
At one thing and so fucked at a whole nother
Shit, it's no wonder

[Chorus: X Ambassadors, Hailie Jade, Eminem]
How come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (You said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband



[Chorus]
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just let it go!)

[Verse 1]
Hand me an eighth, beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world, and shit on Brandy and Mase
I'm more than ill, scarier than a white journalist
In a room with Lauryn Hill human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot and people'll feel me
'Cause I'ma still be The Mad Rapper whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddling, making fun of your yacht
But I would like an award for the best rapper to get
One mic in The Source and a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back strikin' at Ford
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicodin for?
Everybody's pissin' me off: even the No Limit Tank
Looks like a middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No shit, I'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself?

[Chorus]
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just let it go!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just do it!)

[Verse 2]
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin' corners
Lookin' for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin' James Todd Senior
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed ninth grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death, as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge, and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowin' mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now

[Chorus]
(Just let it go!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just do it!)

[Verse 3]
My laser disc'll make you take a razor to your wrist
Make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains are rippin' out your skull
So bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a role model, I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailie Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gilbert's paid to make me dishwash?
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than eighty Kim Scotts
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I knew that "Just the Two of Us" would make you hate me this much
And "Just the Two of Us," that ain't got shit to do with us
And our personal life, it's just words on a mic
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch!

[Chorus]
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just let it go!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just do it!)

[Intro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)]
I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
20 years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em
Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold-blood
That old saloon there was their little home away from home
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
And on a quiet night, you can still hear
The footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da 5'9"

[Verse 1: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
I don't speak, I float in the air, wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And the noise is spread
Picked up and transmitted through Royce's head (Uhh)
Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed
'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead (Ohh)
I asked him to come to the dark side
He made a choice and said (Yo)
Who hard? Yo, I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity
Holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the Devil, intelligence level
Is hellier than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist
Interceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life, when the black knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation
Collaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth

[Chorus: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
We hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the law 'cause I don't agree with police either
Shit, me neither

[Verse 2: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle (Ahh)
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up
And I'm pissed off, 'cause I can't find a decent vein
The disaster with dreads, I'm bad enough to commit suicide
And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
'Cause I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred, man, until they joint chains
While slippin' bullets at point-blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws
With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazin' emcees, at the same time amazin' emcees
Somehow, emcees ain't that eyebrow-raisin' to me
From all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough
To cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt

[Interlude: Eminem]
Hello? (Billy?)
Ayo, whats up? (We're comin' to get you)
Stop, they know it's us

[Verse 3: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (Uh-uh)
I'm the one who burned your house down (Oh)
Well, I'm out now (Shit)
And this time, I'm comin' back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon' leave you with a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9" & Eminem]
'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Against peaceful, see you in Hell for the sequel
(We'll be waiting) See you in Hell (Uh-huh)
Wall Street (Yup), Royce Da 5'9", Slim Shady (Uh)
See you in Hell for the sequel (Bye-bye)
Bad Meets Evil, what? (Until next time)

[Outro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)]
And so, that's the story of when Bad meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back comin' out of that old saloon
But their spirits still live on 'til this day
Shh, wait, did y'all hear that?



[Produced by Dr. Seuss]

[Eminem]
Arsonist, blocking a fire hose where the nozzle is
Go to hospitals, steal the blood that tests positive
Take it home, pour it in a cup and drink lots of it
Trying on your mother's clothes, trying to get these bras to fit
When she comes home, I'm waiting in the closet, with
A knife, hiding so quiet she'll probably hear the faucet drip
All my life I've been a foster kid
So if I die an early death suicide's gon' be the cause of it

[Royce Da 5'9]
Who hard? yo I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the devil
Intelligence level is hell-ier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist
Intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse
Then one get at you, dash you in the back of a Chevrolet
Spittin shit at you faster than your eardrum could ever play

[Eminem]
Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the Law cuz I don't agree wit police either (shit, me neither)

[Eminem]
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me wit the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off
Cuz I can't find a decent vein

[Royce Da 5'9]
The disaster wit dreds
I'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
To kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
Cuz I serve any stranger wit money
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
While slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches
I got a lot of evil; I got knowledge peeking out of my cerebral now that I got people locked and rock evil
While still on the beat, I hit you in your ribs so hard to think its just a touch to the floor, while your still on your feet
I'm blazin MC's, at the same time amazin MC's Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me
Destroying the track, un-employing the whack, exploring the facts while my man Eminem is withdrawing from crack

[Girl voice crying]
I just love him..
I just love him..

[Royce Da 5'9]
Who hard? yo I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the devil
Intelligence level is hell-ier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist
Intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse
Then one get at you, dash you in the back of a Chevrolet
Spittin shit at you faster than your eardrum could ever play

[Eminem]
Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the Law cuz I don't agree wit police either (shit, me neither)

[Eminem]
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me wit the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off
Cuz I can't find a decent vain

[Royce Da 5'9]
The disaster wit dreds
I'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
To kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
Cuz I serve any stranger wit money
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
While slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches



[Intro]
Oh, it's music to my ears, oh man
How can I describe the way I feel?
Fucking great, man
Okay, let me see
How could I begin?

[Verse 1]
Locked in Mariah's wine cellar, all I had for lunch
Was bread, wine, more bread, wine and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up, an in-between snack, crackers to munch
Mariah, what ever happened to us?
Why did we have to break up?
All I asked for was a glass of punch
You see, I never really asked for much
I can't imagine what's going through your mind after such
A nasty break-up with that Latin hunk
Luis Miguel, Nick Cannon better back the fuck up
I'm not playin', I want her back, you punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread, Satin Funk
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rap and punk
Zapp and Eric Clapton, Shaft, Frank Zappa, crunk
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want
I mean, I really want you bad, you cunt
Nick, you had your fun, I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man, I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture

[Chorus]
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete's sake, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad

[Verse 2]
You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I'm the Miracle Whip trickster
My signature sound, when a tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow
Man, what an ensemble
What an assortment of pharmaceuticals
This beautiful pill dust in my palm, my
Cuticles get residue just from touchin' the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma
I'll cut ya like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword, boy, I'm like the fuckin' Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowing ya, Norman
You're so fuckin' annoyin', drop the shovel, boy
You don't know what the fuck you're doin'
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon, you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin' whore
Every minute there's a sucker born, snuck up on Malachai
Made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck o', shuck o' corn, Chaka Khan
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck, and
Told him it's fuckin' on, man, what the fuck are ya doin'?
You're runnin' over the snowblower with the lawnmower
Blowin' your bagpipes from Baghdad

[Chorus]
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete's sake, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag

[Verse 3]
In the bed with two brain-dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molestin' you
Titty-fuckin' you 'til your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
Is what I said to the two conjoined twins
How's it going, girlfriends? You needs a boyfriend?
You need some ointment? Just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first? We'll do a coin flip
I just got my one-year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get?
Baby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
And attempt to separate 'em and stitch 'em back at the loin, shit
Lure the little boy with the chocolate 'Chips Ahoy!' chip
Cookie, lookie, even took me a Polaroid pic

[Chorus]
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete's sake, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman
Holding a Glad bag, oh, bagpipes from Baghdad

[Outro]
Hghum-day-li-laaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aa-aah-aah
Hghum-day-li-laaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aa-aah-aah
Hghum-day-li-laaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aa-aah-aah
Hghum-day-li-laaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aa-aah-aah

Hit the doors on that Phantom, man, that shit looks like the Batmobile

Custom-fitted, custom-kitted wood grain
Custom everything, what's that on the seat, custom mustard stain

Hit the corner liquor store to get Corona, tip the owners
Sipped it on the way out as I dipped, I wanna rip the road up
And I'mma hit the cinema and I'mma get the hoes
When I be at a theater shit, anything goes
I'm ballin' outta control, girls know I'm loaded with dough
But shit, I'm stingy as fuck, I'm fuckin' stingy as hoes

You fuckin' keyed up my Benz bitch, I beat up my friends
Don't think I won't beat a bitch, I'll kick a six-year-old in the ribs
You fuckin' retard, I'll have you suckin' farts out my seat
I'll teach you not to know how to control your bowels when you eat
What the fuck do you think that colostomy bag is for, looks?
I ain't waste nine bullets on you for you to not sing no hooks
I fuckin' take a Make a Wish Foundation patient with me
How 'bout some coke inside of your saline solution IV
Turn around and use it on me, you tryna snort all my keys
You fuckin' brat, get in back, you're comin' to Florida with me

Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably ba-ba-ba controllably
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably ba-ballin' uncontrollably

[Outro]
Tracy, I joined this class cuz I thought Id be cooking with a partner
But shes never here, and I dont get twice the credit for all the work

I didn't invent odd numbers Seth

I know, but Im over here in my unit, every day, cooking my terrible-tasting food, and then I gotta look over at Evan, I mean look at him, it looks like the most fun Ive ever seen in my entire life. And, Im just saying, I wash and dry, Im like a single mother. And, no offense but, everyone takes this class to get an A and its bullshit, but uh no offense, Im just saying. And Im not putting down your profession, but when am I gonna need to cook tiramisu? Am I gonna be a chef? No. Theres 3 weeks left in school, give me a freaking break, sorry for cursing. OH MY GOD thats like the coolest fucking story Ive ever heard in my life, its insane. Can you tell us again? Do you have time? Tracy, Tracy, can you hear me? Im in the car right now. Listen, I am McLovin, yeah. McLovin in the house! McLovin in the house! Yeah



Bust it
The final problem is solved by throwin' sulfuric acid all over your back to see your spinal column dissolve
Droppin' bodies like it was domino season
My phenomenal legion will shoot out
Your fuckin' abdominal region
Slim Shady, responsible for your permanent stillness
Just escaped from the hospital with terminal illness
Itchin' to rip your fuckin' frame out
Cuz I ain't got nothing to lose
Like that movie that just came out
Callin' your name out, first, last and your middle initial
Your mom, your dad, and your pregnant widow will miss you
And anybody else poppin' some shit'll go witchu
Cuz I ain't tryna hear it like a political issue
So until I can leave with enough funds
I'mma shove guns up in the mouths of your loved ones
Drown 'em face down in the bath while the tub runs
Got a rap sheet that's longer than Tubby's sub buns


And I'mma kill it, just so y'all think
That I can't come of the top
And I be forced to rock unorthodox styles
From off the top of the dome
With a popular poem, forget a damn team
I can stop you alone
Rapper's thinking they putting out
They records cause they sell
But that can't fuck with what me, we doing here with AL
Y'all don't wanna do it, when we kick it
When we kick the fluid
Rappers don't wanna get into it, Y'all knew it
Cause the feds want me, they headhunt me, I'm Ted Bundy
I ain't dead, I just fled country
Said bluntly, a cannibal, animal, fed monthly
Eating bread crunchy, cement bed's comfy
Head's lumpy, funky like a dead skunk be
Med flunkie, jump off cliffs with thread bungee
Wearing red undees and a black cape
Rollin' through the hood cracked out
Bumpin' your whack tape
I'm coming through dumpin'
Change your rap name to Richard Jewell
Cause you ain't blowing up nothing
I'm showing up puffin', throwing up drinkin'
Killing brain cells till I'm slowing up thinking
Growing up stinkin', born with bad odor
Gimme Hennessey but please don't add soda
Now who's doper? You couldn't beat me when I'm sober
I'm off my fuckin' rocker like your Grandma tipping over
Slim Shady


"Son, where you from son?"
"Yo, I'm from Detroit city"
"Uh huh"
"I'm bout to do a little something like this
A little something like this."
"Ok, drop that shit."
"Bust it, bust it"

Yo, I hang with a bunch of hippies
And wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsidaz baby, and we suin' the courts
Cause we dope as fuck and only get a two in the Source
Yo, they never shoulda booted me outta reform school
Deformed fool, taking a shit in a warm pool
Till they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin
(Oh my God, it's you! Not again!)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
Cause I murdered my guinea pig
And stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the forty ouncers
Slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Forget the next lesson, I'll pass the test guessin'
And all the other kids said "Eminem is a thizz head
He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is phys-ed"
Maybe true, 'til I told this girl in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps she need a Slim Fast
(Who? Me?) Yeah, girl you so big
You stepped, walked into Vic Tanny's
And stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin'
It began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'
Picked that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground
And threw her up to the highest
Diving board to toss her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this girl face down and watch her belly flop, cause it's like that
And I come in and I start wildin' and shit
Then I be busting a lyric
And rappers don't believe I'm freestyling it
Well here it goes when I'm kicking lyrical flows
From your head to your toes
So that every rapper in this place knows
Cause when it comes to the freestyle
Coming off of the top of the dome
I'm knocking your mouth and ya off, so who you copying off?
Stop being soft, I'm standing on top of your loft
Killing you off slowly, like Roberta Flack
I've never heard of wack
MCs that try to step to me, I'll break your verta-back
Or vertebrae, increase the murder rates
In 79 states... Yo, check it
I'm bout to pass the mic to the next
MC who wanna step up and flex
With the techs, but make sure your shit is fresh
Come on, wreck it, who wanna be next?


It goes like this:
Broke the rubber, busted a nut up in your mother
So how do you feel about having another little brother
Nasty motherfucker, talking trash like a trucker
Snatch your bitch up out your track
I'll smack her up and fucked her
Always talk shit high, smoking chocolate Thai
So y'all can die, just for walking by giving an awkward eye
I've lost my motherfucking marbles
Smelling like a brewery
Droolin' at the way your jewelery sparkles
Head full of charcoal, smoked out brain particles
Burning holes in clothes articles
A retarded fool since I started school
Burned the weed before I learned to read, disregarded rules
Skip the classes to blaze the blunt ashes
Kissing front dashes from smashing up
Cars like stunt crashes
Hall passes for restrooms, chewing mushrooms
Doing rush fumes in the lunch room
Looking nervous, liquor in my thermos
Hung with hermits that carry guns without permits
Staring at the bitch with firm tits
Jacking off, aiming straight for both lips when my sperm spits


Set it off
Rappers get beheaded if they soft
Yo they get they wires crossed
Rappers try to step to me but I'm so ill I'll fire your boss
And this is all freestyle, killing it
While I'm filling it with adrenaline, rappers be feeling it
Like it was braille, so y'all can touch me anywhere
Cause I want you to feel me,
Rappers wanna kill me, but they don't thrill me
So check it, I'm bout to wreck when I make the record
Cause I'm, skinny like an anorexic girl headed for the exit
Running butt naked away from just being date raped
Rappers? I twist 'em into a great shape
And throw 'em in the Great Lakes
'Cause I'm from the Michigan state
For fishermans' sake, I throw 'em and toss 'em in
Rappers try to step to me
But this is the Holocaust and you'll never win
Cause I've forever been bent, forever demented
Rappers try to step to me but their shit is sweet-scented
And I'm demented, and if I said it I meant it
Killin' any MC cause I'm Infinite, and when it
Comes to the way that I'm spittin' lyrical infinite ammunition
And putting a clip in this lyrical track that I just be rippin'
Crushing it, killing it, taking your best line and hushing it
Taking your shit and flushing it down the toilet
Taking your biggest plot and foil it
Rappers can't uncoil it, I'll take my shit and aluminum foil it
Then throw it in the microwave and watch burn up
'Cause I'mma blow up
Rappers? I make 'em ill enough to throw up
Don't show up if you come to the battle


"Can I speed it up? Just a little bit?
Alright that's cool. Alright
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
This one for Quest."

Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit changed
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Came late to the last show with a different dame
Brain ate from the last O' that I sniffed of 'caine
You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turning to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
Burn you alive till you screaming to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science
Motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 bursting
You getting spun backwards
Like every word of obscene cursing
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stopping your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery
To try to stop the blood from your
Ruptured sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in the hospital and snatch you out your mother's frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
Cock block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit
And do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'mma no a head-butt so hard, I knock us both out
No doubt



[Intro]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1]
I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, "Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!"
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 3]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
"Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that."
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Bridge]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Outro]
Yeah, to my babies: stay strong
Daddy'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world: God gave you them shoes to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em, be yourself, man
Be proud of who you are, even if it sounds corny
Never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful



[Intro: Eminem and Sia]
I can feel the heat risin'
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder
Of why we can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, cause

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yesterday was the tornado warning, today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake in its wake to start the
Mourning process, and rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass, uh
Thunderstorm has passed ya, you weathered it
And poked its eye out with the thorn bush that you used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is
Stuffed, so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner faster, more assertive, never looking back
May hit the curb, but every day is a new learning curve as you
Steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve, but you have to
To avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket but you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past standing at inferno and chant

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive, which means you will survive
Although today you may weep cause you're weak
And everything seems so bleak and hopeless, the light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in; that's the only thing keepin'
You from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing and by tomorrow
You may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em
Even after all the shit you been put through, this feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in, but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin', you look down
Cause you're so over 'em you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

[Bridge: Eminem]
As time passes, things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal, but scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow, today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even
Perspire from the heat, exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief it's like watching the walls
Melt in your prison cell, but you've extinguished this livin' hell
Still, a little piece of you dies as you scream

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Bridge: Sia]
I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I have learned from fighting fights that weren't mine
It's not with fists, but with wings that I will fly

[Hook: Sia]
And I'm standin' in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light



Intro:
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, then I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1]
I'm just so (Intro echos) depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick that mic back up
I don't know how or when
And I ended up in this position I'm in
I starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and tried to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips
With the fact that
I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
I know some spits so hard to swallow
And I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
Copy
One tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you have to walk a thousand miles

[Pre-Chorus 1]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's be like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what I'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at it through each other's eyes

[Chorus 1]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, o-o-o-o-h
They can all get..... Just stay true to you, so-o-o-o-oh
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, o-o-o-o-h
They can all get..... Just stay true to you, so-o-o-o-oh

[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything is so tense and gloom I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature at a room
Just as soon
As I walk in
It's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that then it opens a door to conversation, like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention
I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no... manservant
Follow me around, and wipe my (instrumental)
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny like
Haah Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian
G--damn
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't have to trade our shoes
And you don't have to walk no thousand miles

[Pre-Chorus 2]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's be like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what I'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at it through each other's eyes

[Chorus 2]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, o-o-o-o-h
They can all get..... Just stay true to you, so-o-o-o-oh
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, o-o-o-o-h
They can all get..... Just stay true to you, so-o-o-o-oh

Outro:
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, then I'm reaching out for you



[Verse 1]
And I started from the bottom
Like a snowmanground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah)
'Nother day in the life (Uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shittick, tick, tickno remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WICwick, wick, wickwith a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah)
Or you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 3]
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you "Proof" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and mo
tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are two-faced didn't show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Do you still believe?



[Eminem]
Yo, guys! Do you know what is this:
It is old and ugly as fuck
It looks like mutant froggy duck
He's a prick, he's a cunt
And he never smoked blunt!

[Kuniva]
Maybe Michael Jackson, hahahah...

[Eminem]
No...

[Proof]
I know, that dude is Nelson Mandela!

[Eminem]
No, guys! It is Benzino!

[Everybody]
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA...



[Verse 1]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, "Stick it!"
So sick, I'm looking palewait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Chorus 1]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah

[Verse 2]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho

[Pre-Chorus]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Chorus 2]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berzerk, get your vinyls!

[Scratch]

[Verse 3]
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yowe done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick? (Word, man, you heard)
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

[Pre-Chorus]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Chorus 1]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah



Music.

I had met Paul, Em's manager, a few years ago and we always talked about the possibility of getting together to work on something at some point down the road. We just worked out it was meant to be at this time. I think it's unlike any current hip hop songs. If you listen to what's going on in hip hop, this is not what this is. Em wanted to do something kind of throwback to some of the early records that we were making in the old days. And it more reflects that energy of the early days of hip hop.

We were in the studio working on a bunch of different ideas and this was one of the later ones to come up. It started with a sample and the sample that we started with ended up not being in the record. The song sort of evolves. It started one way, it kind of got programmed and written to and then it changed into a whole different song.

And I felt the track was really strong and didn't really know what direction Em was gonna go in vocally. And then when I heard the vocals, that was pretty, exciting because it was not at all what I was expecting. And just the energy in it and the lyrics and the style of it. It's so well done and so smart and so funny. It's just great. In this song, we ended up using a wired guitar and hook and everything else pretty much is programmed.

It reminds me of old hip hop videos and I think it's really entertaining and I look forward to see it all put together and done. But in the shooting stages, the pieces I've seen look really entertaining.



[Intro: Eminem]
Welcome to Detroit
This is the BET, Shady 2.0 Cypher 2011
Myself, Slaughterhouse, and Yelawolf
White Dawg, get 'em!
(Thank you, cracker king!)

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Put these mothafuckas in a box, then I send 'em away
Put 'em in a gray 'llac and pop the trunk
And throw 'em in the back, jack; ha, dig 'em a grave
Put a brick inside that Xerox when I print up a page
Movin' keys I can relate, 'cause I live in the cage
I throw up the A, I take 'em to school, I give 'em a grade
An easy E for effort; that's WWA
White with an attitude, alphabet soup is on my plate
All I got is Z's, they sleepin' on me, I can't get 'em awake
I spoon-feed 'em a sound in a room full of deceivers and clowns
Who believe in makin' it rain 'cause all they see is the clouds
And I watch from the couch of the VIP like a potato
With a bunch of meatheads like, "Fuck it, I'll just feed 'em a cow."
Plenty of white boys to pick from this year
But before you pick a pepper, you better pick up your heater
'Cause even Peter Piper could pick up a mic
But what it's like to pick a fight with me
Is like puttin' Nikes on a cheetah
Better speed up, or at least in my case Adidas
I'm out this bitch, drinkin' Sprite by the two-liter
Holler! Shady Records

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Say I'm from the new school
I'ma say, "Check your tone and watch your mouth!"
If they teachin' how to Dougie, I'm condonin' droppin' out
Forced to wild, y'all birthed me, then gave me up
I just perfected being hip-hop's foster child; now check it
Don't blame y'all for being trash, fans are coppin' it
The radio's the crime scene, the masses are the hostages
In my youth I'd throw shots, the fad was dodgin' it
I'm grown, I ain't watchin' the throne, I'm sabotagin' it
You see that four-headed monster in the storm looms?
Snipe 'em from a distance; the scope got a long zoom
You Super Mario thugs is in the wrong room
Gotta figure here you won't get bigger if you on shrooms
If it was left to me, I'd revive what the game be 'bout
I'd have took the wine outta Amy house
Enough raps from you scrub cats 'bout cockin' a snub back
Wayne couldn't teach me how to love that
But I got this chick from uptown, she my summer bunny
Both parents broke, but she come from money
Think my bread is her paper to burn
So I lock her out, and now she doubt David is Stern
She's so bad, I make her hit the telly from a taxi
Then dead her in the Holiday Inn, learned that from Max B
That's why the haters envy, kinda wanna send me llamas
I made it right before their eyes, like I was Benihanas
Is it me, or is what I'm hearing just pitiful?
Airwaves the same, now the stereo's typical
My skin's thick, so the critics ignored
So unafraid to die you'd think I did it before
The boy's Rodman with the trash talk
Magic or Walt with the black ball
Way I bounce off the asphalt with cat paws, glass jaw
Hood of your mask will be the Blackfoot with no passport
Body be found in a mansion in one of my trapdoors
If punks had award you status whores categore
Probably be that of awards
Between Michael Rappaport and Kenny Lattimore
I know hip-hop's alive and well
If it died, you other crews wouldn't survive the smell

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
I spot a victim, the plot'll thicken when the clock is tickin'
I caught him slippin', I gotta give him a shot, I hit him
With proper spittin', hottest writtens and compositions
So competition's a contradiction
Somebody mention they got a Crooked, highly fiction
We probly different, got Gotti henchmen
Opposition, I'll body quick as Bugatti engines
I'm on a mission to get richer, the sickest lyric-kicker
Diggin' a ditch for different spitters
Weak lyricists get disfigured
Sip liquor, spit like a sick mixture
Of Notorious, Pun and L; get the big picture?
The poster, I'll roast ya
My mind so deadly it's just like the beanie is close to a holster
It's over, control my whole coastal region
Like I'm supposed to, flow is goin' postal even
Open season, heart close to freezin'
Ruthless as Eazy, nigga, approach, I'm squeezin'
Believe me, dopest West-Coaster breathin'
So most y'all hope I'm vegan; nope, I'm beefin'
Rappers need to keep it trill, give me a beat to kill
Too many people still eatin' sleeping pills
People sleepin' on my ether skills
And y'all ain't even real, you 'bout to die in this cypher
Before you die you should do the Jada and leave a will, for real

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
I ain't a rap dude, I'm a dude who rap
Before this I was movin' crack
Killers y'all become when y'all rhyme, I salute and dap
And if I blink, they'll remove your snaps
You ain't cool, you wack, with your foolish act
Skinny jeans don't mean your ass shoot
It means your booty claps
Don't play like Tyler Perry
This the Slaughterhouse of pain, flow brown, tight and heavy
When it come to 16's, I'm a fiend
Seen in the studio near a needle with a mean lean
Probably writin' bars to Nas' "Thief's Theme"
Gettin' my Yaowa on
Man, all these Olajuwons, we the dream team
This is an all day slaughter
They fiendin' for us to break, like Beyonce's water
The four quarters doin' all the eatin'
And y'all gotta know why I made the cut, I'm Puerto Rican
Ortiz keep the fire ready; and tryin' to put me out
Is like tryin' to steal a transvestite from Eddie

[Verse 5: Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm do-or-die dope, and you can make the sticker sittin' on the door of that Phantom your suicide note
Hi, Rihanna! Is Nicki livin' with you?
Let me know so I can buy binoculars and telescopes
Hi, Rihanna! I don't need to know you better
You tell me you love my music again, we go together
Bye, Rihanna! Now back to y'all fools
We rock out, like the outside of a guitar school
Thousand dollar frames I prefer to see the world through
Don't ask me nothin' about Budden, I beat my girl too
You ask me why do I keep her, I say it's cheaper to
That's why I ride around in a Rolls, like Wiz Khalifa do
Rappers, I'm your daddy, I tell you straight as this
You don't kill, but your father will, like Jayden Smith
I tell you like I tell my Spanish chick
You fly, but I ain't going down on no landin' strip
So get your wax on, like Daniel San, or I'ma have to run
Like De la Hoya in drag when cameras come
Point out the greatest rapper alive, I'll headshot him
Smack his girl on the butt and buy her some red bottom
Bring every deceased rapper back to see his wife
While I'm cyber-sexin' with Jessica Alba via Skype
Im on my D-boy, Deebo thing
Spiritual steelo swing, like Cee-Lo Green
Get out the camera with your B-Roll bling
You know your flow is wack
We cornered the market, like a Wal-Mart in a cul-de-sac
Yeah, this is what two million singles sold
And an album that's gold
Look like without having to sell your soul
Nickel!

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Ayo, lyrical miracle, spiritual individual, criminal
Subliminal in your swimming pool (Boooooo!)
You're 'bout to see peace destroyed, it'll never be restored
When I unleash these beastly hordes on your CD stores
Wanna stop it? You gon' need a priest, at least three swords
A license to ill from the Beastie Boys
Three Ouija boards, and a squeegee, and please be warned
Don't ask what the squeegee's for
Or the holy water, acid raps that'll eat these floors
Eat a hole in a rhyme book, you see these horns?
And as for me, you ask when I'm gone, will he be mourned?
Is puke lukewarm? Should Casey Anthony do porn?
Can that chick fit a newborn dead baby inside a frickin' shoebox with a shoehorn
Smothered in chloroform, so she can go get her groove on?
Can she duct-tape and Velcro a fetus?
Joell, yo, tell Joe I need his
Empty box from his old shell-toed Adidas
So I can put these babies in a fetal position
They're gettin' elbows to the penis
Yeah, big deal, I took some little kid's Big Wheel
And spit in his frickin' big kids meal
Quit tryna bite me and pinch, you wench, sit still!
Did you just put your six-inch heel
Through my Benz windshield?!
Is it dust we 'bout to kick up?
Can Yelawolf fit a fifth of rum in a big cup
Between his stick shift in his frigging pickup
And drink like a hick redneck hillbilly will 'til he gets hicc-ups?
Flippin' the script up, like Mike Vick
Gettin' bit in his junk by a Pit, yup, I'm a sick pup
I'd be a horrible magician, 'cause I'd fuck a trick up
Fix your lips up to say somethin' fly, or zip up!
Aye, B, let's see: you said you were gonna do X-Y-Z
'Til you fuck around and get dropped
Like an E when you add an I-N-G
Don't put a K in front of that, though, when I MC
'Cause I'm not the king of this microphone booth
It's more like a phone booth
Superman in this bitch, Kryptonite won't do
It gives me more power
I bump the Fat Boys and eat rat poison, take meteor showers
Fresh outta the mental hospital
And me not flossin' a middle finger while I hop in a mosh pit
Will be like Nas doin' gospel or R&Byou crazy?
Me pushin' up daisies, that thought is impossible
As if flashin' across the news
Posdnuos was caught with a prostitute
With a huge johnson, boobs and a monstrous tube
Of lube, and a bra, some boots
Some panties, and an aqua blue Mazda
Swallowin' a popsicle, playin' tonsil pool
So kill the rumors, it aint happenin'; Ima rap 'til I'm fossil fuel



[Intro]
I don't understand
Why are you being so mean?
You're a mean, mean man

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 1]
Alright, listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes, close 'em
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes, we are going to explore
Into your mind to find out why you're so fucking jealous
Now why did they make yoo-hoo? Pippity-kaka-poo-poo
Psych, I'm kidding, I just wanted to see if you're still listening
Okay, now I need your undivided attention
Sir, I have a question, why do I always sense this undeniable tension?
From the moment that I enter into the room it gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itching at me, is it just because...

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 2]
Alright now I (Shit), I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again, you idiot, no, I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me is that I fucked up, ain't it?
But I can bust one take without looking at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, okay? You're drooling, you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting, what the fuck you eat for lunch?
A bunch of sweets or something? What, you munch a bunch of Crunch 'n Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum, your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
"Yes, I do, sir, what am I on?" You, sir, are on truth serum
"Marshall, I'm so jealous of you, please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying all these terrible
Evil and awful mean things, it's my own insecurities"

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 3]
Alright, now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, wanna check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sunglasses on, now look in this mirror
How 'bout now? What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind, dying, there's no denying
That my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why are you even doing this to yourself? It's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this? This is torturous
My point is this
That if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just as...

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Outro]
Fuck off my dick



[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
Yeah, what up, Detroit?
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh, no, he didn't
They didn't do it again (What-what, you what?)
You shitted on these niggas two times, Dr. Dre?
Oh, fo' sho'
Uh-uh, naw, you smell that?
This is special right here (What-what, what-what-what?)
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie, baby
To the boogie-oogie-oogie
Yeah, you know, what's crackin', Dre?

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Just let me lay back and kick some old simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit, and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Throw on "Guilty Conscience" at concerts
And watch mosh pits
'Til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
(Watch out, nigga!)
Some of these crowds that Slim draws is rowdy as Crenshaw
Boulevard, when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw
Is niggas from Crenshaw, from Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again (Shit)
You and what army could harm me?
D.R.E. and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach
(Westside)
Came a long way to makin' these songs play
It'll be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long Uz' and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare just bein' Andre
But I

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg & Eminem]
Somehow, some way
Hello nigga, you know about Dogg-ay (Snoop Dogg)
Now let me cut these niggas up
And show 'em where the fuck I'm comin' from
I get the party crackin' from the shit that I be spittin', son
Hit-and-run, get it done, get the funds, split and run
Got about fifty guns
And I love all of 'em the same, bang-bang (Word up)
Damn, baby girl, what's your name? (What's your name?)
I forgot, what'd you say it was?
Damn, a nigga buzzed (Fucked up)
Hangin' in the club with my nephew Eminem (What's up Slim?)
(What up, Cuz? What up, Snoop?)
The Great White American Hope
Done hooked up with the king of the motherfuckin' West Coast
Baby

[Hook: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage
With ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it 'cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a 12 gauge about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in a bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shootin' with Puff
Bitch, please! You must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees
Come on

[Hook: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Verse 4: Eminem & Snoop Dogg]
Aw, naw, big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls (What?), dick six-inch long (Mm)
Back up in the heezy, baby
He's Shady (He's so crazy!)
Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal
Makin' a livin' off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right to say what I like?
And walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home, and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me, and people to see
That somewhere deep down there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot! You happy now?
Look here, I start some trouble everywhere that I go (That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know ('Cause they know)
I start some shit, they throw me out the back door (The back door)
Come back and shoot the club up with a .44 (A .44)

[Hook: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

X to the Z
Nate Dogg
Come on, yeah



[Zoe]
Justin? It's Zoe
Um, Kelly did not have me call
However, I just listened to Eminem in her car
It is the most disgusting thing I have ever heard in my entire life
And I seriously wanna call his fucking agent
And tell them how fucking disgusting he is
It, like, makes me upset
I'm now nauseous and I can't eat lunch, goodbye



[In the name of Odin!
Now Ragnar is dangerously ill
In the name of my father!
Nothing can stop us!
Attack!]

This is the story of a warrior, I know you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It ain't healthy to be making niggas paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys
I'm doing a hundred tween in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thing
Don't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain
Who wants to be king?! In this rap game

All hail your new king!
...nope
ME!
...nope
King Harald...
...nope
Hail King Bjorn!
...yeah!

[Around that sea are many wonderful people and places and towns... I want to go there!]

[With me in the name of Odin!
Now Ragnar is dangerously ill
In the name of my father!
Nothing can stop us!
Attack!]

It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down, give him a crown, he just throws it around
Its like a joke, hes like a king, but he dont rule a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry
He don't want the room or want the loot, he's in it for the sport
Running circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support, but he ain't begging for it
And you can love it, you can hate it,but you can't ignore it
You can't be that ig-nor-ant,though you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And if I'm fronting, man, you better come confront me for it

[You've all come to understand how a young farmer from Norway risked his life to explore the world
We have achieved my father's dream. We have the legal right to the land and to farm!]

[With me in the name of Odin!
Now Ragnar is dangerously ill
In the name of my father!
Nothing can stop us!
Attack!]

This is the story of a warrior, I know you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It ain't healthy to be making niggas paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys
I'm doing a hundred tween in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thing
Don't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain
Who wants to be king?! In this rap game

All hail your new king!
...nope
ME!
...nope
King Harald...
...nope
Hail King Bjorn!
...yeah!

[A civil war can only bring tragedy.]

[With me in the name of Odin!
Now Ragnar is dangerously ill
In the name of my father!
Nothing can stop us!
Attack!]



[Intro: Doctor & Nurse]
Scalpel
Here
Sponge
Here
Wait, he's convulsing, he's convulsing
Ahh
We're gonna have to shock him
Oh my God, oh my God
We're gonna have to shock him
Oh my God

[Verse 1]
These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts
Nurse, we're losin' him, check the pulse
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny-lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back, and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in Junior High, this kid said
"It's you and I, three o'clock sharp, this afternoon you die"
I looked at my watch, it was 1:20
"I already gave you my lunch money
What more do you want from me?"
He said, "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse"
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Somethin' told me, "Try to fake a stomach ache, it works"
I screamed, "Ow, my appendix feel like they could burst
Teacher, teacher, quick, I need a naked nurse"
"What's the matter?"
"I don't know, my leg, it hurts"
"Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy"
"Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee"
"Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework"
"But don't you wanna give me after school detention?"
"Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'ma let him"

[Chorus]
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage

[Verse 2]
Way before my baby daughter Hailie
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named DeAngelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
So every day he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef
But he just wouldn't leave
He kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, "You gonna die, honky"
The principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
(What's going on in here?)
I made 'em think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four-inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home later that same day
Started readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read
I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin', "What are you on, drugs?!
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug" (I'm sorry)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, "Look, bitch, what have you done?"
"Oh my God, I'm sorry, son"
Shut up, you cunt
I said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

[Chorus]
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song

[Outro]
Brain damage, it's brain damage
I got brain damage, it's brain damage
It's probably brain damage, it's brain damage
Brain damage, I got brain damage

Brain damage
Ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was going
But everywhere I go they keep playing my song



[Intro]
Or Eminem has a full line of chainsaws
Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem
Marshall Mathers, Eminem, the rapper Eminem
"Who can say for sure? Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer. If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use, society would reap a great benefit."

[Verse 1]
I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of Tourettes
Fuck, fuck-fuck, can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbors' hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up, bitches, with these hedge-trimmin' scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this mess
And make the best of this situation, I guess
'Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's
Despicable, I'm sick of just gettin' pushed, it's ridiculous
I look like a frickin' wuss, a pussy, this kid just took
My stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
This fucker was 12 and was six foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell; I got back up, all I did was book
Now there's usin' your head, Momma always said

[Chorus]
"If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous" (I'ma prove you wrong)
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus (I'ma be the bomb)
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness (Momma always said)
"Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous."
Guess it pays to be brainless

[Verse 2]
Fast forward some years later, a teenager; this is fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat I've accomplished
They've stomped me into the mud, gee, for what reason you stumped me?
But how do you get the shit beat out of you, beat down
And be upbeat when you don't have nothing?
No valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed
'Cause you're doomed from the start, it's like you grew up on Jump Street, from jump street
But if I could just get my head out my ass
I could accomplish any task, practicin' trash-talkin' in a trance
Locked in my room, yeah, but I got some plans, Momma
These damn rhymes are fallin' out of my pants pocket, I can't stop it!
And I'm startin' to blend in more, in school this shit helps for sure
I'm gettin' more self-assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore
I done put a stop to that, threw my first punchend of story
Still, in my skulls a vacant empty void, been usin' it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory: in this gourd there's a Ford engine
Door hinge, syringe, an orange, an extension cord, and a ninja sword
Not to mention four linchpins, an astringent stored
Ironin' board, a bench, a wrench, a ore winch, an attention whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fuckin' chain
Like an independent store, something's wrong with my
Head, just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I
Don't, 'cause I'd probably be Dahmer, 'cause Momma always said

[Chorus]
"If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous" (I'ma prove you wrong)
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus (I'ma be the bomb)
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness (Momma always said)
"Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous."
Guess it pays to be brainless

[Bridge]
Now my mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm
'Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb
I was on the bottom of the pile, gettin' stomped
But somehow I came out on top

[Verse 3]
I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, y'all, fuck it, I'm out cold, now everywhere I go
They scream out, "Go!", I'm 'bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Outsold the sell-outs, freak the hell out Middle America
Hear 'em yell out in terror, they were so scared, and those kids
Just about belted out whatever spouted
Or fell out my smart aleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate? So be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Motherfuckin' difficult, yeah
'Til then, hopefully you little homos get over your fears and phobias
It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers
'Til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's
A stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You motherfuckin' insert insult here
Who the fuck woulda thunk that one little ole MC'd
Be able to take the whole culture and reupholster it?
And boy, they did flock; can't believe this little hick locked
This hip-hop shit in his hip pocket, and still the shit got
That white-trash traffic in gridlock, shit hoppin' like six blocks
From a Kid Rock/Insane Clown Posse concert in mid-Oc-
-tober, and God forbid I see a wizard
And get a brain in my titanium cranium, y'all
'Cause I'll turn into the Unabomber, Momma always said

[Chorus]
"If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous" (I'ma prove you wrong)
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus (I'ma be the bomb)
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness (Momma always said)
"Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous."
Guess it pays to be brainless

[Outro]
"Insaneness" ain't even a word, you stupid fuck!
Neither is "ain't"

Hi, baby, thanks for calling 9-7-0-SLUT
The hottest live one-on-one line in the city

You know what I'm saying?

I know you fucking him
I know you fucking him
I know you-



It's a long year, pretending I belong here
One day, I plan to be a family man, happily married
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
'til I'm glad to be buried



Broke the rubber
Busted a nut up in your mother
So how you feel about having another little brother
Nasty motherfucker
Talking like a trucker
Snatch your bitch up out of your track
I Smack her up and fuck her
Always talk shit high
Smoking chocolate Thai
So y'all can die
Just by walking by giving an awkward eye
I've lost my motherfreaking marbles
Smelling like a brewery
Jewelling at the way your jewellery sparkles
Head full of charcoals
Smoked out brain particles
Burning holes in clothes articles
A retarded fool since I started school
Burned the weed before I learned to read
Disregarded rules
Skip the classes to blaze the blunt ashes
Kissing front dashes and smashing up cars like stunt crashes
Hall passes for restrooms
Chewing mushrooms
Doing rush fumes in the lunch room
Looking nervous
Liquor in my thermos
Hung with hermits who carry guns without permits
Staring at the bitch with firm tits
Jacking off
Aiming straight for both lips when my sperm spits



[Intro]
Ahh! You sick asshole let me go
Somebody please! Help!
Oh my God, please help me! Oh
"It fits perfect"

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Better watch out, sucka, now I got ya where I want ya
Onslaught coming and I'm packing in my lunch a
Bunch of missile launchers and a bunch of contra
Band, van full of ganja, now come on, jump
Man, stop moshin' Marshall; oh my God, ya
Doing the cha-cha and the Cucaracha with a quadra
Plegic, boogying down to Frank Sinatra
Lindsay to the Lohan, lick it while you let me watch ya
Who'da knew the Buddha'd do to me what it's done?
Such cynicism when theres izm in my system
Blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lips, son
So much on my hands, I got to give my kids a fist bump
Christopher Reeves swimmin' in my swim trunks
"Mister  Help me" is what he said to me and then sunk
Women, skinning them and cutting them up in chunks
In comes the woman with cocoa butter skin, once

[Chorus]
Once again, they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Always, you can see him lurkin' in the hallways
Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawl space
How the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place?
Hide 'em in the wall, well, how long will the drywall take?
Well, fuck it then, I got nothing but time, I'll wait
Until it dries, for the moment, I guess you're all safe
After I sand it and buff it, I guess that I'll paint
My chainsaw's out of gas, my regular saw ain't
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumbling
You can even hear the evil spirits coming from within
Someone's in the back of my damn house, rummaging
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want her skin
Vinn, on the hunt again, when will it ever end?
Evelyn, why you trying to fight? You will never win
Severin' legs, arms; damn, there goes another limb
Pull the lever then; trap door, death is evident

[Chorus]
Once again, they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now what you know about Buffalo Bill? Nothin', so chill
Fuckin' ho, you better fuckin' hold still
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill
Cut 'em, gut 'em, and just get to stuffin' those girls
Man, I think she had enough of those pills
Sedate her, then I wait, I come back later
Just-a clutching those steel
Blades, baby, when I cut ya don't squeal
I hate the loud noises, I fuckin' told you!
I keep hearing voices like
"Wouldn't ya like to go and get your butcher knife
And push it right through her
While you put ya shish kebab skewers into her
Barbecue her, would you do to her what you usually do
To a girl who's skin's newer?"
(In a world of sin you are, this is turning into a
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornament you are)
I'll be sure to Ginsu ya 'til there's no more skin to ya
Boo-yah! Who ya think you're fucking with?
Duck, because here he comes again

[Chorus]
Once again, they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill



[Intro]
Yo, check it out
What's fucked up
Is I don't see either one of us budging

[Verse 1]
"I'm withholding my anger
Though I'd like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
It's my right to insist
That he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect"
That's what he says to himself
As he use his magazines to trash me
As he sits with both his feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed
And starts imagining things
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy
It just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He don't exist in this world
So he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins 'til he hurls himself into rage
And it's destroying him slowly
'Cause he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself, he has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now he's acting like a bully so he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
And he has no choice but to scream and raise his voice up at me
'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared

[Hook]
You ain't no motherfucking (bully)
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully)
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no (bully)
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully)
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...)
And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...)

[Verse 2]
Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies, no more unfortunately
There's so many other motherfuckers that just are
They just keep hounding at me
Now that I'm down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja
But his ass is such a puppet, Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv's on a string and Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough and Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down
But our building's made out of bricks so you ain't taking out shit
And dawg you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull the race card and it backfires in your face hard
'Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus this stylist that you fucked when you was ecstasied up
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch

[Hook]
You ain't no motherfucking (bully)
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully)
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no (bully)
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully)
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...)
You must be taking too much (E...)

[Verse 3]
Now what bothers me the most about hip-hop is we so close
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master J, Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugz, Slang Ton, and Freaky Tah
It's like a never-ending cycle that just seems to come full circle
Everybody's gotta be so fucking hard
And I'm not excluding myself 'cause I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men, we learn to let shit go, but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold when someone steps on our toes
It's no exception, it goes for every man
But if I really gave a fuck about Ja like he claims he does
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feeding him pills so if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight if the situation escalates
Any worse, we're gon' lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Hailie's name

[Hook]
You ain't no motherfucking (bully)
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully)
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no (bully)
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully)
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...)
Irvine, get your boy off that (E...)

[Outro]
Get at me, dog
Holla



Yeah... Shady
Haha (Wooo)
50 Cent... GgGgG G Unit
Haha (Here we go again)
Yeah Uh huh (Haha)

Does it make you mad when I switch my flow
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent I'm on fire 'cause shady said so... I'm On Fire

Here we go now
Everybodies in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
Ain't trying to use nobody as a steppin' stone

But don't compare me I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say what what up keep steppin' and just rep D12

Keep my nose clean stay away from weapons jail
And livin' wreckless, but if you would check my belt
You may see soemthing else I use to protect myself
A vest to stop a ruger and deflect the shells and

Send em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more I don't got to
Got under cover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people crossed the line

But this motherfucker Ja mustve lost his mind
That X has got him thinkin' that he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac now his tryin' to be him next
So which one are you X Luther Pac or Michael?

Just keep singing the same song recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and hailey dance to your songs we like you
And you don't really want to step inside on my group

Come on now you know the white boy will bite you
I'll hurt your pride dog and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to
With syllable after syllable ill just slap ya

Killin' you faster
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of
That shit you on but if you want it you got it
You'd bump this shit too if we didn't diss you on it

But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants ta
So what's the deal where was all of the tough talk
When I walked up to ya like Ja what up dog

How come you didn't say you had a problem then
When you was standin' there with all you men
We could've solved it then I'm a grown man dogg come holla
All you did was slap hands smile and swallow

Another one of them lil x pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you want to be (Cmon)

I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You can talk I'm still the m.c
You don't want to bump heads with me

You couldn't slug me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot my bars would melt you
Ja you... stuart little shells will lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol

I clap at yo ass with this chrome 38
And put 6 through yo hat so seven in 3 eights (?)
Erv you ain't shug knight you shook light
I put my knife in ya wind pipe

Then freeze on this turn pike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got rolled two times so your ass is lame
I'm down to die for this shit all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with segal

Yo fuck that I'm tired of these -
Industry niggas [unknown] you get out of hand
I'm gone find you whereabouts [unknown]
We kill in new york even in Compton they understand

I'm on the block where you was raised [unknown]
They see me poppin' more ice because I could [unknown]
You probably forgot your way around the hood good
Least when your paranoid its hard to make a song

How you want it with us and laugh [unknown] got make up on
Every magazine I open you on your knees takin' prayer pictures
And you ain't even got shot yet you scared bitches
You don't know nothin' bout what pain is sucker
I put put your ass in the ground like a train conductor motherfucker

Yeah Nigga
Shady Aftermath
G Unit
Fuck you think they call us G Unit for

'Cause we move units
Uh Huh

Yeah
Shady (Ha-ha)
50 Cent
G-G-G-G-G-Unit (Ha-ha)
Here we go again
Yeah
The evil genius, Green Lantern

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
Does it make you mad when I switch my flow?
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent, I'm on fire 'cause Shady said so
I'm on fire

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Everybody's in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
I ain't tryin' to use nobody as a steppin' stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say, "What up?", keep steppin', and just rep D12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
And livin' reckless, but if you go check my belt
You may see something else I use to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja must have lost his mind
That X, got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac, now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael?
Just keep singin' the same song, recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and Hailie dance to your songs, we like you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
Come on now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I'll hurt your pride, dawg, and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, with syllable after
Syllable I just slap you, killin' you faster
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs
Of that shit you on, but if you want it, you got it
You'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta (Green Lantern!)
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants to
So what's the deal, where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like, "Ja, what up, dawg?"
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there with all your men, we coulda solved this then
I'm a grown man, dawg, come holla
All you did was slap hands, smile and swallow
Another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be
Come on!

[Chorus: 50 Cent and Eminem]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me (You know you don't want it with me)
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me (You know you don't want it with me)
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars will melt you
Ja, you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol
I clap at your ass with this chrome .38
And put six thru your hats, a seven and 3/8's
Irv, you ain't Suge Knight, you shook night
I'll put my knife in your wind pipe and breeze through the turnpike
You know and I know who took your chain
You got robbed two times so your ass is lame
I'm down to die for this shit, all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with Steven Segal, bitch

[Chorus: 50 Cent and Eminem]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
Lloyd Banks!

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Fuck that, I'm miles away
And these industry niggas startin' to get outta hand
Like I won't find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out your man
We killin' New York, even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised doin' chocolate up out your van and (Break it, break it, break it down!)
They see me pop a boy icy 'cause I could
You been gone so long you probably forgot your way around the hood (Hood)
'Cause when you paranoid it's hard to make a song
How you want it with us if half of your artists got make-up on?
Easy now, and you on your knees takin' prayer pictures
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared bitches
You don't know nothin' 'bout what pain is, sucka
I'll put your ass underground like a train conductor, muh'fucker

[Chorus: 50 Cent and Eminem]
I know you don't want it with me (You know you don't want it with me)
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me (Wanna bump heads with me)
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me (Wanna bump heads with me)

[Outro: Tony Yayo]
Yeah, nigga
Yeah, Shady Aftermath
G-Unit
Fuck you think they call us G-Unit for?
'Cause we move units, huh-uh
Don't think we ain't billin' you for this motherfuckin' studio time
Matter of fact, keep it on 50, we'll call it even, ha



[Intro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Marshall! Sounds like an SOS
Holy wack unlyrical lyrics, Andre, you're fucking right!
To the Rapmobilelet's go!
(Marshall! Marshall!)
Bitches and gentlemen! It's showtime!
Hurry hurry, step right up!
Introducing the star of our show
His name is (Marshall!)
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you (Marshall!)


[Verse 1: Eminem]
You 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old Doc is (back)
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear, fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so

[Chorus: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers, Dre, holy bat syllables!
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone, time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
Flow's too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People, when you're rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!

[Chorus: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo
Two old friends, why panic? You already know
Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats, MCs don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
Yo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a "hell..."? (Hell yeah!)

[Chorus: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Outro: Eminem]
So there you have it, folks
(Marshall!) has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay
And never go away
Until our dying day
Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)
So until next time, friends
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night, everyone!
Thank you for coming! Your host for the evening (Marshall!)
Oh! Heh

Oh! Heh



Jumped out of the 2nd floor of a record store
With a Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette recorder
In Ecuador with Edward Norton
Witness the metamorphosis
Of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman
From the Hessian war and
Hence the origin of the Headless Horseman
Born with the endorphins of a pathetic orphan
Endless source and reservoir
Of extension cords in dresser drawers
And deadbolts on the bedroom doors
And sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
Excellent boyfriend

Use intercourse to settle scores
With women who have vendettas towards men
Dickhead is forced in 'til there's shredded foreskin
Reddish torn and they're only bein' fed a portion
Bed sores and sore shins
Pregnant whores can get abortions
Fetish for stickin' metal forks in, self-absorption
Skeletor, I went to Hell and fell a floor
A predator, I'm headed for competitors
Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals
I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
Stegosaurus, Chuck Norris with a thesaurus
Yes, of course, a mess of warrants
You want some? Come and get some, boys!
I'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course
On excessive force and pressure points
And dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
Dress and four inch heels to address the court
With a bullseye on his back, his whole chest and torso
Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him

In my present form I'm Desert Storm
Appetite for destruction there's no suppressant for
Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel
Unpleasant, horrible; hello, gorgeous!
The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
Met a contortionist, said, "When you wanna get sexual?"
She said, "However I fit in your schedule. I'm flexible."
Expired tags on the Saturn, got Catherine Bach
In the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on
At a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph
For this asshole cop's daughter
Laugh 'cause I called her a brat on it
He spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock
Had a heart attack and dropped dead
Started fallin' back with it
And got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock

One ball and half a dick, Apple Watch
Crack front axle, walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff, pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel
Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and *crash sound*
Asked if they had a laugh in stock
That was fuckin' stupid

You got it twisted, all 'cause I offered this bitch
A doggie biscuit, you call me misogynistic
Bitch, get to massagin' this dick!
Like spas in this bitch, slob on it with gobs of lipstick
Got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with
It's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with
She's non-existent
Robin Thicke with a throbbin' dick on some suave and slick shit
But I shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launches
Misfit, blond and nitwit
Like I've gone ballistic, with a frostin' tip kit
Screamed, "I hate blondes," and became one, I'm optimistic
Love to start shit
Shovin' Clark Kent's undergarments in the glove compartment
Of the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxxx
I'm double parkin' up at Targets, trouble causer, a double crosser
Shadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across
Olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults
A couple lawsuits, enough to cause a stomach ulcer
Same damn brain scan results as Rainman's is
Something's off, but when Dustin Hoffman's
Dressin' up in your mummy costume
On stage dancin' to "Brain Damage," what's the problem?
Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status
Run the faucet, I'ma dunk
A bunch of Trump supporters underwater
Snuck up on 'em in Ray-Bans in a gray van with a spray tan
It's a wrap, like an ACE bandage
Don't-give-a-fuck persona, to my last DNA strand
E&J in the waistband, at the VMAs with the stagehand
She wants kielbasa, pre-arrange an escape plan
Three-inch blade on point, like a See-and-Say
Consider me a dangerous man
But you should be afraid of this dang candidate
You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet
'Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'
And that's what you wanted
A fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button
Who doesn't have to answer to no onegreat idea!

If I was president, gettin' off is
The first order of business, once I get in office
Second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam
Naked, laughin', dick cupped in hand
Screamin', "Fuck safe sex!"
Throw a latex and an AIDS test at him
Tell Congress I run this land
And I want the rubber banned, and make it snappy
Addiction to friction and static
Addict who can't escape the habit
Continue to chase the dragon
But as fate would have it, I walked up in Major Magics
Dressed as the maintenance man
In a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket
With a gauge to blast it
And sped away in the station wagon
Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's
Crazy asses in the backseat
Throwin' Stayfree pads at me
Dead passenger in the passenger seat
Unfasten the safety latches
And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard
I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
'Finna get a murder case and catch it
Like you threw it at me encased in plastic

And send Dylann Roof through the windshield of the Benz
Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'...
Like a windmiller with a thin build while his skin's peelin'
And skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder
Knock it into the upper peninsula
You wanna go against 'zilla? The Rap God
When will I quit? Never been realer
The in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt
Whose pens iller than Prince in a chinchilla
Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller
Revenge killer, avenge syllable binge
Fill a syringe, 'til I
Draw first blood
Even pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular
Couldn't be more awkwarder
Cause you're innocence I robbed you of
It's my fingers that got stuck up
Taught ya ta, not give a
Slapstick, hockey puck
The broad hunter with the sawed off
Like an arm when it's lopped off of ya
But I'm not gonna, get the shotgun
Or the Glock, I'm gonna opt for the ox
Cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I shop
And it's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious fucker
The Rock Hudson of rock 'cause who would have thought
This much of a cocksucker to go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter
That was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned
I'm unravelin' quickly
My squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me
Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey
Tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles
Like what happened to Chris Reeve's spine column
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems
Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles
And why I haven't come back on these faggots who diss me is
More of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel

But my patience is wearing thin
Swear I been contemplatin' rubbing shit in your face 'til I smear it in
Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
And never appear again
If you actually had fuckin' careers to end
But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them
Molly, I'm gone off you
Man, light some kush
You're my first take, I'll nail you
Can't lie, I gush
If I won you over, you would be the grand prize
I'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push
You can get it in the can like some Anheuser Busch
Jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush
Mushed against your damn side, your puss
And thighs are squished
What kind of attire's that?
I'm ready to be rode
Psychopath, bet you we'll get it poppin' like a flat
Light the match to ignite the wrath
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half
Piper Chapmans might just have to picket me
Like a scab
Hard to describe in fact
Startling violent perhaps
Are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that
And you aren't really surprised at that
But as far as these lines I rap
And these bars, wouldn't dial it back if I star 69ed the track

Why am I such a dick?



[Verse]
I'm cancerous
So when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fucking legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no!) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked
More than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fucking tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?



[Intro]
(I, I wanna grow up too)
"Uncle Marshall, will you tell us a bedtime story?"
Here we go!

[Verse 1]
Now, once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came, and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper-wood
So these silly little fans, they were misled
By a nerdy Internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, Clef, we're gonna make some cash."
"Grab this silver paint and just paint my ass."
Hey, mister, would you care to bear witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister?
Stanibus, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the "Mr
Not-Havin'-It," it's the Mad, sinister
Dr. Evil, with his bag of tricks for
This little antagonistic faggot
Dick-sucking ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny-Fag-Kaniff-sta
You bastard, I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canibus, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!

[Hook]
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

[Verse 2]
Now, at first, I ain't really understand this shit
Picture me, for a second, and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat Mansion relaxin' when
All of a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners, it's
Canibitch, on some 'Stan Lives' shit
It creeped me out at first; man, this is sick
But me, bein' just as sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters, you were tellin' me shit like
You respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter, you asked how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me
The fourth letter: "Slim, you're really startin' to upset me."
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
The sixth letter, there's a bomb threat on our building
This crazy motherfucker's really tryna kill me
So I went back and read the first few letters that said
Some shit about a message you left
Oh shit! That's not a E, that's an A!
This dude wants to leave me a 'massage,' he's gay!
Right away, I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre
"We got a bogey," "Marshall, I'm on the way."

[Hook]
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

[Verse 3]
So, in two seconds flat, Dre's at my crib
Only thing is, we both know where this kid lives
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
"Shit. Oh, Dre, wait a minute, that's it!
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo-boost
We can fly over the border!" "Let's Go!" [whoosh]
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed
"What was that? Oh, Jermaine Dupri."
"Fuck it," keep goin', no time to waste
"Wait, back up. Hit him one more time, in case."
"Okay," fuck, now he's draggin' under the car
"Oh well, only thirty more thousand miles!"
Meanwhile, me and Dre are tryna conversate
Just tryna find a reason for the constant hate
And tryna figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propane'
"He couldn't have fell off that hard." Ain't no way!
What happened to the way you was rappin'
When you was scandalous?
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist!
Plus, he raps with his regular voice
[Four impacts] "What was that?" "Pet Shop Boys."
So, we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin', but his ass was rotted
And he kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figured if I stick him with a fork, he's done
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin'Christ!
He won't die! This guy's like a battered wife!
He's like Kim: he keeps comin' back for more
But he won't fight back, I cracked his jaw
Hold up! 'Bis, quit foldin' up!
Punch me in the chest, make my shoulders touch
Do something! At least one punchline!
Come on! 'Til the meter reads Nine! Nine! Nine-
Ty nine percent of my fans are blond!
'Bis, come on, answer me, man, respond!
Tell me 'bout the sun, rain, moon and stars!
Intergalactical metaphors from Mars!
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs!
Bite another line from Redman's song!
Suddenly, the stub of a dead man's arm
From a midget reaches out from under the car
It's J.D.! This motherfucker won't die, neither!
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether
We swamped the bitch in it; stomped the bitch again
"Compton!" "Detroit, bitch, talk some shit again!"
"Stomp him!" "Switch feet!" "Stomp him!" "Switch again!"
"Dre, all right, he's dead, dog, quit kickin' him!
I think Stanibus jumped off the bridge again!" ("Ahh!")
"Damn," "He disappeared, yo, he's gone, he did it again!"

[Hook]
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch



[Intro]
"Breaking news: Detroit rapper Eminem cancels his sold-out European tour to check himself into rehab after admitting an addiction to sleep medication. We'll have more on this story as it develops."
"Shady Records recording artist Obie Trice has apparently survived a gunshot to the head in what appears to be a random drive-by shooting. Meanwhile, Eminem is rumored to be alienated--"
"On again/off again relationship with..."
"This just in, a tour bus involving Eminem's bus..."
"Updating a story we brought you earlier about gunfire at an after-hours club, we've learned that the rapper Proof has been fatally shot."
"Shady/Aftermath recording artist..."
"Long-time best friend of Eminem and a member of the rap group D12"
"D12, back in the news again today..."
"Is it a sabbatical or the end? The rumors and speculation continue to swirl around Eminem. He insists he's just taking a break, but doubters believe he's retiring, leaving us all to ask, 'Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?'"

[Verse 1]
So this is it, this is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But somethin' changed the minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit, then it turned me to a monster
I became a hypocrite, concert after concert
I was rakin' in the dough, rollin' in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom, there was nowhere for me
To not go and be seen, and just go and be me
And there was no in-between, you either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a 3, then three
Years later they go back and re-rate it
Then called The Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be Illmatic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk

[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold

[Verse 2]
I got a letter from a fan that said he's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every letter I get
But something told me to go ahead and open it
But, why would someone pray for you
When they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at, I've already told you
At least a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but I've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watching it from a opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts, and that's the only word I can think of
Right now, on how to describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it
Just watch what you wish for 'cause I got the shit

[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold



[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues and Eminem]
I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry were alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope youll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 1st, 1995, dear Hailie
This is your song

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You'll be coming out of Mommy's stomach soon
I better do something quick if I'ma be able to support you
I can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy
That's all that matters for the time being
But obviously assuming you will be
Just thinking ahead, Ima make it if it kills me
Lets see how far I can take it with this music
I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion (ha!)
Sorry for sloppy writing
The pen in my hand is shaking, please excuse me
Dads a little nervous, but at the same time excited
If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write them
With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
As I'm using in this letter, maybe they can feel me as I'm
Trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl
Welcome to Mom and Dads crazy world
Love, Daddy, maple-flavored kisses, buttered pancakes, and syrup

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues and Eminem]
I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 1st, 1996, dear Hailie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You got your momma's personality, same eyes as I got
Her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are
Sorry for that, a little minor mishap
But you'll grow into them, baby, I'm on the grind now
I'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters at studios
While I'm tryna keep the lights on
Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far?
I just keep steering, I'ma turn into someone
I haven't the slightest clue what I'ma do if it falls through
You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
My Infinite CD flopped, too many soft tunes
They're talking bad about Dad, it's ticking me off too
Makes me feel like I don't belong or something, ooh
I think I might have just stumbled onto something new
Got a prediction for the future, I'm hoping that you
Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues and Eminem]
I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 24th, 2007, dear Hailie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain
A lot's happened in between them since I rised to this fame
I've said your name but always tried to hide your face
This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you, but dang
I never knew it'd be like this, if I did I wouldn't have done it
You ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're being punished?!
Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
I can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it
I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it
One-hundred percent finished
Fed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote
As a goodbye note, but your dad's at the end of his rope
I'm sliding down a slippery slope
Anyways sweetie, I better go
I'm getting sleepy, love, Dad shit, I don't know

[The sound of a bottle of pills being opened is heard. Eminem ingests them and collapses over the floor]



[Verse: Eminem]
There are enough insults in my head to fill up a swear jar
And have it overflowing
So don't get me going: don't dare start
You'll never see me again: Amelia Earhart
I'm popping a wheelie, off to a really unfair start
I'm past grinding, for me guess I just be grounded up
Like Ground Round or a pound of chuck
Tightly-wound as fuck 'till the Fire Marshalls come shut
Fire Marshall, down and up
I suggest you better shut the fuck up
And stop fucking around and duck!
I ain't playing this time, I told you I'm out for blood
So to say "I keep it 100" would probably sound redundant
Like calling a bitch a ho or asking a gal to suck
And blow on your dick cock
Is she up to screwing? Down to fuck?
It's a man's world and I'm trapped in a land of smut
With a thousand sluts strapped and muzzled
Running through a house of mutts
In other words, I'm shutting every one of you bitches' mouths up
And I'm watching my language if I tell you to kiss my fucking butt!
And ain't shit changed, my shit still don't stink, player
My farts may have gotten staler ever since
I became a trailer park celebrity
Maybe my complexion became a little paler
Poster child for white trash
I'm a Garbage Pail Kid sailor, yeah
See me I'm all up on your bitch means I'mma rape her
All I got for these hoes is dick, duct tape and a stapler
So bitch, you better look for table scraps to scrape up
I don't subscribe to the News or the Free Press
But homie, I get the paper!



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Instinctive nature to bring the anguish (Yeah)
To the English language
With this ink, you haters get rode on like a piece of paper
This rap shit got me travelin' place to place
You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out
Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, gohruh
That's what it's like when the mic is out
'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it
'Til your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons, expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped
To a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air, I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch!

[Chorus: PHresher]
I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Eminem & PHresher]
And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yeah, uh (Haha), and still conjoined at
The hip with hop, still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place (Yeah) like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the buildin', boy
I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
(Like what?) Like a real thin joint it
(What?) Comes on Quilted Northern
(And what?) In a built-in toilet
(Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (Woof)
I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies' tails
Should write a children's storybook (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
(Off what?) Off the feel of going in
(Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City
Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me
'Cause I conned her into
Rippin' the condom in two (Woo!)
Dick is a bargainin' tool
Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude
I go there, you wouldn't
Well, I still have a few views in common with you
Just not YouTube, 'cause

[Chorus: PHresher]
I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

[Verse 3: Eminem]
You're a has-been
That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash (Bitch!)
Stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan (Yeah!)
Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I
Clock rejects into the next life
Talking reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my Colombian necktie
Prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride
Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribed
Any old lie to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
(Music, please!) Enthusiast of the roofie
Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Glued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!
No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your mothafuckin' throat like

[Chorus: PHresher]
throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Eminem & PHresher]
And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew



[Intro: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Take 'em to church, I'm talkin' the tabernacle
It's the return of the body snatcher
Walk in the spot, make my woman smack ya (whoo!)
In a fruit fight, I aim at your Adam's apple
Pull up in the candy car, eatin' a candy bar
And my girl eatin' a candy apple
Yeah (mm), I line their ass up (up)
I aim at their goozer (baow!)
All of these stones on my neck, uh
They must have looked at Medusa
Pockets Rasputia of course
I drove some rims to court
I fucked some twins before
I had a Benz before, this is the sin report
This is the murder, murder, pass the burner, Em (uh)
Your money shorter than an acronym (ayy)
Big body when I'm backin' in (whoo!)
Ladi-dadi, got a bunch of bodies
Niggas fakin', niggas human traffickin' (whoo!)
I'm on the Act' again, uh
This ain't a accident, uh
King like Ak-Ron
I run the trap again, you on the treadmill (treadmill)
Never Neverland, shit came with a Ferris wheel (goddamn!)
Ferris day off, baby, AR in the same car
Most of y'all my sons, aww, look at little JR
F12 same color Kate Moss
Uh, I'm talkin' wristin' the pot
I'm talkin' this and you not
I'm talkin' bricks and you not
I'm talkin' straight up and down, nigga, like 6 o'clock
This is the equinox, this what the people want
Somebody at the door, I heard the speaker knock, uh

[Chorus: PHresher]
I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

[Verse 2: PHresher]
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors
These bitches got flavors
They all wanna smoke but ain't doin' no labor
But they shoppin' at Raleys, they stingin' like tasers
Act Hollywood like they play for the Lakers
They fly on the latest
Crocs, alligators, say hi to my haters
Pardon my neighbor
We eatin' that chicken, lobster, potatoes
You must be sniffin' that yayo
If you don't think I'm that nigga
Swagger on ten since a day old
It's a-okay though, whippin' up whip like it's mayo
Every track is a K.O., technical K.O.
Go off your head like I'm Ayo
Out of this world, talkin' NATO
It's 'cause of jail, ho, don't be an A-hole
'Cause I got shooters that shoot when I say so (lay low!)
Wanna be in my shoes, you ain't paid no dues
Real nigga, you ain't break no rules (hell yeah!)
High school, niggas ate yo' food
Might dumb it down a little, but I ain't no fool (hell yeah!)
Niggas hate every day, B (yeah)
Shit is O.C. lately (yeah)
Gotta break 'em off with these Dre beats (yeah)
Or I might go crazy (hell yeah!)
These niggas too goddamn lazy (too lazy)
Don't ever, ever, ever try to play me (to play me)
Lil' shawty now comin' from BK (BK)
But I'm tryna come up like JAY-Z (like JAY-Z)
Nothin' but love for my idols (love for my idols)
I feel entitled to titles (to titles)
Fuck it, man, I want the title (I want the title)
Submission, they goin' all viral

[Chorus: PHresher]
Like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah (hell yeah)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Bin Laden with a pen, bodyin' again
I begin slaughterin' your men, prolly shoulda been
Ali or the Svengali embodiment of sin
Like a Saudi in the Taliban plotting an event
In the lobby of the Intercontinental with an obvious intent
And I would not even relent
Up on a little like Osama with a bomb under the bin
And down the middle of the Pentagon
And hit a kindergartener with a rental (stop!)
Back and forth, back and forth
Like Jack Kevorkian's ass to court
"Rap mature! Why can't you be like Macklemore?" (huh?)
"Why you always gotta smack a whore?" (huh?)
It's likely the psychiatric ward's a last resort (huh?)
Something's gotta give, that's for sure
Yet you keep comin' back for more
Not as raw as I was, 'Walk On Water' sucks
Bitch, suck my dick!
Y'all saw the tracklist and had a fit 'fore you heard it
So you formed your verdict
While you sat with your arms crossed
Did your little reaction videos and talked over songs (chill!)
Nah dog, y'all sayin' I lost it?
Your fuckin' marbles are gone (wait, Em!)
But nowadays, every flow, every cadence sound the same (skrrt)
Brain's a powder keg, I draw inspiration outta hate
Real pain in the paper, I don't trace
But if I look strange and outta place
It's 'cause I'm an alien, that's why I write 'til the page is outta space
Yeah, from 7 Mile in Novara
To "How can I be down?", all of us tryna pile in the car (yeah!)
We shot for the stars (yeah!)
'Cause we only got so much time in this world (yeah!)
So rewind it to your high school dance to the night before
If you think you're promised tomorrow (yeah!)
Now I'm 'bout to fool again
This tune is sick, it's luminous, the moon is lit
A freakin' lunatic, a human computer chip
And I'm soon to stick a broom in the uterus of your Hooters chick
If I was you, I wouldn't do nothin' stupid due to the mood I'm in
I'm losin' it, you get chewed like a Junior Mint
Show me who to rip, it's time for you to get screwed
Empty the lubricant and put super glue in it (woo!)
How many fuckin' rappers did I go through?
Dispel doubt, but you won't admit I smoked
And you was spellbound, hellbound in my snowsuit
But am I s'posed to sound like everything else out?
'Cause I don't get compared to it, only myself now
And I can see the fair-weather fans and sales down
But the only way I care is if I let myself down
But what the fuck have I woke to?
Time to eat the vocals and shit out Pro Tools
I know you still want me to ill out, don't you?
Hopin' the old Slim's gonna spill out, open
Fire on your whole camp with this spit, I roast you
So chill out, no, you
Hoes couldn't roast me with the shit I wrote you
Then I took a stand, went at Tan-Face and practically cut my motherfuckin' fan base in half and still outsold you
You just called my shit trash?
Thank God, I rap better when the odds are stacked
"Revival's wack, I don't like the 'Zombie' track
And when he's talkin' that garbage psychotic crap
Where's your content at?
What's with all the conscious rap?
P!nk, Beyonc this and Kehlani that" (yeah!)
I just add it to the fuel in my rocket pack
'Til I'm ready to respond, then I'ma launch it at 'em
Idiotic from the fuckin' embryonic sac
To the body bag, I'll be back
And when I am, I'll be at your fuckin' throat like

[Outro: PHresher]
Like Chloraseptic



[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, you know, technically
I'm not even really supposed to be here right now
So fuck it, might as well make the most of it
(Amen, Amen)
Yeah! Ha ha, feels good
Guess I'm lucky
Some of us don't get a second chance
But I ain't blowin' this one
Nah, man, ha ha
Shit, I feel like I can do anything now

[Bridge: Eminem]
Who can catch lightning in the bottle, set fire to water
Comin' out the nozzle on the fire hose, flyer than swatters?
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand
Take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme and freeze the clock
Take the hands of time and cuff 'em
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start to bug, prick, you better flee, 'cause I get ticked
It's a wrap, I was down when I was down, I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch you to the ground, you trick!
It's a trap, fuck my last CD, the shit's in my trash
I'll be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes
And keep winkin' and blowin' kisses
'Cause you're flirtin' with death
I'm destroyin' your livelihood, I ain't just hurtin' your rep
I catch a flow and get goin'
No remorse I'm showin', ain't slowin' for no one
Knowin' there's nothin' you can do about it
Zero in on the target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot, parked in it too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid salivawhat can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up
Stand behind you like "Whooo!"
That boy's hot enough to melt Hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
See, you can hate him, he don't blame you
Frankly, he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how 'bout you?

[Refrain: Eminem]
Now guess who? (Hey!) Here's a clue (Hey!)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass, (Hey!), he's in your ass
He's all up in your psyche too
Now, what's his name?

[Chorus: Kobe]
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
If I had a time machine, I'd be Cinderella Man
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
Music is my time machine, so call me
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)

[Bridge 2: Eminem]
Fuck catchin' lightning, he struck it
Screamed "Shut up!" at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down
And made it rain upward
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
Rewound the future to the present
Paused it  don't ask how
Fuck the past, mothafucka
He's the shit right now, he's
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Cinderella man, Cinder Fellow, Shady dane
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane
Raise hell, from Hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same old
Can't afford to be a lame-o
In this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say bye to the old, H-I to the new
Que ser, consider it his last hurrah
The coup de grce, raise 'em high
In the sky, keep 'em up, time to bring the place alive
Thanks for bein' patient, I
Will make no more mistakes, shit, my
Potato's baked, homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin' weedyeah, faggot, the steaks are high
Shit, I ain't even suppose to be here by the grace of God
The skin of my teeth and the hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights, I'd hate to lie
How fuckin' irritated are you? How much in your face am I?
It ain't shit you could do but fear it, Proof is here in spirit
And I'm his spittin' image, I mirror it when I stand near it
Your pussy lyric, I "cunt" hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists?

[Refrain: Eminem]
Who? Here's a clue (Hey!)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass, (Hey!), he's in your ass
He's all up in your psyche too
(Hey!) Now, (Hey!) what's his name?

[Chorus: Kobe]
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
If I had a time machine, I'd be
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
Music is my time machine, so call me
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)



[Intro]
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prob'ly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)

[Verse 2]
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)

[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems
Victim of Mnchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up
It makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now
And it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick
He's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see hershe won't even be at your funeral (ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well, guess what, I am deaddead to you as can be!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Look at me now! I bet you're probably sick of me now
Ain't you, Momma? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry

[Intro]
Get down tonight
Get down tonight
Get down tonight
Get down tonight
What up? What up? What up? Get down tonight
Outsidaz. Get down tonight
Outsidaz. Get down tonight
[?] Young D. Get down tonight
[?]

[Verse 1]
My favorite color is red, like the blood shed
From Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish kabab
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so
Shit, I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent-minded
No, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit
Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit (one, two)
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
And gave a bitch herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my EP on your Christmas gift list
You want to get high? Here, bitch, just sniff this!

[Hook]
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)

[Verse 2]
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck
And I was wavin' it at everybody, screamin' "I suck!"
I go on stage in front of a sell-out crowd
And yell out loud: "All y'all get the hell out now!"
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up, y'all, I'm sorry
"But Eminem, this is your record release party!"
I'm bored out of my gourd, so I took a hammer
And nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage (oh)
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit

[Hook]
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)

[Verse 3]
Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'em I was Mike D, they was like, "Gee
I don't know, he might be!"
I told 'em, "Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster." (okay, bye)
Peace out, then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out
'Til I started bustin' freestyles, broke out
Then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect (bring)
I want to make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset

[Hook]
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)



[Intro: Eminem & (Jazmine Sullivan)]
Yeah. (Oh)
This game is like cocaine. (I want this more than anything in the world)
Haha... So do I... at least I thought I did
(Got to have it, yeah I need it, I'm addicted, yeah I'm fading fading)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
This is a beat with no words at first, its a blank painting
Exercising the mind, its brain strength training
It starts off something like, "Shady's an insane maniac
Yeah, Slim Shady, that's a zany name, ain't it?"
Now all you need's an image to go with the name, baby
Wifebeaters and white t-shirts, Hanes mainly
It's a long shot, but is it possible? There's a lane, maybe
If not he's gon' have to come and change the whole game, ain't he?
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it, he can see his name up in lights
Women screaming his fucking name, fainting
Shady did it, he sold out the whole dang stadium
Joe Shmoe made it, he took his Plain Jane lady
And his baby Hailie out the trailer but he ain't trailing anymore
He's ahead of the race, while maintaining his innocence
Little does he know his train is derailing
And he's about to be raped by this game anally, now

[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
What would you do for a little bit?
What would you give for a little bit of that C-O-C-A-I-N-E?
I got to have it, yeah I made it, I'm addicted, yeah I'm fading
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Youre operating on all cylinders, syllables spit like dillingers
Spilling your guts, people are feeling your mic skills
But these haters are ice grilling ya
Willing to sacrifice anything for the life that they might steal from ya
Fake friends will kill for ya, die for ya but you cant decipher
Why for the life of ya, it wasnt like this when you were cyphering
Argue with your wife again, she found Vicodin
In your pants last night again, your dispute's public
Nothing is private anymore, oh, and your best friend?
Say bye-bye to him, what kind of apple you take a bite of Slim?
(But this is what you wanted Marshall, ain't it?) Fuck no!
The way that it turned out was nothin' like the picture that I painted
In my head, sometimes a dream and making it's more fun
Than it's to actually make it, the game stripped me naked
It robbed me of ever having another real relationship
With another girl, this world is a fucking trip
As I slip in another world, proceed, take another hit
Sniff 'til I fucking hurl, tell 'em all to fucking sit
And spin 'til they fucking twirl, middle finger up again
Relapsing back in this game, oh well, fuck it then, now

[Hook]

[Bridge: Jazmine Sullivan]
You start off bright, just to see your name in lights
Just so you can live the life
You take a bite and lose your sight, they call this (fame)
You think you're good, just cause you got out the hood
Concerned only with getting dough, no longer poor
But you lost your soul, they call it (fame)
I hear it callin', my name is callin'
Why you struggling when you could be ballin'?
My head is saying yes but my feet is stallin'
So many walkin' by the end they fallin'
But I gots to have it, like Eve and the apple
She had to grab it, I got to take it, I got to make it
That's the plan and I can't forsake it, yeah

[Hook]



(grunting)
(ringing tone)
Oh, answer the phone you fucking slut transvestite
With a cock, you're a man, aren't you?
You're a fucking man
(Hello?) Oh, hey
Um, is this, uh, I'm looking for a sensual, I don't know
Bodyrub, or something (Uh-huh, that's what I do)
Listen, what type of bodyrubs, like
I'm looking for like, um, I don't know, like
A cock massage... You know what I mean? (Right)
Like something like, I'm kind of, like
I don't know, I'm sure you do this everyday
Um... I'm just- I don't know, I'm looking for something like
My wife, my wi- I'm married, um
My wife does not satisfy me the way that you could



[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro]
'Cause some things just don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name
Some want a bigger stage
They came to see you spit your game, whoa
But it shouldn't be difficult to explain
Just why you came back again
You hate the fame, love the game
Cold as ice you remain, fuck 'em all
Tell 'em all eat shit, here we go again

[Ad-Libs]
God damn!
Is it that time again already?
Haha, okay
Y'all dont look too happy to see me
Fuck, man
Dont everybody welcome me back at once
All right
Fuck yall then!

[Verse 1]
You can get the dick, just call me the ball sack, I'm nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch, dogfall back, you mutts!
Fuck your worms, you've never seen such a sick puppy
Fuck it, a sick duck, I want my duck sicked, mommy
And my nuts licked, gobble 'em up trick, yummy
Bitch, you don't fuckin' think I know that you suck dick, dummy?
You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit, honey
Yeah, I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny
Shorty, dance, while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah, struck a nerve, sucker
Motherfucker, might as well let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, 'cause I'm just a mean cocksucker
The shit is on 'cause you went and pissed me off
Now I'm shittin' and pissin' on everybody
Give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So puff the Buddha, light a bong, but take a look at Mariah
Next time I inspire you to write a songcome on!

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth
Y'all are sittin' ducks, I'm the only goose standin'
I'll set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fuckin' around
Motherfucker, I'll show you pussy-footin'
I'll kick a bitch in the cunt 'til it makes a queef
And sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin'?
You musta mistook me for some sissy soft punk
Lookin' for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead, fuckin' hater, push me!
I told you ain't no fuckin' way to shush me
Call me a faggot 'cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up, sissy, G's up, all you gardeners freeze up
Put your hoes down, "Shady ease up!
Man, chill!" Nah, I can't, goddamn it, rap is a landfill
Drop the anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill
Shit, the day that happens the world will stop spinnin'
And Michael J. Fox'll come to a standstill
During a earthquake, urine in your face
'Cause you're fake (*lightning noise*)  Ow! What the fuck? That hurt, wait!
(*Lightning noise*) Ow! What the fuck? I just got struck by lightnin'
Alright then, I quit, God, I give up
Call it evil that men do
Lord, forgive me for what my pen do
"This is for your sins, I cleanse you
And you can repent, but I warn you
If you continue, to Hell I'll send you"
And just then the wind blew, and I said...

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

[Verse 3]
How long will I be this way? Shady until my dyin' day
'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
"So long," 'til then, I'll drop the fuckin' bombs
Like I missed the pass when I went long
If you don't like it, you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
"Oh, bitches don't like that," homie, I'll be nicer to women
When Aquaman drowns and the Human Torch starts swimmin'
Man, I'm a cold soul, I roll solo
So, don't compare me to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums, yeah
I'm bananas, pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with Auto-Tune
The last thing you want to do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say, "I was writing this and I thought of you," so

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

[Outro]
I don't know, I don't know what caused
I don't know what caused me to be this way
I don't know, I don't know
But I'll probably be this way 'til my dyin' day
I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold
Mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made me



[Skit]
Let's go!
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
*gunshot*



[Intro: Eminem]
Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady!

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Interlude: Eminem]
Okay, let's go!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Interlude: Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
They see that low rider go by, they're like, "Oh my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, "Sick 'em, Dre!"
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Interlude: Eminem]
And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent!

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick?
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, "Move," a bitch move

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust

But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
Cuz over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends

[Verse Two]
Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's son who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt lick my wonder cheese from under my nuts
They disgust, me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name n haters get murked
Bitches lust man they love me when I lay in the cut
Missed the cut the lady give a raidy some paper cut
Now picture us It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the shit gets worse and worse cause your soft
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

I venture to say with the same repetition is true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol The platinum duo's back on you hoes

[Chorus]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle

I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Verse Three]
It's sorta like pourin' Draino down a live volcano
You never know what'll happen next, it may blow
Same thing happens to the beats when Dre blows
I talk shit, but my dick's long as my payroll
I get ass like a ball player, but I'm a boss player
Pimpin' hoes from here to Australia
Till I get heart failure
Look at ya half of ya'll, all scared
Other half, hands up in the air, like "Awww yeah"
This is our year, this is what you call sheer talent
But I think at this point it's just obvious
Fierce, they say my music's good for all queers
Cuz I make your ear ring, get it?, piercin' all ears
Call us the Mafia, we got the fucking mob here
Gimme the hate and I'll feed off of ya's all year
Shit, I'm just doing my job here
You don't want no problem, do ya?
Fuck it, I'll even crack a bottle for ya

[Chorus]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?

[Interlude: Ca$his]
It's Mister Shady
Call for Ca$his

[Verse 2: Ca$his]
Six-four hoppers up at least four blocks
I crank my watch like I don't see no cops
Riding on a [?] six cars and [?]
No rims stop and stand up in the drop
[?]
I be chilling with the bitches, [?]
[?]
On my L.A. pad rooftop, ha, ha

[Chorus: Eminem]

[Interlude: Bobby Creekwater]
Yeah, so...

[Verse 3: Bobby Creekwater]
I'm at this party and notice that I didn't even get carted
Plenty lines, having fun, they see me and act retarded
I'm thinking to myself, "I'm a brand new artist"
I just started, tell me why I hit the ground and they parted
Feeling good
True stepping
I'm no number type, but gave me wood
[?]

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes

I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us

It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk



[Intro]
"Other man!"

I stand in slapped by the wind as I begin
Do you know who I am? And many reply with a grin
Yes, I'm tired of being obtruded
Why should I be secluded? I've got a brand new horn to be tooted
To sum it up in a nutshell, "Eminem will you kick it for me?"
So I find myself in a certain obligatory
A place that I dwell in, fell into some wonderful productions
To make up for lost time, and then it brings obstruction
Finally let loose, unloading the stockpile
A mental projectile, I aim at the reptile
I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this
"Why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus?"
Is there a reason for this? The hindrance is aggravating
How many times will it take you before you realize you're fading?
Fading from existence, cause simulations are dead
There's so much more to learn and pages left to be read
So put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor
While I hold the scrapbook that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor
Words can weigh a ton
Therefore it's never to fall into the hands of the wrong one

[Scratched samples] - "Yeah", "It's another

Very few have made an attempt to put in a foot on the other side
But I see no borderline, from under this colorblind
And some will probably never hold pieces of the sacred
But then I'm finally about to put an end to the hatred
Wrong, the world would never endure to arguing
Awaking to the absence of unity is startling
"Oh foolish pride, what the hell are you trying to do?
You cannot beat someone that's better than you so quit trying to"
Your echoing words that mean nothing are despicable
So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable
You're graceless, bland, you're tasteless and you're faceless faceless
Damn, you're dull it's time you faced this, here taste this
Straight from off of the pile, one of the numerous styles
The date of my birth on the Earth, the deliverance of a starchild
Blessed with formidable talent and versatility
But with such a power, there comes a responsibilty
To infringe on the boundaries, so now the defiance is clear
To form an alliance is something even the giants fear
So instead of being oblivious to the color of skin
Refusal of usin' is accepted now it's a trend

[Scratched samples] - "Yeah", "It's another..."

[Eminem]

You know I don't understand why we all just can't get along
You hate me but you know me and what I stand for
No. so then why do you speak for me
And every other white man when you that we're your enemy?

On the floor lies a broken door, cause I'm not to be spoken for
Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore
Rarely do you see the lighter side of me
I try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry
But ? is isolated, apologies are exhausted
Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted
Who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted
Switch to the opposite, now scenes are being re-enacted
Pull up that boy by his roots, destroy him quick
His fracture's obviating, we hate him, his patterns past us, huh
Always fighting for the position of top dog
That spot's already occupied, and I don't play leapfrog
Cause I do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine
But I'm always having to prove myself, time after time
Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast
Judged from the past and he's put last
And others with nothing to say
Stutterin' and slurrin' and mutterin' words with no meaning attack be signin' like Danny Kaye
Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin
And eat it like cheese, pass me the crackers please
I've got a craving



[Intro: Heart (Sampled)]
Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight
But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

[Verse 1]
Can't you see what you do to me, baby?
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane, I just go schizophrenic
One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
You make me crazy, the way we act
Like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits
And maybe that's a bad habit
'Cause the next day we're right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us?
We can't figure out if it's lust or it's love
What's that that's attractin' us to each other?
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you
Even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it, you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just 'cause I came home late last night
Crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's, baby
Because you stay with me, maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am
'Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your purse: little vibrators and dildoes
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
You're only twenty-four, but you're plenty more ma-ture
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still
You're crazy, sexy, cool, chill
And you play your position, you never step outta line
Even though I stay in your business you've always kept outta mine
I wonder what's on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time
I dotted your eye you ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

[Hook: Heart (Sampled)]
Go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

[Verse 2]
You are the ink to my paper, what my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber, the whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do, and the irony is you rely on me
As much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply: gas, the match, and igniter
The only way that I am able to stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel I don't need you as much
As I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
But you're essential to me, you're the air I breathe I believe
If you ever leave me I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall, you're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Hailie
You are the word that I'm lookin' for
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me
You're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much, too much is never enough
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

[Hook: Heart (Sampled)]
Go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you



[Intro]
A lot of people ask me stupid fuckin' questions
A lot of people think that what I say on a record
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody
That I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you
You know why? Cause I'm a criminal!
Criminal! You're goddamn right
I'm a criminal! Yeah, I'm a criminal!

[Verse 1]
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate fags? The answer's yes
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' (Ooh!)
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em!
"Hey, it's me, Versace! Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin' the mail, get it? Checkin' the male?"
How many records you expectin' to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
Come on, relax, guy! I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen! (A-men!)
"Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital"
Preacher, preacher! Fifth grade teacher!
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards (Duh)
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't-Give-a-Fuck still won't leave

[Chorus]
I'm a criminal!
Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal!
Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

[Verse 2]
The mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments, indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby, cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drank more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word
My morals went *thhbbpp* when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now, don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me: I'm white, blonde-haired, and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happenin' to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em-
-inem and Kim combined (The maniac's in)
In place of the Doctor cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place (Mm-mm-mmm!)
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you, Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal!

[Skit]
DRIVER: Aight look
EMINEM: Uh-huh

TELLER: Don't kill me!
EMINEM: Hurry the fuck up! {*Gunshot*} Thank you!

[Verse 3]
Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it (Go, go, go!)
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it and if anybody identifies
The guy in it, I hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask

[Chorus]
I'm a criminal!
Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal!
Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

[Chorus]
I'm a criminal!
Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal!
Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

[Outro]
I am a criminal!



[Intro]
A lotta people ask me stupid fucking questions
A lotta people think that what I say on record
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody, that
I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you
You know why? 'Cause I'm a criminal
You're goddamn right
Yeah, I'm a criminal
I'm a criminal

[Verse 1]
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez
Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate fags? the answer's "yes"
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Staring at my jeans, watching my genitals bulging
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em!
"Hey, it's me, Versace! Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checking the mail, get it? Checking the 'male'?"
How many records you expecting to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
Come on, relax guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen! (A-men!)
"Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital"
Preacher preacher! Fifth grade teacher!
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards
And to think, it's just little old me
Mr. "Don't Give a Fuck" still won't leave

[Hook]
I'm a criminal! 'Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal! But I don't got to say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep going, I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal! 'Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal! But I don't got to say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep going, I don't take shit from no one

[Verse 2]
My mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes, and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as-



[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Intro]
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha) Yo, mic check
(Woo, shit) Testing
One, two, um, twelve
What up? What up? What up? (Outsiderz)
This is my dance song, can you hear me? (Outsiderz)
(Rah Digga, Young Zee, bust it, bust it)
Alright, ayy, turn my headphones up

[Verse 1]
My favorite color is red like the bloodshed
From Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish kabab
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
(I can't stand white people)
You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so
Shit, I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent-minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit
'Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit (Um, one, two)
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
And gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list
You want to get high? Here, bitch, just sniff this

[Chorus]
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
'Cause I don't give a fuck like my middle finger was stuck
And I was wavin' it at everybody, screamin', "I suck" (I suck)
I go on stage in front of a sell-out crowd
And yell out loud, "All y'all get the hell out now"
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up, y'all, I'm sorry
(But Eminem, this is your record release party)
I'm bored out of my gourd, so I took a hammer
And nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket (I ain't got it all)
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage (Oh)
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit

[Chorus]
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)

[Verse 3]
Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
'Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'em I was Mike D
They was like, "Gee, I don't know, he might be"
I told 'em, "Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert" (Oh really?)
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster" (Okay)
Peace out (Bye)
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out
'Til I started bustin' freestyles, broke out
Then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect (Brrrt)
"It's Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?"
I want to make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember, when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset

[Chorus]
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)



[Curtains closing]

[Footsteps]

[Screech of microphone]

[Ken Kaniff]
Eeehhh, Is this thing on?
Where'd everybody go?
Guess who's back?
Back again
Ken is back... tell somemen
Rub my back, Rub my back, Rub my back, Rub my back
[Fading out]
Eh.Wait..Hello?
Eh..Goodnight



[Curtains open, followed by immediate applause of a crowd. Ominous piano music begins to play as curtains continue to roll back. Footsteps approach the mic, causing it to give off feedback. Eminem taps the mic, then clears his throat.]



*Crowd cheering*
*Eminem humming to himself*
*Checking mic*

We still on?
*Machinery starting*
Yo, is the mic on?
Check, check, check, aight, it's good, let's go, come on

*Machinery working*
*Cheering intensifies*
(Eminem, Eminem, Eminem!
Eminem, Eminem, Eminem!
Eminem, Eminem, Eminem!
Eminem, Eminem, Eminem!)



[Eminem & Sculptor]
(Hello?) Hello? (Yes)
Hi, is this Curtis (Yes, it is) Hi, Curtis
(Hi) Hi, this is Curtis, I'm Curtis
My name is Curtis also (Oh, my name is Kurt)
Oh, that's really funny (Okay)
(That's okay) Um, listen, I was wondering
I was looking at your ad in the paper, um
I was wondering, you-you, you do sculptures? (Yes)
Okay, um, you're gonna laugh, um
This is kinda personal, but
I'm, um, a transexual
And I was wondering if, um, you could-
Are you there? (Yes) Ok, I'm s-I'm sorry
I thought you was gonna laugh at me, um
I was wondering, um, how much would charge, to like, um
Sculpt, like-like, if-if-if you were to make like, um
A sculpture of my body (Well, that's not what I do
I work in the steel and...)
You couldn't make a-a sculpture of, like um
My body (*cellphone ring*) (No) Okay, um
(It's not what I do, I-ah) Okay, you're yelling at me
(No, I'm not) Oh, I'm-I'm sorry
I thought you were, I thought you were yelling at me
(My phone is louder) Oh, ok (But, uh)
It sounds very loud in my ear
(Just to be, make it very clear, what I do) Uhuh
(Is geometrics) Oh (So)
What exactly is geometrics? (Well)
Cause I was trying to get like, just-
All I really wanted- you're probably gonna laugh, but
All I really wanted was, um, a sculpture, really
Of my penis, just for my girlfriend (That's not what I do)
(I don't know what to tell you, but, uh)
You can't make a sculpture of my penis?
The- Just (It's not what I do, sir)
Just my penis, that's it, just the head of my penis
(No, that's not what I do) (*laugh*) (Okay?) What?
Why don't make sculptures of penises?
(Well) This is (it's-it's-it's not I'm in- First of all)
You're being mean, sir, 'cause you put an ad in the paper
(No, I didn't, I put an ad in fo-)
You put an ad in the paper for penis sculptures!
This is really messed up, you're doing psychological damage to me
Physically and mentally
(You know, I have your phone number, by the way
So don't make obscene phone calls) I'm not making obscene (*phone ringing*) phone call
I'm being dead serious with you sir (Well I can't do that)
And you're making fun of me (I can't do that for you)
Is that a business you run there? (I put an ad in for trucking)
You're scaring me, what? Trucking? (Yes, you looked under "trucking")
(I don't have an ad for-) I thought I looked under "fucking"
Oh my god, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, goodbye



[Intro: Matthew St. Patrick]
DMC, we have a mid-thirties male found down, unresponsive
Possible overdose, substance unknown
Pulse is 60 and thready
Respiration is eight
He's intubated and we're bagging him now
Uh, BP 90 over palp
Patient is cool, pale, and diaphoretic
Has aspirated, uh, GSC is 3
Will update en route, ETA: ten minutes

[Verse 1: Eminem]
As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene
To receive the drug addict trait
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate
Start off with the NyQuil, like, "I think I'll just have a taste"
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium
Like, "yeah, that's great"
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach 'cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face
"Mommy, something is wrong with Dad I think
He's acting weird again, he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating 3 Musketeers in the rear seat"

[Chorus: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like dj vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know
That's a lie 'cause I don't
And why, I just don't know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
"Maybe just a nice cold brew, what's a beer?"
That's the devil in my ear, I've been sober a fuckin' year
And that fucker still talks to me, he's all I can fucking hear
"Marshall, come on, we'll watch the game
It's the Cowboys and Buccaneers"
"And maybe if I just drink half
I'll be half-buzzed for half of the time"
Who's the mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rationale, man, I got half a mind
To have another half a glass of wine
Sounds asinine, yeah, I know
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch, look out for the wall, aim for the couch, I'm 'bout to fall
I miss the couch and down I go, lookin' like a bouncy ball
Shit must've knocked me out 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow, what the fuck happened last night? Where am I?
Man, fuck, am I hungover, and goddamn, I got a headache
Shit, half a Vicodin, why can't I?
All systems ready for take off, please stand by

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like dj vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know
That's a lie' cause I don't
And why, I just don't know

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So I take a Vicodin, splash, it hits my stomach, then (Ahhh!)
Couple of weeks go by, it ain't even like I'm gettin' high
Now I need it just not to feel sick, yeah, I'm gettin' by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die
Oh yeah, there's an excuse; you lose Proof, so you use
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
It's twelve-noon, ain't no harm in self-inducin' a snooze
What else is new? Fuck it, what would Elvis do in your shoes?
Now here I am three months later, full-blown relapse
"Just get high until the kids get home from school, homes, relax"
And since I'm convinced that I'm an insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep, so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium? Three?
And that will average out to about one good hour's sleep
Okay, so now ya see the reason how come he
Has taken four years to just put out an album, B
See, me and you, we almost had the same outcome, Heath
'Cause that Christmas, you know the whole pneumonia thing?
It was bologna, was it the methadone, ya think?
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos?
Your VCR tape cases, with your Ambien CR
Great places to hide 'em, ain't it? So you can lie to Hailie
I'm going beddy-bye, Whitney, baby; good night, Alaina!
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door
And wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn

[Chorus: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like dj vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know



I'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while I'm sleeping
I keep dreaming of death and I'm hearing people screaming
The devil's spirit's trapped inside me and I want it out
I'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house
With both of my wrists slit, I'm lifted up in the air
And suspended in animation like someone's holding me there
I feel somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck
While I choke on my own blood that I swallow and drown to death
But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
Nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes
Tripping over OD'd bodies of dead lushes
Bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes
Door's open and close by themselves
Books fly off shelves, curtains catch fire, the house melts
My skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters
The wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters
Caught a piece of shrapnel in the Adam's apple
Two cups of holy water and I'm looking at 'em half full
But as soon as I go to touch 'em they turn into red rum
It got silent, then all these voices said
"Come follow me into the gates of Hell"
I heard 'em yell "Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel!"
I ring the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother
Covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel
I said I need a room so I could try to get some rest
She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess
And told me that's just for starters, Satan'll be in to see me later
To see if I'm interested in being partners



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Girl, you give me writer's block, I'm at a loss for words
Uhh, my mind's as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours
How much that cost? That's what I call a Roethlissplurge
You drive me bonkers, Im about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' 'til I felt like Nas, the first
Date 'cause I think I gave you power
When I gave you flowers in a vase
A box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and Certs
Probably shoulda never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Shoulda been one of the first signs to cause alert
Man, we jumped in too fast
'Cause since then I just can't be apart from her
'Cause nobody's body's awesomer
I lust her and she loves me 'cause I'm popular
But you know this ain't love

[Chorus: Jamie N Commons and Eminem]
You know this ain't love, oh no (Oh this ain't love)
You know this ain't love (Oh this ain't love), oh no
What is it then?
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right) (Hey!)
(Wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight) (Hey!)
('Cause I give in at the sight of her)
And I here I go again

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You were obviously oblivious to me
I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from
The beginning, now I'm in disbelief, I
Never knew that this could be such misery, ah
'Cause now you see nothing but me
And I don't see nothing but you
And I'm about to flip 'cause we are  super glued in
We stuck to each other's hips and we can't
Do anything individually, which is to cling on
Scared to be alone, can't specifically describe it
I just can't seem to give a reason
That's definitive, just need ya
Talkin' about I live and breathe ya
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically
Addicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you
Don't wanna be with you neither
Bitch, put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek
'Cause this ain't love

[Chorus: Jamie N Commons and Eminem]
You know this ain't love, oh no (Oh this ain't love)
You know this ain't love (Oh this ain't love), oh no
What is it then?
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right) (Hey!)
(Wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight) (Hey!)
('Cause I give in at the sight of her)
And I here I go again

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Just want you to myself
Don't wanna share you with no one else
"What the fuck you whisperin' for?
You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it's time that we just split and leave the
Games behind, your frame of mind ain't the same as mine
I think you need to finish developing a
Little more mentally to get the picture."
That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the keys up
To the crib ever again, no Visa
Not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's
You better have an epiphany, slut
Guess what? (What?) The lease up
I'm just mad the time it took to discover
You were usin' me for loot like I used you for looks
Oh, thought you was too good for me, huh?
Yeah, toots, used to be my Carrie Underwood
I was your lumberjack
But I can't stomach this, I'm leavin' you, I'm not comin' back
She said, "The fuck with that!
Where's my Louisville Slugger at?"
She grabbed that fuckin' bat
And swung it at my head, I barely ducked and that's
Right when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice
Steel toe, girl probably coulda put a 100-yard field goal
Through the uprights

[Chorus: Jamie N Commons and Eminem]
You know this ain't love, oh no (Oh this ain't love)
You know this ain't love (Oh this ain't love), oh no
What is it then?
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right) (Hey!)
(Wants me to be that guy to her)
Lord, it's desperation (I can't even put up a fight) (Hey!)
('Cause I give in at the sight of her)
Desperation (And I here I go again)



[Intro]
Uh, uh, ha
Nah, fuck an intro, man, let's just go

[Verse]
I come around like what goes around, what goes up must come down
Anyone who comes up must go down, might as well go for the gusto now
Better not let up, better not let them breathe, last shot, give it all you got
Try to turn me down, bitch, get fucked with a volume knob, fuck all you snobs
Hoes, I hope all you rot
Two bottles of Lubriderm and a box of condoms
Is that all you brought? And you want a mnage  trois, you twats?
Fuck that, I'd rather turn this club to a bar-room brawl
Get rowdy as Roethlisberger in a bathroom stall, like a leech stuck in a vacuum y'all
Ain't nothing but a whole lot of sucking going on in rap, yeah, but I'm home
Bad to the bone, back in the zone, let him alone, you don't want to go eggin' him on
It'll never be my chair that you own
Crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain, no oxygen, other words, there's no heir to the throne
When I die so does hip-hop, Hitchcock of the shit, bitch ask Doc
Got it ziplocked in a bag, you fags ain't been able to fade me
Since Kid Rock had a high top, keep bloggin' while I mind-boggle
And I zone like I'm in the twilight, dog, get off my bone
This is my mic, doggonit; I like hoggin' it
Flow's so wet I'mma take this beat tobogganin', I'm waterloggin' it
I'm soggin' it, pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it
Suplexing it on cement
Like I'm on some "Straight Outta Compton" shit
Take this dick and chomp on it, I'm so bad I can bitch-slap a back-handed compliment
Jackass, eat a donkey dick, the game I just about conquered it
Like Donkey Kong, I'm bonkers, bitch, I'm the king of this honkey shit
I reign supreme in this honkey shit, no sense screaming and arguing
Makes no difference whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamer's the car you in
You think you ball? Well, I palm it, I throw up bombs when I vomit
Boy, I throw down in the kitchen, might hit your mom with my omelette
But you got egg on your face, now watch me drop an atomic
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze, bitch, I'm as batshit as Ozzy
It's obvious, you can tell right off the bat
No pun intended, but come any closer, I'll bite off your head
Tryna give me the finger's kinda like giving a spider the web
I'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage
I'll catch a fly in that bitch, you think you fly, you just food
I give as much of a flying fuck as that Superman dude
Guess I just do what you can't do and make you look stupid and bamboozled
Confused as usual and you can get whipped, she can open a can too
But you better hope you can handle the heat or stay the fuck outta Hell's Kitchen
I came to cock block like a square fucking male chicken
Yeah, it's Shady, slut, the rest can suck on a big one
'Cause I'm as despicable as Daffy Duck when I'm spittin'

Uh
I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise

It's simple as the alphabet, he F with me
That G shall surely see, he definitely as 'bout it
As retail fraud, he's weak, the honest gesture
The trigger finger round the diamond tester, we tell flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' round shootin' my biopic in my autobiography Range Rover
This ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' make-up, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagles'll air his coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My pair'll shoot, like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life; call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent-free (Real talk!)
I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea (That's Nickel)

All he know is pitfalls, that's why he always climbin' out his drop

Boy, I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
Hundred percent cut; no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit, where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man, them bullets will still be at your ass firin' (Brr, brr)
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy, I hit the beat, and just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self-made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy, so I put my dog in the 'Vette (Swerve)
Ahh! Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
If the ball in my hand, then the ball in the net (Net)
Bitch, I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me (Me)
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me (Me)
I'm over-respected
My mama gated community's overprotective
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway
Now my closet fifty shades of grey
26, and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church, tryna get a little savings, yeah, a coupon (God)
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Takin' down my number, like, "You still ain't got a new line?"
(You still ain't got a new line?)
Nah, it's the same, we been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months
But fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach, with dreams of bein' a Beatle
Don't want to, I need to, ya gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place
Where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel (Let's go,) lil' bitch!

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D
Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
If you think your hood harder, then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller
If the blicka hit ya kisser, bet yo' ass not rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissorin'
So, nigga, I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
Have K's in front of your school, but I ain't goin' to Kettering
Cough up a lung, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross-eyed like Bernsteins son
Any nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Lately it seems as if it's me against
The world, like it was before my life became a movie and they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like a refill of
Painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
Ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radioeat a dick!
I still never ABC this shit
Mainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' these streets
I swear that I would stay here still
And if I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here
And take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from
On a rampage too crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch?
Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's ragin' and heated and
On the way to go beat his kid?
On a track get spanked like he just did
(Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like we ain't shit
But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features and them cyphers on BET, cause if
I wasn't me I prob'ly wouldn't
Wanna play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' its fever pitch
Hundred and eighty degrees in here
Shoulder blade full of cedar chips
MC's just bit off more than they can chew
Like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and geniusness inconvenience
And for the record, you don't want this type of static
In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it
May consider tryna reinsulate your windows
May be in for another crazy winter
Cause so cold in the D, it is
As days begin to tick away, but ain't this really
What made me into the angry bitter blonde?
But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs?
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this pit
May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit
Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with you, but ain't shit changin'
It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter
With a potato peeler
And mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
Or the Bermuda Triangle and
Attempted to make a safe descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here? And if they mention us

Detroit! Okay!



[Verse: Eminem]
You know it's devil's night
The way that I smash the face of a punk in
Mask of Jason is a fashion statement since Drunken
Master tapes been a basket case
And if that's the case, then I'm dunkin'
Fascination with masturbation and humpin'
Lacerations and masking tape
And I'm bumpin' some Masta Ace
Roll up posin' as pastor Mase at a luncheon
See Andrea Yates, grab her face, then I'm punchin'
Crack her fuckin' skull with an antique vase, kill her husband
To the back of the station wagon
She's dragged and placed in the trunk and
Now I'm wanted for kidnappin', rape, and abduction
Spread her legs like Land O'Lakes that I'm cuttin'
'Til every fuckin' limb's either amputated or punctured
Decapitated Christina Applegate and I rap like I'm agitated
No chill, but I'm half sedated
A functioning addict  wait, I'm in London?
Brains underwear? A pantywaist, classic case of disfunction
Aggravated assault, it was rap related, you activated a gunman
This game's over-saturated with junk and
You punks couldn't get a hit from a database with a thumbprint
Razors and matches, path is laid for destruction
Put Jason Mraz's face in his ass
Then I'm snatchin' Anne Hathaway
She scratchin' like Jam Master Jay on the one's and
Two's, I slash away, then I'm dumpin'
Her ass in a Lake Placid for alligators
After I use the fuckin' tire thumper to bash her brains in for nothin'
The murder weapons, I stash 'em away on Runyon
Man, the kind of balls that it has to take and the gumption
Lack of class displayed, but such a vast array in abundance
Of sad disgraceful and bad distasteful redundance
And, bitch, I'm hung like candy canes if you're wonderin'
Balls come at you like batting cages
I'm raw like Big Daddy Kane is, I'm comin'
Like I'm ejaculatin' and nuttin'
Come catch the clap like you're patty-cakin', lil' dumplin'
Or brace yourself like a cast and be the last to make an assumption
I'm back like I'm in the bathroom takin' a dump and
It's back in the day or somethin'
I'll shit on you, Devil's Night  how's that for a introduction?



[Intro: Kobe]
Just so you don't die alone

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I roll over and go to reach for you, you're gone
This bed's empty without you
You said you're moving on
But I'm having some trouble getting there
But dwelling ain't getting me, uhh, anywhere
Fuckin' Valentine's Day
Fuck February, stuffed teddy bear, guts everywhere
Machete on the floor, I smashed up every mirror
Yeah, how do I look?
You fuckin' just left me here to die didn't you?
Why didn't you respond yet?
I've written you five or six different times and
I'm gettin' sick and tired of always apologizing to you
I didn't do shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through
This couldn't be true, we can't be over
So violets are blue, roses are red
Why is it everything I do I'm reminded of you?

[Chorus: Kobe]
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said, "Honey, I'm back"
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Guess I gotta deal with the fact that, you ain't never comin' back
Now every woman that I look at I'm lookin' for you
So I'm findin' something the matter with them
Excuse to not see anyone
Useless, rather pick up the phone, not at all, followin' protocol
I get bold like bowling balls
Grow balls and go to call to talk, forget what I want to say
Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman
I'm sick of playin' these games, I can't handle this heartbreak
It's makin' me wanna blow out my brains
Like birthday cake candles
Hang up the phone and I shake, I think I may have made a mistake
Can't escape the madness
Turn the radio on, I hate this sad song
But I can't even change the station
The same one's playin' on eight channels
I lay awake in shambles, I'm startin to hallucinate
I'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes
In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I

[Chorus: Kobe]
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said, "Honey, I'm back"
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

[Bridge: Kobe]
Give me one more, bottle for the pain
Give me one more for the memories
Give me one more, I'll make it taste like a steak
It'll help alleviate
It'll soothe this ache
Of trying to fake
That she's really, she's really coming back

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And it's been a while now, but I finally realize how
Much reality sucks, but it's just something about our love
I'm still in denial now, dealing with the finality of
And it's making me crazy thinking of the days we, spent
And how I'll never hold you again
And there ain't shit I can do about it
Now my head is overcrowded
With these clouded memories and I can't seem to get you out it
And how the fuck do you sleep comfortably
Knowing what you done did to me, huh?
Did it even occur to you that I loved you?
Completely, deep, and madly head over heels for you?
Was you and me, once used to be together forever
It was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream
We was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much
When I sleep I wake up dead, must be why I

[Chorus: Kobe]
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said, "Honey, I'm back"
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone



[Verse 1: Eminem]
They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me?
Or am I just a little snappy and they genuinely care?
Dudey, most of my life it's just been me and you there
And I continuously stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to, but I do
Yeah, I say it now when you can't hear me
What the fuck good does that do me now?
But somehow I know you're near me in presence
Oh, I went and dropped some presents off for Easter
To them two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their
Minds a little, and dog, you'll never believe this
But Sharonda actually talks to me nowJesus!
And everyone else is just tryin' to pick up the pieces
Man, how could you touch so many fuckin' lives and just leave us?
They say grievance has a way of affectin' everyone different
If it's true, how the fuck I'm s'posed to get over you?
Difficult as it sounds

[Chorus: Obie Trice]
Dudey, I drop a tear in a rhyme
The day you find it is the day I stop missin' DeShaun
Holton, it was written, it was woven
For a soldier to leave so suddenly, got me wide open
How could God take a soul so dope and
Turn around, leave us all heartbroken?
Know that you're sayin', "Keep goin'!
Be a man! No emotion! It's your duty!"
Until we meet again, dudey

[Verse 2: Eminem]
"dudey," that's what we'd call each other
I don't know where it came from
But it just stuck with us, we was always brothers
Never thought about each other's skin colors
'Til one day we was walkin' up the block in the summer
It was like 90 degrees, I was catchin' a sunburn
Tryin' to walk under the trees just to give me some comfort
I'm moanin', I just wanna get home and
I look over and your shirt is off
I'm like, "You're gonna fry," you're like, "No, I won't
I'm black, stupid! And black people they got melatonin
In their skinwe dont burn," meanwhile my face is glowin'
And I feel like I'm on fire
And the entire time you're just laughin' at me
And snappin' at me with your shirt, bastard
And I still have to get you back for that shit
And by the way, them Playboy rings my mother stole from you
Well, Nate finally got 'em back, shit
It must've been at least sixteen years ago
Well, I put 'em in your caskoww
Movin' past it, it still ain't registered yet
But you can bet, your legacy they'll never forget
The Motor City, Motown, hip hop vet
Hip Hop Shop, dreads, it don't stop there
Yeah, as difficult as it sounds

[Chorus: Obie Trice]
Dudey, I drop a tear in a rhyme
The day you find it is the day I stop missin' DeShaun
Holton, it was written, it was woven
For a soldier to leave so suddenly, got me wide open
How could God take a soul so dope and
Turn around, leave us all heartbroken?
Know that you're sayin', "Keep goin'!
Be a man! No emotion! It's your duty!"
Until we meet again, dudey

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And this might sound a little strange but I'ma tell it
I found that jacket that you left at my wedding
And I picked it up to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass
And hang up in the hallway so I can always look at it
And as for all me and D12 we feel like "Fuck rap!"
It feels like our general just fuckin' died in our lap
We shut off all our pagers, all our cell numbers is changed
Our two-ways are in the trash
So some cats will have to find a new way
And I know it feels like the dreams will die with you today
But the truth is they're all still here and you ain't
Purple Gang, you gotta keep pressin' on
Don't ever give up the dream, dog, I got love for you all
And dudey, it's true you brought people together
Who never woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
You were the peacemaker, dudey
I know sometimes you were moody
But you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
But you was down for yours whenever it came to scrappin'
If it had to happen, it had to happen
Believe me, I know you're the one who taught me to throw them bows back on Dresden
From eggin' cars to paintballin' and gettin' arrested
To sittin' across from each other in cells, laughin' and jestin'
They tried to hit us for five years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up didn't show up for court, so we got off on a technicality, left sweatin'
Me, you and what's his face? I forgot his fuckin' name
Shame he even came to your funeral, he betrayed our team
And if I see him again I'ma punch him in the fuckin' face
And thats on Hailie Jade, Whitney Laine and Alainas name
I'll let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot
In the air for you and pour some liquor out
With Obie in the parking lot of 54 just before
We were supposed to get in cars to come and see you once more
Difficult as it sounds

[Outro: Obie Trice]
Dudey!



[Eminem]
Good morning children!
My name is Dirty Steve, I'll be your substitute teacher for today
(Clinton Sparks!)

Come with me, don't be so mad, angry little man
Dirty Steve will be here soon, he will hold your hand
Walking through the forest, he will show you porno mags
You can beat his dick while he sucks yours, cuz he's a fag



[Verse]
Come here spittin' with non written, non-fiction
Rappers try to step to this with no prediction
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm smashin' and bashin' and crashin'
I hate rappers with a passion when I'm chilling with DJ Fashion
Yo, I need a frickin' Kleenex
Or I die like River Phoenix when I'm chilling with Phoenix
With two Coronas, I'm on the microphone
And I'ma own this, yo, and I'ma bone this in Arizona
Yo, rappers that ain't able
That can't stay stable, I'm on two turntables
With my man, but he doesn't matter 'cause he kicks lyrics galore
And he's only five foot four
Yo, check it out, I bust rhymes and get groovy
My man got carded at a rated R movie
But it really didn't matter, he wasn't insulted
He said "I'm 27 years old,o, I'm an adult kid."
But yo, still Slim Shady gets ill
With the skill and I'ma always build and kill
My baby's mama just to piss the world off
Just to piss the girl's off, yo, I hurl off
The top of the building, kill women and children
And then it hit me, suddenly my wrist tried to slit me
Couldn't believe it, yo, y'all couldn't conceive it
It's Slim Shady, I'll fuck a girl in her cleavage
Bleep that out and you can keep it, just bleep it
Yo, y'all keep it a secret, I'm top secret
Like Pop Secret, rappers, they don't wanna see
Slim Shady, I'm from the motherfuckin' D



[Intro: Eminem + Hailie]
Hailie, what do you want to be when you grow up, baby?
I don't know, but I don't want to
Grow up to be like Ja Rule's little dirty-ass kids
Ha ha, yeah, c'mon
G-G-G-G-G-G-G Unit
Hailie, come here, baby! Bring Daddy his Oscar!
We're gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass

[Verse 1: Swift]
I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple
I'm quick to murder ink with lead
And I ain't talking 'bout a pencil
Look at what the fuck you done got into
I see you found your niche, you just a bitch with a menstrual
Claiming you a murderer, and you spelled it wrong
You put E before the D, cause that's all you on
You on Pac's dick, you a replica guy
If he was still alive, you would never get by
All you do is cry, bitch, keep it real
Life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins three deals
That another nigga got you? They didn't see skills
And I ain't playin', you a brother getting cheated
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover, cause he need it
And all you niggas hating, shut your mouths!
It's just that real niggas ain't buying that shit y'all put out

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Doe, rae, me, but we don't sing, motherfuckers
So Murder Inc, do your thing, motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team
Who expects nothin' less than R&B coming from that regime
"Regime" is a little extreme
Neck and neck with soldiers, motherfuckin' Marines
Ja sold his soul to sing
Weave eye-witness team on the TV screen, chase the greed
Now that you've embraced the green
Don't fuck with the triple beams
You's a motherfuckin' actor, slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billie Holiday  how it happen?
Artist and repertoire saw him in action
Pac assassination, Def Jam grabbed him
Told him, "Reenact him, you go platinum!"
They seen it for sure, I know that Afeni Shakur
Don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins reenacting her boy
So I'm click-clackin' this toy, mash and destroy
Shady slash Aftermath and Detroit, motherfucker!

[Hook: Eminem]
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me cause you washed up, lost your spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Don't hate me, I'm too hot and you're not
Shooting at me, with the only shot you got
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
Now, we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs
To the grievance and the crying and the intimate hugs
We don't take you serious, nigga, you shook
You half of a half-way crook; get off X dick, go sing a hook!
Nigga, and you can't replace the late great one
And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga, please stick to the script
Before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino, you ain't shit but a bitch!
Fuckin' old-ass, ignorant, innocent-lookin' senior citizen
Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive
Wait a minute, hold on: is it me, or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on?
A bitch-made man; now, how you gonna connect
With them short ass arms, like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream, holler and curse
Go ahead and respond
And pull that pen and pad up outta your purse

[Verse 4: Proof]
Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up, Gotti? And this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for stepping on bush stones
What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggas?
Roll like a boss, in the streets they still feel us
It's real business, y'all ain't caught the concept
You talking nonsense to walking bomb threats
Contact was blown by Benzetta in The Source
Threaten at the boss, you gon' see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But Detroit niggas early and ain't scurred to bust

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Word to my nigga Bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Cadillac Pac or that transvestite?
That dress like a Lil Kim fox
You're just like a little windbox
Press tight on the trigger of this Glock
Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat
You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying mock Pac
You Mockaveli; get your own identity!

[Hook: Eminem]
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me cause you washed up, lost your spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Don't hate me, I'm too hot and you're not
Shooting at me, with the only shot you got
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

[Over hook]
Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again
Fuckin' punk-pussy bitch! I'll fuck you up, boy! Never!
Don't you never in your motherfuckin' life
I'll choke the shit out of you little motherfuckin' midget
Hailie'll whip your motherfuckin' ass

[Outro: Obie Trice]
That's right, motherfuckers
Shady records, what you know about it?
Fuck Benzino! Fuck Ja Rule!
Nigga, this Obie Trice right here talkin' to you motherfuckers
Ja Rule punk ass, yeah, fuckin' Soul 4 Real ass
Nigga, that's Soul 4 Real
That the nigga from Soul 4 Real!
Candy Rain-ass nigga, he got a deal, now he rappin'
You don't know what's, faggot-ass motherfuckers
Get money to all my real niggas, man
Obie Trice, D-12, G Unit, 50 Cent, Hailie Jade

[Outro: Hailie and Eminem]
Daddy, is Ja Rule taller than me?
No, honey, you guys are the same size



[Monologue: 50 Cent]
Yoooo!
This is the invasion
I'll beat you motherfuckers, and get invaded
Shady Records, Aftermath
Get down and pray

[Skit/Background: Eminem]
"Eminem..."
"No..."
"Eminem!"
"No..."
"Hahaha. Wake the fuck up, motherfucker."
"What do you want from me?!"
"Hahahaha. Remember me?"
"I killed you!"
"You thought I was dead, didn't you?"
"What do you want from me?!"
"I'm alive..."
"Oh, God..."
"Get up."
"No."
"Get up and look in the mirror."
"I don't want to!"
"Look in the mirror, it's just a reflection. Haha"
"Leave me alone!!!"
"Look in the mirror! You're nothing! You're nothing without me! Look in the motherfucking mirror!"
"Leave me alone!!! Leave me the fuck alone!!!"
[Eminem punches the mirror, breaking it.]



(Ed. Note: Please help finish transcribing.)

[Verse 1]
Livin' like a sleuth
... ingenuity
... voraciously ... acuity
...

[Hook]
But don't chew with your mouth full
Don't chew with your mouth full
Cause if you chew with your mouth full
You'll end up biting your toes

[Verse 2]
...
Tossin' curves that are nerve-wrackin'
[Irv?] slackin' I'm throwin' pitches uh switches
Which is trickery, victory's repetitious
Though weaker ones and overeager ones that just get ate up
Though many will often try to duplicate the style I made up
If my weight up it wouldn't matter, you're slow as a paraplegic
Whoops you missed, here's my fist, eat it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
...
Frostbite

[Verse 4]
You take out crews by yourself take out this one
I'm a soloist chaos is a soloist pick one
He's about to put more tracks in your soul
And put your crew in a pile and jack em up like a totem pole
I give you a dance and make you change direction or
Have a spot reserved in a handicapped parking section
How the hell can you leave when your trainless?
Your smooth sailing hit a storm and looks likes your failing
Left a band stranded empty handed
Put so much as a toe in my way and get branded
I'm standing colossal drag you out like a fossil
With a rap so hot it will cause a snot in your nostril
Take you out take you out with simplicity
I'm shocking so bad I'll make you shit electricity
Try flip me or whip me you fucking fed bon appetite eat the concrete dick head

[Hook]

[Outro]
...
When will he ever learn?
I guess never



[Verse 1]
Used to get bent, now I represent to the fullest
Pencil is full of insolent bullets
I'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pitbull and a Rott'
Mixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken
I begin to spittin' like vintage Pac
Demented, demonic, sinister
Ever since the Doc' replenished me
The day he gave me that shot when I was just about to quit
So to not see him with me would be a shockin' image
And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
And knock me to the canvas, even the boxin' critics
Know that if I get off to a rocky start, I'll always have a Rocky finish
Eat me brocoli, spinach, cocky? Nope
But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at
This and put emphasis on the "dope"
So when names come up, in that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow
You won't find anywhere
When it fires and I unload, my pen explodes
'Til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
Let insults fly every 60 seconds that go by, so you know I meant it
In school I was so shy, timid
Two pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member
Beggin' my mom for K-Mart MacGregors
Cause they were new, St. Vincent de Paul
Those Pony's were used, and no size fitted
But kissed them old days, adis, I did it
They said I was a gimmick
Now I'm the one that those guys mimic
Now you fuckers don't wanna go startin' no argument
Cause you know I'll win it
Name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front

[Hook: Buckshot]
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid

[Verse 2]
Rest in peace to Big Proof
You was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me
Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowin' through me
I love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete
I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne
Better watch the fuckin' tone that you speak
Feel like I'm in the zone, I'm in a whole different league
On my motherfuckin' own, it's just me
No opponents can compete
And I've never been known to retreat
From beef, be beat, follow trends or wallow in defeat
I'm still hungry as fuck, but can't even say "Bon apptit!"
Cause I don't know what to eat
Fuckin' microphone or the beat
Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine
It's nose to the grindstone time, holmes, your mind's blown
Cause I rhyme like I'm still tryna get signed
Up in the Ebony Show-case
With Denaun screamin' "Who the fuck passed you the mic?"
Never asked you like my shit from the get
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
You had you a nice run, now take a hike
I ever meet my match, I'ma strike that bitch first
Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers
The real rappers get their mothafuckin' skills crackin'
Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not?
You don't like it? Suck a cock! Almost forgot
Before I signed with the Doc, I almost signed with Duck Down!
Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers, so mothafuck Loud
They jerked me around, so what's up now?
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like
Rubbin' it in and holdin' some grudge now? But don't front

[Hook: Buckshot]
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid

[Verse 3]
Late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write
Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe
But wear diapers, cause you might leave a streak
I'm on a streak, windshield wipers couldn't wipe
It's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump in tonight
Cause I'm hyper or somethin'
Needin' someone or somethin' is lightin'
This fire under me, it's breathin' new life
It's like I already died once
I guess some people only live twice, and it's funny
My days of being broke were so long ago
I lost all concept of money
But you dimes won't get a fuckin' nickle from me
Oh shit, I'm down on one knee
I'm havin' a stroke of geniusElizabeth, I'm comin' to you, honey
From boy to man
And still make a whore moan, like a thyroid gland
I'm in another category, man
Don't group me up with them pop stars
I never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy, band
No offense? Yes offense
Precedents has been set that'll never get met
Middle finger pressed against Moby's nose
Shouts to Obie, the curtains closed on my show
But never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it
You can't take it, oh
Got a whole generation of rappers comin' up
That are nutty with the flow, but convince me you've heard
An MC since me who's as good with the fuckin' mincing of words
Without mincing words that'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve
Who's mentally disturbed
You might as well stick a knife in me and turn
It'll be like my skin bein' Indian burned
Hah, bitch, there isn't one, when will you learn?
Never been served, if memory serves
I'd battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words

[Outro: Buckshot]
You know I got you open kid, stop frontin'
You know I got you open, Word Life...



[Intro: Eminem & Obie Trice]
Obie, yo
I'm sick
Damn, you straight, dog?

[Hook: Eminem (&  Obie Trice)]
That's why I ain't got no time (I think I got chlamydia)
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

[Verse 1: Obie]
Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk
I had a bag of the skunk, won in last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis, Denise from the cleaner's
Fucked me good, you shoulda seen this
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable
French roll stylin', body like a stallion
Sizin' up the figure, while my shit gettin' bigger
Debatin' on a fuck or do I wanna be her nigga?
Caressin' this bitch, plus I'm checkin' out them tits
Sippin' on that fine shit I ain't used to buyin'
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like takin' hoes' money, but that's another story
For surely the pussy on toast, after we toast
Her clothes fell like Bishop in Juice
The womb beater, clean pussy eater, insertin' my jock
In that spot hotter than the hottest block
"Don't stop!"the response I got when I was knockin' it
Clock's steady tickin', kinky finger lickin'
And can on, semen's at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga like a slave owner
When I dropped off my outfit she knew I wanted to bone her
She foamin' at them lips, the ones between the hips
Pubic hair's lookin' like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks
We in the final stretch, the last part of sex
I bust a fat-ass nut, then I woke up next
Like, what the fuck is goin' on here? This bitch evaporated
Pussy and all just picked up and vacated
And now I'm frustrated, cause my dick was unprotected
And doctor Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit (Fuck!)

[Hook: Eminem]
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now I don't wanna hit no woman, but this chick's got it comin'
Someone better get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me
To throw her off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
But what's she shovin' me for? Doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?
Man, I'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this whore
What would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce?
She's havin' another baby in a month and it's yours
And you found it isn't, cause this bitch has been visitin'
Someone else and suckin' his dick and
Kissin' you on the lips when you get back to Michigan
Now the plot is thickenin' worse
Cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse
So you're paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they told you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it
Then the doctor comes out, lookin' like Dennis the Menace
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby it's AIDS
He ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it
So you jet back home, cause you gon' get that ho
When you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo
Cause you love her, you never would expect that blow
Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleaner's
Bringin' me home diseases, swingin' from Obie's penis
She's so deceivin', shit, this ho's a genius, she G'd us

[Hook: Eminem]
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

[Outro: Eminem & Obie Trice]
I'm busy, yeah, fuck these bitches!
Fuck 'em all!
Get money, Shady Records
Ha, whoa!
Obie Trice! Eminem, motherfucker!
New millennium shit, yeah
Turn this shit off man, turn this shit the fuck



What I wanna do, let me see right here, yo

Not many people that I label
Would be able to display table
Manners but my plan this
To make this beat rock like scanners
And make the fans just go bananas
Yo, get our Planters
That means our nuts for the sluts who don't understand this
Yo, my clan is
Yeah right, and y'all gon' stand there
And act like you don't understand it
Like my name is Janet, my titty fell out and I ain't plan it
Check, check this out
And if you're rockin' with your necklace out
That's my breakfast now
I'mma snatch it, yo my style is rechid, you can't fetch it
No you can't stretch it
And yo, it doesn't really matter
Cause your name I can't even pronunciate
You're the sa-same type-a mo'fucker
To go and suckerpunch Dre at the Vibe Awards
But he right behind the boards the next day
So, kiss an ass
Or kiss a dick, lick a dick
Eat my ass
Whatever you wan' do, it's on you
Big Proof comin' through..



[Intro]
Yeah, boy
Them better ring the alarm, boy
Them know what's coming, boy
Buh! Buh-Buh! Haha
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh my God, fuckin' bumbaclot
I'm hard as Kenard, the little boy who shot Omar in The Wire
Tie a whore up with barbed wire, you're nothing but a brah, boy
I'm the real deal, and Charbroiler on the bonfire
And bon voyage, bitch, I'm like Chef Boyardee in this bitch
Send a bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for you, boy, you think you're Tom Sawyer
'Til I pull you out the fuckin' storybook and stomp on ya
Fuckin' fictitional characters and fairy tales
Prepare yourself for Captain America on Ferris wheels
But it ain't fiction, it's fact, boy, beware, it's real
Them lyrics you wield equal zero to a hero's shield
Mr. Fly by the seat of his pants parasail
Fall, hit the trampoline, bounce, and grab a pair of stilts
And I ain't wearing zilch, zip, zero, nothing; no, nada
Like your father fucking your mother

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on 'em
(Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me)

[Verse 2]
Boy, I'm the Real McCoy, you little boys can't even fill voids
Party's over, kids, kill the noise, here come the killjoys
Me and Dre the steel alloys, the rap Crown Royals
That scalp cowboys, now, how that sound for you?
Yeah, boy, you know we're about to put it down for you
So kick your shoes off in the foyer, have a sound voyage
And sayonara, see you fuckers tomorrow
Get some R&R and marinate in some marinara
And have a Coke and a smile, don't make me open a jar
Of whoop-ass on you, that's the last straw you're hopin' to draw
Yeah, you're fresher than most, boy, I'm just doper than all
Boy, I'm that boy, boy, them boys, them no up to par
I just show up, go up to the stage, and blow up the spot
There ain't no boy who can do what I do, boy, I'm a star
Boy, I told you, boy, I'm a soldier boy, I'm Deshaun
Holton in this bitch, I'm the Proof, boy, you're a fraud
I'll destroy you, boy, fuck around and blow you to sod
Oh my God, boy, you didn't go there, no, you did not
I got a whole storyboard for you, boy, you're the plot
You're gettin' got, whether you try to avoid it or not
Apology not accepted, boy, Detroit is a rock
We get to beefin', ain't no tellin' at what point it'll stop
All I got to do is point to the spot
When the bomb drops, boy, does it drop
And when it does, boy, there's a problem

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on 'em
(Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me)

[Verse 3]
Boy, don't jinx yourself, boy, I'm Micheal Spinks with the belt
Stringer Bell, boy, my name rings bells for itself
I'm sick as hell, boy, you better run and tell someone else
Bringin' hell, boy, sing 'em telegrams and get dealt
And to that boy on them sedative meds who said he was better
I bet he never seen Freddy in a black and red little sweater
Back, better than ever, the cheddar shredder, the grater
The beef grinder, I'll settle vendettas a little later
Givin' haters incubators, think you made a mistake
By saying Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the gate
You got one foot in the grave, just stay put and behave
I'm 'bout to turn this fuckin' place to Beirut in a day
So, hey, wouldn't you say I'm the shit?
Couldn't agree with you more
If you were to say that my fuckin' shit doesn't stink
Shady-fuckin'-Aftermath, boy, the ship doesn't sink
It just floats in the fuckin' water 'til we fill up the tank

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on 'em
(Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me)
Drop the bomb on 'em
(I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me)



[Intro: Eminem & Dina Rae]
Yeah, haha, whoo, shit
Aight, guess what? I ain't comin' in yet
I'll come in a minute
Ayo, this is my love song, it goes like this

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark (Fuckin' faggot!)
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinnin', you're beginnin' to think women
Are swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink, then in
A couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me outta this place, I'm outta place
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so

[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]
Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
In third grade, all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's Cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude
Schemin' on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game, and every face looks the same
They've got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy's got me standin' next to you
Gettin' sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like, "Yo, what the fuck we'd do?"
I gotta go, bitch, you know I got stuff to do
Cause if I get caught cheatin', then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run, these drugs are probably
Gonna catch up sooner or later, but fuck it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around lookin' like some wind-up dolls
Shit's stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more

[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]
Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend?
Screw it! And what's a little bit of alcohol poisonin'?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow, you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feelin' like shit every mornin'
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still got a lotta growing up to do
I still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done, I'll be forty
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysittin' for Hailie while Hailie's out gettin' smashed

[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]
Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]
Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

[Outro: Eminem]
Drugs really got a hold of me
Really got a hold of me
These drugs really got a hold of me
They really got a hold of me



[Dr. West]
"Morning, Marshall."

[Eminem]
"Morning, doc."

[Dr. West]
"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"

[Eminem]
"Ah, anxious."

[Dr. West]
"Anxiety?"

[Eminem]
"Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous."

[Dr. West]
"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now
You're sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this
You found a sponsor yet?"

[Eminem]
"Um, not yet. But I mean, when I get back..."

[Dr. West]
"Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't."

[Eminem]
"Well, yeah, I mean I gotta start going to meetings first and...
Wait, what?"

[Dr. West]
"Well, I mean you don't absolutely have to go to meetings
I mean it's not like... a requirement
If they fit into your schedule, I know you're a busy person."

[Eminem]
"Well, yeah, but I thought sobriety was the most important thing?"

[Dr. West]
"So what else are you thinking?"

[Eminem]
"Um, well, I know I gotta start practicing the steps, and
I mean, learn 'em, and start being able to apply 'em."

[Dr. West]
"The steps?"

[Eminem]
"Yeah, the steps."

[Dr. West]
"There's a lot of them, aren't there?"

[Eminem]
"Well, twelve, but"

[Dr. West]
"Christ, I don't even know them all."

[Eminem]
"Really?"

[Dr. West]
"Anything else?"

[Eminem]
"Um, well, I mean the only other question I have is, like
What do I do if I find myself in a situation where
Maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that
And I get tempted to"

[Dr. West]
"Take a drink."

[Eminem]
"What?"

[Dr. West]
"Take a drink, and y'know, take the edge off."

[Eminem]
"Take the edge off? Man, if I have a drink I already know what that's gonna lead me to."

[Dr. West]
"What, you mean these?" *shakes pills*

[Eminem]
"No, what the fuck?!"

[Dr. West/Slim Shady]
"Marshall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts, are we? Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall
We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall? Marshall!!

[Eminem]
"Oh no, no, no! Come on, man!
Oh, fuck you, man!
No, no, no, NO!"
*Alarm beeps*
"Oh, shit!"



[Intro]
All aboard!
Okay, next stop, my basement (Ha-ha)
I'll meet you down there!

[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He'd say, "What if you went platinum?", I'd just laugh at him
"That's not happening, that I can't fathom"
Eighty-some million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Verse 1]
Haters getting mad, they done had enough of Shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touch me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Whoopsa-that-a-fucking-daisy
Thats a no-no, even she knows Da-Da's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cuckoo, bananas, fucking-A, B
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's 'cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen, man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brain's all haunted 'cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters, turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I oughta just be honest, but

[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He'd say, "What if you went platinum?", I'd just laugh at him
"That's not happening, that I can't fathom"
Eighty-some million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Verse 2]
"Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad when I call them both faggots"
All these fucking voices in my head, I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up 'fore I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason, slash, Leatherface, and
Together makes 'em a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the Wiener Schnitzel up his ass, hopped away, some-
-body please stop the patient, get the cops to mace him
Homie, I'm the Scheie, ask Doctor Dreson
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away, son
No, not a-now, not a chance, not today, son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussies queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to wipe up the crap stain, feck it
I'll just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He'd say, "What if you went platinum?", I'd just laugh at him
"That's not happening, that I can't fathom"
Eighty-some million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Verse 3]
Elevator in my house, hah, smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in the microwave, I'm
Thinking 'bout an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbors step away, then I just pepper-sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hide out, drive by my house and beep
Like, now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down fucker (bah), try counting sheep
And you're tryna find out why now there's beef
Mace in your face, bitch, cry now, pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above 'em just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement, yelling "Stop!"

[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He'd say, "What if you went platinum?", I'd just laugh at him
"That's not happening, that I can't fathom"
Eighty-some million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Outro]
You fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fucking-A, even got a bidet
To wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off, I can just toss a
Flying saucer in it, the shit's awesome
Yeah, fucking elevator, living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Intro: Big Trigger]
Yea Ya'll know what it is
Rap City presents Em360
Slaughterhouse, Eminem, Big Tigg, Just Blaze!
On the 1s and 2s, oh-oh

[Intro: Eminem]
Yo Tigg, get in the not booth
And spit the truth, to the young youth

[Verse 1: Big Trigger]
Aight, ay, Amex don't leave home without your cards
But this Hip Hop, so don't leave home without your bars
And for some of these rap stars, that's just too bad
Cause you can't bring out them bars, that you ain't never had
It's Eminem and Slaughterhouse, yeah you know we the truth
And ohh the game is out of order, since we closed the booth
Yes indeed original, beats the replacement cause
The back room will never be what the basement was

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
I'm the realest mo'fucker that I know
Wasn't always the case guess the figure had to grow
I do it for the love I don't do it for the dough
But I know these sucker figures will so they keep me on my toes
What's sad is I couldn't tell you what I'm hated for
And them painkillers didn't murder the pain they gave me more
These fans on my head now they say they want the old Joe
I grew up mature y'all can't see that this the old Joe
Want to see me lose every battle of depression
No matter what it do to me, no matter my regression
They want to see me fall, want to ruin my regiment from the start
Want to cut the beat off soon as I let em in my heart
I'd be the first to admit it, lost focus for a while
Sendin' unsolicited dick pics to dimwitted thick chicks
Was so high I lost track of my ways
Then I fell in love with a baby and got mad at her age
The way she act and behave, was it an act or a phase
How you trife when I gave you life
You was lacking in wage
You don't want say hi or speak to me
Bet you makin 200 dollars by weekly
Try to help the world out, bring some reparation
And forget being humble in a state of desperation
Ain't gotta ask what to help with no hesitation
And for me to deal with it I might need some meditation
I love you but its best we stay apart, segregation
And to cope with the feeling I might need some medication
Trust me I don't never want to see that side of Joe
It would kill us all slow, one reason I'm the realest mother-mother I know

[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9]
Its Nickle, riding round in that Maserati four seat
Symbol on the grill looking like Tony Stark's goatee
Best rapper alive and you know me
The most distinguished shooter that's coming up out of the D since Joe D
I take mines at lead point
At the risk of having to shave my garlic clove in a razor inside a fed joint
Hip hop is alive, but the rhymes died
Only fear I have is "world star" being yelled from my blind side
Don't get me wrong it ain't like I ain't never lost a fight
But these days I'm more like a lyrical artiste
I'm outlining everybody in chalk white
The off-beat deceased version of Dr. Narcisse
This ain't blueprint, your idolizing
You tryna jump fast that's foolish of you in my drunk past and handing me my pilot's license
That's plain stupid, your boy's a star
Sitting in that drop top fish bowl and the doors ajar
It's ironic I remember when I couldn't afford a car
And now it's back and forth
The black one or white one I call 'em Macklemore
And Lord Jamar, first we defyin' the odds
We not a group, we more like a circular firing squad
This not a booth, this is our house and we won't stop
We killed the cypher two times already
What you gon' give us an award
But we won't stop for shutting down the internet
Now tell ya momma hi, and tell Rihanna we ain't finished yet

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
When we step in that booth, that's when the flame enters
Best spit, make any set trip, yeah its the gang members
Waving that shady flag, navy jag
Matching the yank' fit, with the polo brief showing, due to the lazy sag
I'm in a crazy kind of place
I got this thing right on my waist that'll leave tears on your baby mommas face
So chill, I'm in a crazy kind of place, I got this thing below my waist
That'll leave kids on your baby mommas face, for real
The flow gets cracked, as it came in capsules
Your cap just started snapping
My starter caps was snapping
When cross color was cracking
And my cane was half full
With the half moon park, hope you rap dudes smart
Don't piss me off like the bathroom mop
You don't want it with me
If I'm throwing hooks at you, that don't mean the chorus for free
So save your jabs its way better
If I start throwing jabs I'm talking Zabs first three round against Mayweather
Yeah I'm a crook from the brook, that mastered how niggas shook turned notebook
Broke cook, I'm so dope look
Bring the beat back with no hook just bars
Just a thing of ours that make their pants drop, make em open up their bras
Move g-strings like guitars, that's nothing, that's something light
Like Riesling at the bar
Y-A-O-W-A, if y'all ain't saying Yaowa by now you got nothing to say
This like NWO vs NWA, y'all like the rockers versus the ROC
Full of nothing but Jays
Check the rocks its nothing fugaz'
But don't get stupid my Cooper clique will throw shots for a couple of days
Make it horny when we out, Amityville horror, y'all don't want it with the house

[Verse 5: Crooked I]
Slaughter season, y'all the reason
Real dudes I'm bringing some more in
Like a Polynesian
Sick with the llama squeezing
Bullets flew and the chopper sneezing
Got your body and legs torn, but before you was airborne
You was bob and weaving still getting hit till your nos' is weezing
They set you deep in your coffin sleeping
I'm gone off the deep end, I'm a wolf, this industry my sheep skin
I'm out here hunting with my ink pen
I'm living like a kingpin
Doing it for my g's in the pen
Dreaming about two-piecing a police chief's chin
You rappers something candy coated, I don't like suckers
I'm Iron Mike, I don't like Busters
You looking for em' fly dudes like Orville and Wilbur
You got the Wright brothers
No bright jeans, no bright colors
I'm the second coming, the one that Pac predicted
Islamic, Gnostic and Christian, the flow so godly you got to listen
I backed you in a dodge a minute
Like MC Eiht in a L.A. hat, these rappers straight tryna dodge a menace
I'm looking at your videos, look like your watching tennis
Brothers dressed like Maria Sharapova wearing yoga pants
Meanwhile Big Poppa was rocking linens
I guess that era's over man, hold on
I'm splitting atoms when the scientific spitting is getting at em'
I give em' different patterns, they didn't fathom, they stealing my styles
Before me you didn't have em'
You rappers made in my image like when God was inventing Adam
Stab em in the abdomen when its crunch time
I truly flip like Mayweather pissed of at a movie script
Too many punchlines
Family I'm amongst mine
I keep the peace like a monks mind
.357 fade your favorite barber
Leave you in an old bush like an unshaven Barbara
Don't stop what we doing
When you see L.A. your team will be ruined
This game need a new villain, I'm the kind to murder you on vine, ooh kill em'

[Introduction: Big Trigger]
Ladies and gentlemen
Now introducing the man, the myth, the legend
Mister Marshall Mathers AKA (chicka-chicka) Slim Shady

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Ayo can we cut this beat off
I might need to do this acapella, yo
Role model?
I'll roll a model down a hill over broke bottles of coke products
If she don't swallow, and tie her to the bumper, hit the throttle
While I'm tryna hit the pot holes, I'll freaking take Madonna to McDonalds
Any ho'll end up horizontal gettin' fondle
I don't cuddle, I don't coddle
Only motto that I follows is everything I drive, whether it's a  Navajo or a Tahoe
It's got a ho in it
Nah ho, I don't got no freaking bronco
You looking for a buck, get a horse, fuck Tonto
I got a rusty Hondo with some bondo
And a box of condoms you little blond ho
Fuck me? Fuck you too, like I'm at Bonnaroo booing Bono
And I ain't from this planet so nanu, nana, nanu
I'm intolerable, too volatile, screw it
I don't got too make the honor roll to be on a roll
I don't know much, what I do know I do it pronto though
So knock it off, all these knock-off-me's,
The last thing the world needs is another me
But if you think this is part 2 to Recovery
Or to "Love the Way You Lie" part twelve
Or something heart felt, you 'bout to make a discovery
Like you found Christopher Columbus' compass
Ain't dumbing shit down for you dumb motherfuckers, so suck it
I took your best punchline like a punch in the stomach
That punctured a lung punk and I'm still functioning from it
Chump it was nothing
Now watch while I fuckin' one up it and toot my own horn
Once I think of something to trump it
And I don't need a fucking instrument to sound off
Like the trunk of an elephant; the triumphant
Return of the ether spitting retard, reborn
But chances of you having another re-birth, slim to none
Like a skinny Mother Teresa, give a fuck if it's Easter, so kiss my keister
'Cause that's the only thing I'll turn the other cheek for



[Spoken: Eminem]
Ayo Paul, it's Em
I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing
And I know that he's not "thrilled" about the video
What, does he wanna be startin' somethin'?
Wow, well I'll show him who's really bad {*burps*}

Paul the way you make me feel with these calls
You should really take a look at the man in the mirror
And tell him to beat it because I won't stop till I get enough

Do you remember the time
We were watching the "Billie Jean" video?
Well, he'll always be that Michael to me
And it doesn't matter if he's black or white
Because I can't stop loving him
And I hate plastic surgeons and I hope they all fucking die

How do you like that? And I like him, I like him a lot
I wanna touch him, but I can't {*mouth noises*}
Excuse me, I'm taking a shit, sorry

Anyways, call me back
I have this idea about how I want to end the show
So, hit me when you get this message, fucker
Oh, and by the way, no, I don't have a new gun
{*Gun cracks and bullets fall out*} Goddamn it!



[Skit: Eminem & GPS]
Paul, yo, um
So I got your message, I wish you would answer the fuckin' phone
Um...
(Turn right)
No, I don't plan to reply to everybody who fuckin' says something fucked up about me
But I will say this, I was reading some comments last night about, like (Turn right), what people are fuckin' saying about Revival
And uhh
Yo, this Yahoo motherfucker, whatever the fuck his name is, said I rhyliterally said I rhymed "rhymes" with "chimes"
"Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes"
(Turn right)
Like, you don't understand I'm rhyming the entire fuckin' sentence you fuckin' moron
(In 100 feet, turn left)
It's my fault 'cause you're fuckin' stupid
But I swear to God this motherfucker lives in Michigan and I think I figured out his address
And I'm on my way to his fuckin' house right now
(Turn left)
I'll hit you back later



Artist: Tony Touch f/ Eminem

[Eminem]
If I'm elected for ten terms
I'm renewing the staff after the inagural
And hiring all girls as interns
If I don't like you, I'll snatch you outta your mic booth
While you're rappin and pull your right through the window and fight you
I'll take you straight to the pavement
Uppercut you, and scrape your face wit a bracelet
Like a razor that shaved it
Three drinks and I'm ready to flash
Runnin on stage in a G-string, wit a bee sting on my ass (Look!)
It's probably all cuz I ain't awkward at all
I just like to walk through the mall, stop, and talk to the wall
And have a relapse after I just fought through withdrawal
(Hop in the car little girl, I just bought you a doll)
The Bad and Evil movement is comin
Plus the music is pumpin like a pill freak wit a tube in his stomach
I write a rhyme a day
So it's no wonder how come your whole album
Is soundin like a bunch of shit that I would say
Whether it's one verse or one letter
I'll probably be the cleverest one that never gets spun ever
It's Slim Shady and Tony Touch, it's only us
The rest of y'all are just stuck in the middle wit Monie Love



Hey yo, what do you think about two grown ass men
Living together?
Alright. What do you think about another grown ass man
Living right upstairs from them?
Well those two grown ass men
Living together on my nuts
And that shits right above them

When I rhyme somehow I think I must subliminally
Throwing viagra at these fags who got these hard-ons for me
But I suppose anything goes when it comes to my flows
Nothing is off limits except for Michaels' nose!
I didnt know, I'm so sorry please tell me what I can do
To make it up to those of you who I offended. Ooh!
I got it, I got it, apology for Steve Harvey too, its in my pocket
(Oh wait, here it is)
FUCK YOU!! Hey!
What do you say Andre whats new? Life is good man Im chilling, 50 how 'bout you?
Yayo's out of jail, Buck is out on bail, well make it through, we always do
ODB, rest in peace, G-G-G-UNIT!



[Verse 1]
It's the mothafuckin' Farm Club
This little girl 'bout to get a arm rub
Who wanna see me on this mothafuckin' fiction board
Who wanna see me on a mothafuckin' diction lore
And I'll be kicking source to mothafuckin' camera looking right in it
I can kick twenty dope rhymes in one minute
And y'all don't understand cause my rhymes are Infinite

[Refrain]
What's the Farm Club?
It's the mothafuckin' *chika-chika* Farm Club
It's the mothafuckin' *chika-chika* Farm Club

[Verse 2]
Is this shit there wasn't be bleeped out?
I don't know but I feel it is and it's like *eeh-eh*
And I will kicking rhyme until it stops to *eeh-eh*

[Outro]
What? Wha-what? It's the Farm Club?
What? Wha-what? Wha-what? It's the Farm Club?



[Intro: Eminem, Mr. Porter & Tim Westwood]
Yo blast me off, Tim
Where's that boom?
Blast me off, son
Right now, we're doin' this for Beijing, baby, understand how it's goin' down
Blastin' off right now, son
Real big. Real legendary up in the game. Drippin' in swagger juice. We ready to go in this?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Are we swaggered up?
Swaggered up, yeah
Let's do it, baby. Radio 1, Westwood [?] about to go down. Eminem. Kon, baby. Alchemist. We're doin' it like this. Let's go, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
A'ight, a'ight, look

[Plays "Respect My Conglomerate" by Busta Rhymes]

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wasn't born mean, I was pushed to treachery
I walk the streets lookin' for some puss to fetch me
I'm like a veggie, brain is turned to mush, I'm edgy
Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie
If he don't gimme Kim, things could get messy
So pass that ass to me, let me squish the left cheek
And press against the right one 'til it's smushed against me
And leave a dead body in the woods, the MC
With the Christopher Reeve's beef
We started out on the wrong foot
Or should I say fake leg made outta wood
I shouldn't, yes I should
Ridin' through the hood, I'm chillin' with Westwood
I'm quite mellow, a white fellow
My pee is bright yellow, I like Jell-O
I'm like, "Hello" to a cute little dyke on the mic
I'm kinda like Iron Mike 'cause I bite earlobes

[Verse 2: Mr. Porter]
Well, I must must say, well, um
I'm just not gay, well, um, I must must say, um, well, look
See I'm the first one to class and the last to leave
I mean the first one to leave outta class, believe
That I'm a mailbox pimp in my heart 'til I die
Even after I'm all gone and my ashes fried
Went from an ashy guy, class clown as high
To a grown ass man stackin' motherfuckin' paper
Runyon Ave.'s the clique, D12's the game
We've been spittin' this shit since we was little bbs
Gaga goo goo nana, nani do do never
Word to my homie Em, I'm just too too clever
A 4-5 shot and leave a nigga's face lop-sided
The kick from the barrel make you think I'm cock-eyed
When I bust it out off in the crowd, niggas start divin'
Greg Louganis went over the bar, I ain't lyin'
Hot Iron lethals, not defyin' a soldier
Runyon Ave. soldier equals death when it's over
It's none colder than niggas to understand the struggle
Apply the street-muscle we've been hard to hustle
We've been hard to hustle, we've been hard to muscle
Apply the street hustle, we've been hard to hustle

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Aight, aight
Me and Westwood blastin' off, jackin' off
In a pair of acid washed bumpin' Asher Roth
Cruisin Gratiot 'til I damn near crash the car
Tryna smash 'em off in the dash, hit the overpass, went off
Over the bridge into oncoming traffic
Caused a massive forty-two car pile-up, not a scratch at all
Hopped up holdin' an axe and saw
Jason mask is off when my face is plastered in tabasco sauce
Spittin' flames, kickin' fire out your ass, you little bastard
You can pass it on, I'm battery acid, dawg
You don't wanna get my ass ticked off
I'm harder than playin' basketball when I'm goin' through crack withdrawal
Dick so big it's like elastic
I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic
Crossed the path of Plastic Man with a drastic force
And went spastic, put my penis on classic sports

[Verse 4: Mr. Porter]
Look, I shoot straight off the hip
Trey-eight off the grip
See, I ain't fo' that shit
I got a fist print fo' yo' lip
Lookin' shit is swole up
Like the stomach on a fat pregnant bitch
And it's evident
That I'm gettin' chips like the president
Then a lot of woos
Keep the tools for the haters left
Niggas ain't fadin' 'em
Seel a crack, do a trim
Got a lot of dough but you know I ain't trickin' on 'em
Get some head spinnin' on 'em
Keep the head spinnin' on 'em
See, I ain't diggin' on 'em
Keep the head hidden from 'em
You know how it go, no dough trickin' on 'em
She just wanna pop, see what she can get from her
But she don't know my name, I'm 'bout the game, I'm pickin' on her
Wrist so cold and my left hand's numb as summer
I rip a hole 'til she don't want you gettin' on her
She makes you wonder if the women even want ya
Mr. Porter, keep a hungry [?]
Learned it from my daddy, I teach it to my daughter
Ya oughta know the quota of my whole workout
I float like Noah and don't worry about the rover bounce, yeah

[Plays "Microphone" by Slaughterhouse]

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Once again it's the sinister, cynical, minister Shady
Kryptonite to Superman, he's a dentist to Amy
Administer of the pain, just finished, huffin' the paint
And muffled the fumes like it was nothing because it ain't
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
His venom he spray, reaches like beams of energy rays
Menacin' stares, he glares makin' the hairs
All on the back of your neck stand
Like Dracula yep
Spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan
Yah, Angela so I command you to start dancin'
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical shark
Throwin' animal parts at Scarlett Johansson
Enter my gas chamber, ya gangsta, my ass
He's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
You're facin' a task greater, he's chasin' your ass
He's got his face in a mask, your blood stains on his glass table

[Verse 6: Mr. Porter]
I'm so obnoxious, open hand slap nigga, you with me?
See, you couldn't, you went off cryin' like Cuba Gooding
I swan dive in your bitch pussy, I call her puddin'
She love us [?], I love the bitch cookin'
Scrap that, you niggas weak as Chuck Nevitt
I fuck bucket [?] Jesus swing reckless
Entrepo-po head honcho, hope you're ready 'fore I pop his ass
Nigga, kickin' through your door
You send goons to do your work
I send goons to mommas in church, I've been a problem since birth
Got a middle finger up her skirt
I don't ask a bitch on a date, I ask her can I fuck her first
See y'all with this Runyon shit
I made something out of nothing, I'm a hustler, bitch
I keep a nine tucked burnin' up beside of my hip
Gotta make a hit for any nigga for fifty thousand chips, bitch

[Verse 7: Eminem]
I'm checkin' the exposure, a full dose of me exposin'
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posin'
With or without clothing, next to the decomposin'
Bodies erodin' while I'm dozin' off overdosin'
Windows opening-shutting, doors opening-closing
I think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and codeine
I was only supposed to swallow a half, I took the whole thing
I'm not jokin', I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink, I'm standin' over the sink posing
Myself, self-loathing, 'cause I'm on a brink, mostly
I don't wanna think this will make everything rosey
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severin' three toesies
Totally frozen while I close in, I'm yodellin'
Rosey, won't you come out to play
Aint no sense, wastin' time, cuttin' and pastin' headlines
In the papers makin' shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put neurofens in my syrup and stirred 'em
You never heard him like this, so don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, and lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
Eighty spirits of ladies 'cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turn of events and then he emerged
Took over the world and reeled in all the children
Lured 'em into the building and killed 'em
Buried 'em in the mulch and mildew and he will
Do what he feels and still can spin
Straw into gold like Rumpelstiltskin
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol - three pills, the Real Slim
Shady's entered the building
There's nothing but crumbled leaves and
Tumbleweeds up in this bitch, Mildrid
He's ill with it, he still shouldn't be healed
There's no one as sick as he, MC's
Will get fricasseed on the grill then
(Woah, I like.... Fuck)
Right now, building's on fire, fuck you

[Plays "Chonkyfire" by OutKast]

[Verse 8: Eminem]
You wanna start with the hook first
You wanna start with the...oh
I have no idea what I'm doin', I have no idea what I'm doin', but
Everybody get up, sit up Christopher
They're miserable without you, Superman is a-
Live and he's flowin' like the Mystic River
Girl, don't act like you've never been kissed before
One, two, three, four, five, six, this uh
Rhyme is about to hit you right in the kisser
How did anybody ever find me? I disa-
-ppeared, I was hidin' in Freeway's beard, just a
Hop, skip and a jump from my skin gushin'
Nails into my face that I been pushin'
Hellraiser, my face is my pin cushion
It's like when I'm on the mic I can squish a
Sucker like a vise grip, my pen put ya
In the slaughterhouse 'cause your style's been butchered
I'll spin chainsaw, take off like the blades on, my brain's on
Hyperdrive, someone put the brakes on

[Chorus: Eminem & Mr. Porter]
Here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
Now here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it (Huh-uh), ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice (Yeah), my swag juice
I got you slippin' on my swag juice (Okay, look)

[Verse 9: Mr. Porter]
I got it figured out now, nigga, see
Mmy mind's right, money right, can't nobody stoppin' how I get it
In hindsight I never should've left where I was livin'
I probably wouldn't be gettin' pressed by all these women
But then again I wouldn't have met the ones that I was diggin'
So now I like to look and talk a lot like
She like Lil Kim and Kim and Serena Williams
Just like my [?] I'm a regular Charles Dickens
Bitch, called me talkin' 'bout she pregnant
She [?] so I Mannie Fresh'd that ho and left baby
I'll never trust her, no, shit
Even if she specialize in mouth massagin' my testicles
I never trusted her a whole lot, even on the first day we met
She's basically gettin' her mouth raped
Then turn around and ask me for a kiss, "No, bitch, I'm straight"
I never really been concerned with how my own dick taste

[Pre-Chorus: Mr. Porter & Eminem]
I think I'm 'bout to slip on my swag juice
I think I'm 'bout to slip on your swag juice
Oh no! No, no, don't slip on your swag juice!
Yeah, yeah, I think I'm 'bout to slip on my swag juice

[Chorus: Eminem & Mr. Porter]
So here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slippin' on my swag juice
Alright

[Verse 10: Eminem]
Slim is in the house, simmer down there sister
Bound to get you dizzy 'cause he gets as busy as a
Bee; baby, you could throw a frisbee in a blizzard
He'll catch it in his teeth, what is he? He's a wizard
Standin' in the disco with a disco biscuit
And I'm pretty sure it isn't Bisquick, is it?
Now baby don't forget to bring your lipstick wit' ya
I want the kiss 'fore I blow this bitch to smithe-
Reens, get the guillotines, this is a situ-
Ation that's critical as Dre spins his, uh
Turntables and he cuts the record like a scissor
Checka-chicky-checka-chicky-checka-checka-chicka
We'll wreck it in a second, tell me what the heck is sicker
Wait a minute, I just dropped my necklace in the liquor
Now baby just to make a little breakfast and it's six o'-
-clock in the morning 'less you want to get some dessert

[Chorus: Eminem & Mr. Porter]
Here's a smidgen, a midget to get your Bridgets, digit
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slippin' on my swag juice
I said, here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slippin' on my swag, my swag juice

[Outro: Eminem & Tim Westwood]
Yeah, ayo, just so everybody knows, that was a hook that we made on the way to the radio station and we were trying to get it right so we may have fucked it up a couple times or whatever, but this is what we were trying to, like, work out before we came here. Especially for Westwood, man! 'Specially for you, homie!
Damn, Eminem, [?] baby



[Verse 1: Mr. Porter]
Welcome to the ill world of Mr. P-O
Ayy, keep the talk, B, I'm tryna see dough
If it ain't about bread, what we gon' speak fo'?
If it ain't no lead, then it ain't no beef, bro
You better get a leash cause yo' freak ho
Specialize in wood like she Home Depot
I'm like Chico DeBarge, we stars
Roscoe P. Coltrane in these bars
Man, Amtrak, I'll break her damn back
Man, it's Ralph Lauren, this ain't no damn Chaps
It's all Polo, I'm so pro though
You bird-crazy; El Pollo Loco
Talkin' about cheese and this ain't no photo
Askin' about rings like the ho know Frodo
You better get out of my house and shit
I think I threw up in my mouth a bit: I'm sick

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Niggas be lyin', talkin' about they bust a heater
Once I see him, maybe more like Justin Bieber
Leavin' my rivals underground, like Skyzoo's, how I do
I have him layin' in the street and bleedin', butt-naked
With a bullet in his mothafuckin' head like Erykah Badu
I find irony in bein' in a place
Where I'm wearin' Gucci, mane, gettin' whiteboy wasted
I tell a nigga: break bread or take lead
I'm tryin' to get rid of this weight, like K-Fed
Me and Denaun got a gangsta bond
We like that once-in-a-lifetime thing to you
That ain't the prom
The next MC that rhyme official, with ref, with a whistle
That ain't Young Money, I'ma definitely diss you
If you rhymin' "packin' a MAC" with "back of the Acura"
Or perhaps you can't match my spectacular vernacular
You still rhymin' bottles with models, college with knowledge
Usin' the word swagger, you're probably garbage
You thugs funny, comparin' 5'9" to anybody
You comparin' Superman to Bugs Bunny

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm like a white Michael  Vick, psycho enough to stick
Michael J. Fox in a microwave with a Rott
I might make a little Aliz with a side of NyQuil
And ride a motorcycle bike
Right through the side of my high school
Satan's disciple with a sniper rifle
And a knife and a white diaper
Liable to shit on you while I snipe you
So dope he gets off opiates
What an appropriate way to start off his day!
He may just smart off to Dre
He may be hard to contain
Cause his rage is so hard to gauge
See, Hannibal ate his face, and met Jason, gnawed off his leg
Amazin' hard-on for razors and blades
And anything sharp, even poisonous darts
It all plays a major part of his game
Holy water won't ward him off, crucifixes won't do the trick
He's so sick, it's ridiculous
Sawed the crazy part off his brain, he's still insane
Why's there bloodstains on his carpet, mane?
There's some crazy shit goin' on in Shady's apartment again

[Verse 4: Mr. Porter]
Okay, it's back to the blocks, slingin' yay like the old days
Superman on the beat, I carry my whole state
You wooden legs to a house: you can't hold weight
Oh shit, it's O'Shea Jacksonokay
A little bit of this twisted out with Obama in it
Mr. Porter back with anthrax, like Osama sent him
Bitch, I'm all that, I drive the girls crazy
They gotta look at Rorschachs to get they thoughts back
I ain't a small fry, small ticker, small tack
I make 'em all cry with big dick and raw sack
The potblood of science to return a raw rap
I'm the best, mane; Eli Porter stance

[Verse 5: Royce da 5'9"]
Y'all bitches should call Nickle the Don Bishop
A poet, a mixture of Don Goines and John Grisham
Flow'll have you rewindin' it four or five times
That landmine rhyme written with porcupine line
Step up in here with the Slaughterhouse
C.O.B. Gang will approach you
And bend your gun barrel to a horseshoe
Only fuck with monsters, we the truth
Monsters will pop up on you
Like you said "Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice."
I can't even see the booth, I could fit in Stevie's shoe
I'm sick, I got the Desert Eagle flu
I'm rich, lil' nigga, we don't need a cent, we Teflon
The doctor tried to take blood, the needle bent; ask Mom
Outta my mind if you can imagine
Usin' Magic's johnson without a condom, I'm bonkers
Got the streets goin', dude, it's tremendous
If I come for your blood, I ain't gon' be usin' syringes

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Newsflash, I'm still trash
Them pills shoulda killed my ass
But they didn't; they just made me stronger
It's like they rebuilt my ass
Like the Six Million Dollar Man after the crash
It's Aftermath, bitch! And my milk glass is still half-empty
Yeah, tempt me, Hell isn't enough
They need to invent somewhere new to send me
As sick as I'm getting
They'll stick me in a conventional oven
With a rotisserie setting and won't even notice me sweating
Shit, I done made a verse, said some foul shit
Tryna go back fix it, fucked around, and just made it worse
Yeah, I'm back, looking no worse for wear
Got these haters mad enough to rip off their hair
And start punchin' the air
Panties so in a bunch that they can't function
It's Shady and Royce, fuck yeah! What a dysfunctional pair!
So stop actin' like a punk, get a pair!
Take a pill and fall the fuck out, spill your lunch in the chair!

[Verse 7: Mr. Porter]
Look, I'm sick, somebody better get the Dimetapp
Who I gotta shoot just to prove that I can rap?
People ask where my shine is at
I say check the liner notes, I done done all kinda crap
I am so much of a star, bitch
That I can fart and piss on the red carpet
Look, my bank account's retarded
My debit card's got a helmet and a harness
Hey, meet demands, but they all are harmless
At shows my riders always the largest
I need four pounds of fried poultry carcass
And red M&Ms chartered from Charlotte
Look, and if you try to act dumb and start shit
I just yell at 'em, like, "I'm the artist!"
Infected  you know the deal
If you wanna play sick, we can all get ill
Look, measles, mumps
I made you bitches, I don't need you chumps
Y'all got cheese and I need my chunks
Hurry up, so I can go to burn rubber
And get some more dunks

[Verse 8: Royce da 5'9"]
Now, if your attitude determines your latitude
This house that we call hip-hop, I'm in the attic, fool
A mic and two turntables, fit for the unstable
Converted to a padded room
Keep a street sweeper; in fact, I call the mag a broom
You seein' beef, seein' things
You musta had yourself a bag of shrooms
I make a call, make 'em fake a fall
My clique is too sick, say goodbye
In the streets where the stakes is high, like Ruth's Chris
I'm from the city of true shit
Where the mayor went to jail
For bein' a player right after Proof split
Levels the head of competitors, Royce that
I'm drinkin' everyday
'Til Hex Murda get his regular voice back
Ras, I got ya, look scared at ya, blast from ya
From a block away; ask Tricky, I'm that niggie
I'm more hooder than black Dickies
I rap like committin' suicide
In the booth, takin' the track with me
Patrn's in my chromosomes
In order to leave it alone, you have to ween me off
That Lorena Bobbitt chopper will knock a weenie off
Put your body between chalk
I'm squeezin' the 9 iron, like I'm swingin' golf
I'm with the best rapper alive, put somethin' on it
Your sound's plain as a cheeseburger with nothin' on it

[Verse 9: Eminem]
I'll do a hundred-yard dash just to slash Kim Kardash'
In the ass with a shard of glass from Nick Hogan's car crash
You may look like the passenger for that, don't be a smartass
Yeah, laugh while you sit there
Thinkin' that the hard part passed
You ain't seen pain 'til Leatherface flips mane
I'll cut your fuckin' balls off, homie, my saw's off the chain
I chopped the bitch in half with it, sawed off her legs
And the top half of the torso fuckin' crawled off insane
I ain't seen shit like that since I went to Mike Jack's
Took the Elephant Man's skull, fucked it, and put it right back
Handed my dick to Bubbles
While he sucked it and licked my nut sack
Gave him a reach-around
While I fucked him right in his butt crack
Nah, I ain't takin' it back, faggot, fuck that!
I give a fuck about nothin', so here's where you fucked up at
Don't go touchin' that can
Man, you don't wanna open up that
Wait a min, ah, shit Alchemist, cut that!

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah)
To take a stand, it's been a ride
Everybody, I guess I had to
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Eminem:]
Paul, you're obviously not going to help me with this. I can see that. So...
Nah it's cool, don't worry about it

[Paul:]
I'm Sorry, I'm just trying to organize it

[Eminem:]
Okay, well I'm just trying to do some fucking drops that got fucked up that... Sorry

[Paul:]
Really?

[Eminem:]
Yeah

[Paul:]
Alright, well, maybe... maybe... uh... you wanna start over? What do you wanna do?

[Eminem:]
I don't know. Are. You probably haven't been listening. I think that this one is okay

[Vocal Scratching]
[Public Enemy #1 starts playing in the background]

[Eminem:]
Good Morning! Welcome to the Shady Classics Mixtape with DJ Whoo Kid



These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing, it's so scary in a house that allows
No swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he dont care
He's a problem child
And what bothers him all comes out, when he talks about
His fuckin' dad walkin out
'Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His step-father hit him, so he socked him back, and broke his nose
His house is a broken home, there's no control, he just lets his emotions
Go
Sing with me, (sing) sing for the years
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears, (come on)
Sing it with me, just for today, maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you
Away
Entertainment is changin, interwinin' with gangstas
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate, I guess words are a
Motherfucker they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have, they want you to lose your mind
Every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off
Of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously, so I'm signin' CD's while
Police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete
It's all political, if my music is literal, and I'm a criminal how the fuck
Can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to, you're full of shit, too, Guerrera
That was a fist that hit you
Sing with me, (sing) sing for the years
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears, (come on)
Sing it with me, just for today, maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you
Away
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you, and cock it, too
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus
But music is reflection of self, we just explain it, and then we get our
Checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it
How we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fuckin'
Thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
'Til they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe
We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and hold it
'Cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our
Songs and we can
Sing with me, (sing) sing for the years
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears, (come on)
Sing it with me, just for today, maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you
Away
Sing with me, (sing) sing for the years
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears, (come on)
Sing it with me, just for today, maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you
Away

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Obie the person that came up introverted
'Cause of nervousness, that was solely the only verdict
It was worth it 'cause he changed, became so observant
Servin' such of a purpose
If you knew him earlier in his days, it's like a different version
So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
That's why it's curtains in this murder, if you get him worked up
I'm so assertive on these muthafuckas acting tougher
Had enough of isolatin' myself in a room
Writing poems and songs, doing the same in school
Now look what he became, a fool
'Cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
Livin' hard but still Julliard
A god walks and ain't spend a day in the pew
Regardless of this I draw visual, pictures when a nigga vents
So welcome to the art department

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I stimulate the brain, mimic, emulate the sane
Cynics keep on thinkin' it's a fuckin' gimmick when it ain't
Clinically insane, brain is on Venus, up Uranus
Label me a genius if you ever seen us you would say
"He may seem as though he's plain normal" if you ever meet him
Greet him with a shake, see he ain't as mean as what they say
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say
So he's vague, so they mistake him for bein' crazed
You part ways, your impression of him changed
You don't think he's strange, you turn around and tell him; "Peace and thanks"
You catch him flippin' you off, with his pants down
Hands around his scrotum, tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs

[Verse 3: (Verse 1 Repeated): Obie Trice]
Obie the person that came up introverted
'Cause of nervousness, that was solely the only verdict
It was worth it 'cause he changed, became so observant
Servin' such of a purpose
If you knew him earlier in his days, it's like a different version
So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
That's why it's curtains in this murder, if you get him worked up
I'm so assertive on these muthafuckas acting tougher
Had enough of isolating myself in a room
Writing poems and songs, doing the same in school
Now look what he became, a fool
'Cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
Livin' hard but still Julliard
A god walks and ain't spend a day in the pew
Regardless of this I draw visual, pictures when a nigga vents
So welcome to the art department

[Verse 4: Eminem]
It's all psychologic, why am I so maniacal?
Am I a psycho or some kind of psychotic shtick?
Or am I truly psychotic? Or my molecules just diabolical?
'Cause biologically, I defy logic, by golly, haul me off on a trolley
Probably want a quack, or I'm back on that whacky tobacca
I'ma step away from crack, Obie smacked the shit out of me
I'm so slap happy, man, snap me back to reality
I'm a walkin' art gallery, a science museum
Elephantitis of the nuts, you'd probably die if you see them
I pull them out, they hit the ground and probably crack the cement
I need an ambulance, I can't just put them back in my pants (Help me!)

[Intro: 50 Cent & Eminem]
Sh-sh-sh, Shady! Aftermath! Haha!
G-G-G-G, G-Unit! Haha!

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Cause we came here to set this party off right
Lets bounce tonight
And if they dont let us in through the front
Well come through the side
Cause I dont ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Introduction: Eminem]
Get your ass up for the doctor, one more time
Get your ass up for the doctor, come on now
Here we go, cliff hanger, its another club banger
Got ya hangin on the edge of your seat, get on down

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Times up, games over, you lose, Iwin
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Oh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look whos got you goin crazy again
Im a trend, I set one every time Im in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you something that we already had
But once youre gone, you dont come back
Too bad, youre off the map now, radar cant even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin and moanin, wining and bitchin
Sit and observe, listen, youll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
Worldwide, were on the charts with a bullet and still climbin

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Cause we came here to set this party off right
Lets bounce tonight
And if they dont let us in through the front
Well come through the side
Cause I dont ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Introduction: Eminem, Dr. Dre & 50Cent]
When Dr. Dre says crunk, you will get it crunk
Get it crunk! Crunk! Crunk! Crunk!
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I dont gotta promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin off the hinges
We aint showin off, we just going off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?!)
We gon have this motherfucker hoppin in a second (Bump, bump!)
Thats why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasnt for rap to bridge the gap may be raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
To pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game
Thats why we came to

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Cause we came here to set this party off right
Lets bounce tonight
And if they dont let us in through the front
Well come through the side
Cause I dont ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Introduction: Eminem]
50 Cent, come on!

[Verse 3: 50 Cent, Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
Its no secret, everybody know
When Dres involved, theres plenty of money involved
And plenty honeys involved and sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, everyday is just another party
From the valleys all the way to them 8Mile alleys
Lets rally, hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dres about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, bangin out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazing out your speakers
So never say never cause Shady, Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the
The Doc and Shady, no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence thata

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
We came here to set this party off right
Lets bounce tonight
And if they dont let us in through the front
Well come through the side
Cause I dont ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Outro: Eminem & 50Cent]
Yeah, haha! Still Aftermath, 2006! And dont worry about that Detox album, its comin We gon make Dre do it! Haha! 50 Cent, G-Unit, Obie Trice, D-Twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr.Dre! We aint leaving, lets go, haha! Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming out! Peace!
*People chanting Eminems name*
*Footsteps*
Oh shit! I almost forgot

Youre coming with me!
*Eminem cocks the gun and starts shooting at the audience*
*People start to scream terrified and run*
*Gunshots and shouting*
Ha ha ha. Bye, bye!
*Eminem shoots himself*
See you in hell, fuckers



Brent Musberger: We welcome you back to Ann Arbor, Michigan and what a pleasure for Herbie and me to introduce Marshall Mathers. Some of you may know him as Eminem, but he's gonna join the Saturday night crew with our music intro starting next Saturday Night.

But folks, I wanna take you to the World Premiere of one of his new videos, called Berzerk. Take a listen, it's headed to the top of the charts.

[Berzerk video plays]

BM: Was that Rick Rubin who was helping produce that, with you Marshall, when you did that?

Eminem: Yeah, sorry. Live TV. Live TV freaks me out a little bit.

Kirk Herbstreit (KH): No!?

Eminem: Umm...yes. I'm sorry, what was the question?

BM: That was Mr. Rubin, one of the all-time greats...producer, huh?

Eminem: Yes, yes.

BM: How long does that take you to shoot a video like that? How many takes? How many hours?

Eminem: Umm...sometimes it's uh...it's usually a two day process, sometimes it could go to three. There's a lot of takes, there's a lot of sticking around waiting...But...it's cool [Herbstreit tries to interject] if the video comes out, then i guess it's worth it. You know.

KH: You wanna take it to break?

BM: Yeah...we'll take....you know...you gotta be in shape too, but stay right here with us, we're gonna kick off the 2nd half and I wanna talk about how you're gonna intro Saturday Night Football when we come back.

[commercial break]

BM: 8 EST on ABC, Marshall Mathers will open Saturday Night Football. Mathers, it's a pleasure to have you on the show.

Eminem: Absolutely, pleasure to be here. It's an honor to be able to do that. So..

KH: So you have the single out...album's coming out in November. What are you most excited about with this no album?

Eminem: Nothing.

KH: No?

Eminem: No...uhh...it'll be out Nov 5th. I'll probably be most excited to just be done with it. It's called the Marshall Mathers LP2. And..it's kind of a re-visit to the first Marshall Mathers LP...and umm...that's pretty much all i can say about it.

BM: One final question before you leave. Some of my friends in Montana wanted me to ask you. Will the Lions cover 4.5 tomorrow against Minnesota?

Eminem: Will the Lions cover 4.5?

BM: Yeah.

Eminem: Ummm...I'm not sure man...I don't ever make a prediction on the Lions cause I don't ever wanna jinx it, but I'm such a die hard Lions fan, like...to the core. So...yes, they'll win.

KH: That's all you'll say, leave it at that.

Eminem: Yeah...I'm hoping I didn't just jinx it.

BM: Here's the kickoff Marshall...just stick right here with us now. It's gonna be Wolverines ball. They've got the lead...out to the 25 yard line.

Marshall, again, it was a pleasure having you with us here tonight.

Eminem: And Brent, just how they got fantasy football or whatever. I got you on my fantasy announcer team. It would be you, of course the late great Pat Summerall and John Madden and Al Michaels. If you guys would get together and just call the game....Kirk, you're great too, much respect.

[All laugh]

KH: Not quite to that status yet, I get it!

Eminem: Right. But, you being a legend and you know, if you got with Al Michaels man and John Madden and just called ONE Lions game. The Super Bowl probably would be great this year.

KH: We'd all appreciate that wouldn't we?

Eminem: Man, that would be like a dream come true for me. You are a legend my friend. Thank you.

BM: YOU're the legend my friend! 13 Grammys, 1st rap song to win an Academy Award, an original score...Youve sold 100 million records world wide. YOU my friend are the legend.

KH: No doubt about that!

Eminem: I'm really uncomfortable right now.

[All laugh]

BM: Marshall, take care my friend. We look forward to seeing that video next week.

Eminem: Absolutely, Thank you, thank you...



[verse 1: Eminem]
Lights, action, cameras flashing
Managers, sponsors, concerts, monster mashing
Flashing type who might throw his underwear in the trash like Marilyn Manson
Updated Axle Rose
White version of shaft pimp slappin' hoes
Pull up like a Mac, jet black limo
Strecth so far back you can't see the back windows
Stepping out pink hats, furs and minks
Chicks on each arm, what the fuck you think?
Right arm go that kid from N'Sync's chick on it
Left arm got that little pink chick on it
Me and Dre at the VMA's again
Pissin' off all these lesbians and gays again

[Verse 2: Proof]
Let me show you what the clip does
Cause D12 are harder than virgins inside strip clubs
Yo, we bust thugs
You beatin us is like 20 inch doves on glove buzz
It won't happen don't take the satisfaction
With funk flex you got your back spittin'
Actin' like you harder than life
Peace to Obie Trice
Rock a mic is on the right
Obie Trice has been around the globe twice
How it feel with the shine show was
Peace to Mark Labelle, Flex and Paul Rosenburg
Yo Em Diddy save me
Ayo, I think my dad's going crazy



[Intro]
Lord, please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 1]
Momma had a baby and its head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off
But Momma don't want me, the next thing I know, I'm gettin' dropped off
Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off
Ring-ring-ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors, on their front porch
Their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch
But they didn't want me neither, so they left me on someone else's lawn
Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn
'Til somebody finally took me in, my great aunt and uncle, Edna and Charles
Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, they were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary, they'd gang up on me and sing this song
Sing this song, sing this song, sing this song, sing this song
It went a little something like
"Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn"
Momma why do they keep sayin' this? I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad?

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 2]
Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly-white, predominantly black. well, what about me?
Where does that leave me? Well, I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again, I'ma scream
While I'm projectile vomitin'; what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kiddin'? What do I look like, some kinda idi...
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that; why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit? It's such bullshit, it's tush mull bish
"Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin' about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
And the dad that he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife, how they go at it
Man, I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I can't imagine it. That little rich, poor, white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank and take a bath in it
Man, if I only had half of it"
Shit, if you only knew the half of it...
Haha

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 3]
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned, Mom, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn
Never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why are you not comin' this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale. I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere
I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, do-si-do now, curtains up, the show must go now
Ring-around-the-rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame was supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off-and-on? This ain't what I chose to be
So please, God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
I said, Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
(Evil deeds, evil deeds, evil deeds)

[Outro]
[Gunshot]
[Crowd cheering]
Oh!
Last one, baby, let's go
Last one, baby, let's go
Detroit!



[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, tryin' to figure out the difference
But I think the lines are starting to get blurred

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grimmin' every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
Cause I'm mentally rearrangin' his face
I need a change of pace
Cause the pace I'm workin' at's dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger, and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey
And started slowly roastin' 'em
Cause that's where most of my anger is based
Fuck your feelings! I feel like I play for the Saints
I just wanna hurt youaim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanye's
Jay's, Wayne's and the Drake's
I'm frustrated cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm goin' all out in this rap shit
And whatever the fallout is, I'm strapped
For battle, sucka-duck, crawl out the back!
It's a bar fight, prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools
Flyin' through the air and bottles breakin', mirrors also
And I ain't stoppin' 'til the swear jar's full
"You done called every woman a slut
But you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall (Palin)"
Oh, my bad, slut! And next time I show up to court
I'll be naked and just wear a law suit
Judge be like, "That's sharp
How much that motherfucker cost you?
Smart-ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker!
You're so fuckin' gravy, Marshall, I should start callin' you 'au jus'
Cause all's you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo."
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
I coulda changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic, K-Mart chains panic
Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker
Rekcufrehtom! (Rape your mother!) Tihs! (Kill your parents!)
And these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screamin', "Fuck! Shit! Fuck!", adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out, I was like, "Merits?
Fuck that! I'd rather be loud, and I like swearin'."
From the first album even the gals were like, "Tight lyrics!
Dreamy eyes!", but my fuckin' mouth was nightmarish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and
Opposition felt the opposite, sometimes I listen
And revisit them old albums often as I can and
Skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition
Ha-ha! Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first, then ignore the replies

[Hook: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
There's darkness closing in (Evil twin), there it goes again (My evil twin)
It controls my pen (My evil twin), but that ain't me, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)
But he's just a friend (Evil twin), who pops up now and again (Evil twin)
So don't blame me (Evil twin), just blame him, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)

[Interlude]
Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time

[Verse 2: Eminem]
So, who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber?
Nah, F with Christina!
I ain't fuckin' with either, Jessica neither:
Simpson or Alba, my album's just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve, or
Extra Strength Tylenol 3's
Feel like I'm burnin' to death, but I'm freezin'
Bedridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again, like the legend of Heath-uh-
Ledger, my suicide notes, barely legible, read the
Bottom, it's signed by the Joker
Lorena said I never can leave her
She'll sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit, bitch! Give up my dick for pussy?
I'll be Jerry Mathers I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off, tryin' to mess with a cleaver
Golly-wally, I vent, heat register, Jesus
Ever since 19946 Dresden, it was definitely my
Destiny when on the steps, I met DeShaun
At Osborn, I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes
While I wrote rhymes, tryin' to get props for 'em
Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleepin', I made 'em stop snorin'
Made them break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip-hop in its tip-top form
Since N.W.A was blarin' through my car windows
Leanin' on the horn, screamin' "Fuck the police!" like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
Fuck top five, bitch, I'm top four
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin
So who the fuck you think that third and that fourth spot's for?
And crazy as I am, I'm much tamer than him
And I'm nuts, then again, who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that (evil grin)
(Evil twin) please come in, what was your name again?
Hi! Faggot! Look who's back
With a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear, and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney, jeez, it just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
Cause I'm so sick of bein' the truth
I wish someone'd finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh, LMFAO, no way, Jo-
-se Baez couldn't beat this rapO.J., no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony, hey ho
(Hey-ho!) I sound like I'm tryin' to sing
The fuckin' chorus to "Hip Hop Hooray"? No
Im hollerin', you got bottom-end like an 8-0-
8 and I 'base' whether we're fuckin' off that instead of your face so
Let your low-end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho? Slow dancin' or bowling?
You tryin' to hold hands with your homie?
What, you think I'm lookin' for romance cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman, try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke, so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside, I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
Cause we are the same, bitch!

Condom on my dick? Of course it is
This bitch don't know what abortion is
So I can't cum in her, fucks like a porn star
Looks like Jenna, fuck I'm gonna
Cum, I think my rubber's comin' off
But oh, it's so fucking wet and soft
Fuck, I'm gonna start lettin' off

And she's on top, I'm gonna facking
Oh, god, oh, don't do that
Don't, stop, stop, don't, I don't mean "don't stop"
Ow, wait a minute, ow, ow, fuck

[Verse 3]
Okay, I'm done, I already came twice
You ain't gonna make me cum

Uh, your finger just went in my ass
Ow, that hurts, take it out now
Oh, wait a minute, aw
Put it back in, in-in-in
This don't mean I'm gay, I don't like men
I like boobs, boobs, boobs
Now see that gerbil, grab that tube
Shove it up my butt
Let that little rascal nibble on my asshole, uhh
Yeah, right there, right there
Ahh, I'm cumming, oh, yeah
Fack, I just came again
Okay, pull it out now, enhh
Oh, fuck yeah
Wait, he's not out, he's still crawling around up there
Ow, fuck, I think it's stuck
Ow, but it feels so fucking good

[Chorus]
Owwww, owwww, owwww (Oh, god damn!)
I'm gonna facking cum! (Oh, shit!)
Fack, fack, fack (Fuck, I am!)
I am, I'm going to cum (I'm cumming!)

[Outro]
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Ew, ew, ew, ew



[Intro: Eminem & Justin Vernon]
You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Threes not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tapeguess I got a chronic case (Yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (Nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made "Not Afraid"
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' JAY
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it Walk-on-Water-Gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted Shady? You got him!

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (Look)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lackin' with it, "He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit"
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, "Hold your head up!"Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (Pew)Gabby Giffords
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a [censored], bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show (Ha), sorry if I took forever (Ha-ha)

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Ha)
Don't fall on my fate (It's too easy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (Ha-ha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word to
Everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (Yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' an Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (Woo!)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9"s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall bitch! (Yeah)

[Outro: Justin Vernon]
It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Threes not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire



[Hook: Lazie Boi]
Cause Baby I'm Lonely
Can Somebody Hold Me
It Feel Like I'm Fallin Now, I Can't Hold My Ground
It Feels Like I'm Only
Trying But Slowly
It Feels Like I'm Fallin Now, I Can't Hold My Ground
No More

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Probably one of my realest loves ever, four page letters
In time its all better, cause time heal whatever
I'mma need a moment cause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather, females are on regular
Whats the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
Id rather stay friends with benefits 'til we ready
Now ready, Sean Don got me feeling heavy
She like one more chance, more problems, no Biggie, ah
Its all good, dont take it the wrong way
Aint nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or you can take your space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that
Tell your friend they can fall back
Aint even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like?
I'm like...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
My enemies crack corn but I don't care

You can be black white or albino yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head

A little bit psycho but I know that
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it
See if you don't brag then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
You can just keept making them tired old threats
Little bit like the boy who cried wolf did
See me but don't dare to try no shit
Cuz you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quite and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts right out the sky go blast

[Hook]

[Outro: Lazie Boi]
Cause Baby I'm Lonely
Can Somebody Hold Me
It Feel Like I'm Fallin Now, I Can't Hold My Ground
It Feels Like I'm Only

[Eminem hook]
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass-confusion
And drastic movement of people acting stupid

[Eminem Verse 1]
You 'bout to witness hip-hop in it's most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless, most
Hardest, most honest known artist, chip off the old block, but ol' Doc is, {back}, looks like
Batman brought his own Robin, oh God, Sadam's got his own Laden, with his own private plane, his
Own pilot, set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges, oranges, peach, pears, plums
Syringes, {vnn vnn}, yeah here I come, i'm inches, away from you, dear fear none, hip-hop is in
A state of 911, so

[eminem hook]
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with

You just know that's the new shit

[obie trice verse 2]
Niggas, I'm still grinding, (yeah...)
I'm still hearing those sirens
I'm still getting chased by those lights
Only the light's mine and my mic's on
And my time is none because I'm writing more
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this buisness
I'm here to eat, speak, until these hoes feel this, (for sure...)
And I can't let y'all derail me man
I got young Kobe, homie, you gotta let go of Obie
Cause Obie be back, (ain't goin' nowhere man...)
We got them craps going on
And that yak going on
Soon as a nigga touch down back from tourin'
It's whateva, put that on the chedda man
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Ivene time
Chase cheese, rhyme till my voice give out
This is it my nigga, this what we boast about
Now I'm here so shut your motherfuckin mouth

This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit

[eminem verse 3]
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that it's sorta unique
Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like tryin to smoke crack
And go to sleep, I'm strapped
Just knowing any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
For you to play me, it's cockamamie
You just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cockadoodle, my clocks cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeahhh, the whole kitten-kaboodle
I'm just brutal. It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass

[eminem hook]
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit

*People chanting Eminem*

*Eminem tears up a paper*

*Footsteps*

*Door open and slam shut*

*More footsteps*

[Spoken: Slim Shady]
I almost forgot
You're comin' with me

*Gun cocking*

[Spoken: Eminem]
Last one baby, let's go
Last one baby, let's go
Last one baby, let's go

*Eminem sighs*



[Verse 1]
Another day, another hotel, the inside of it is nice though, oh well
This is my life so as I go and try on clothes for tonight's show
To see how far that line goes, still blows my mind, show business
Guess I'll just never get, so this shit just always feels so weird
To this day because all's I ever did
Was just say the shit I would've wanted to hear
Other people say to me when I was a kid
So please don't make me some type of hero
'Cause I will say some ol' inspirational shit in a real way
But still will have a field day with some of the fucked up shit
In the world and tell it to suck on the dick, 'cause I still make fun
Of a sitch someone's in like a son of a bitch at another's expense
I'm fuckin' relentless as fuck when it comes to this pen
I struggle with coming to senses, stuck on the fence
It's a balance beam, if I seem unbalanced, it's challenging
When my conscience allows me to think the most foulest
Childish things without even blinking, without even thinkin' about
All the stinkin' amounts of people that seems to be reachin'
But the crowds, they're screaming
And The Palace sold out this evening
But now it's lay me down to sleep
And is it really my soul to keep, or have I sold it cheap?
Is it greed? And do I take more than I need?
When I joke of leavin', but keep overachievin'
'Cause what it's stole from me I've barely broken even

[Hook: Luis Resto]
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

[Verse 2]
So a martyr is how I paint myself
And through my harrowin' ordeals Im so vain I want my respect
But ignore the butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
'Til I sit in the dark and I reflect
And my reflection shows what it's like here
'Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights
Yeah, it's like a nightmare
I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a night mirror
And I don't like how I see myself, so I open the Bible to Isaiah
'Cause I swear to Christ there are nights when I stay up and might
Say a prayer twice just to make sure God hears
'Cause this ice layer I skate on's a nice way of putting it
But I like stayin' feistier than a triceratops and like a dice player
I got a nice paradise here, sealed off in my lair
Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit from
And this house, is quite bare, but it ain't when you can't leave it
And I feel so isolated, it's nice I made it
But it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it
So I bitch about my life then make another song
Vicious cycle ain't it, then wonder why I stay famous
I keep walkin' the line, this goldfish bowl gets old
But especially when you dont know
If your conscience is sayin' I told you so
'Cause you don't even know anymore
If you got the soul of a soldier, or you sold your soul

[Hook: Luis Resto]
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

[Bridge]
And from here you look so small
Hovering high above us all
Please come back to me

[Verse 3]
I still remember the times when
They were simpler than the rhymes of
Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics
I'll never forget what that feeling was like
I miss those times now when I was just starting out
Without a dime and now I'm diamond
I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been
Stuck in this house hibernatin', hate even going outside
It sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk into Target and look at shit and browse, I don't even want to buy nothin'
I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it
Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and
Everything about it I miss, which now reminds me
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz
Wow, I must have had Alzheimer's
Long time since I shouted them out, 'bout time
'Cause it's been on my mind lately how
Zee, you always supported me
You vouched, I will never forget that and
How you guys accepted me for me and Pace
I love you too, you slept on my couch
And I've been thinkin' 'bout the time
When I slept on the floor at The Outhouse
Rhyming's all we ever wanted to do
And regardless how life has turned out
Inside I'll, I'll always be an outsider
My life has been turned inside out but I

[Hook: Luis Resto]
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

[Outro]
But I keep walkin' the line...



[Paul Rosenberg]
First Word, Excrement

[Eminem]
Exclimate, is that what you said?
My next defense, against these extra men
Who try to step to me and wanna have sex again

[Vaseline]

[Eminem]
You little sickass, I'll spray em with gasoline
They try to jack me off with Vaseline
My ass is mean, I smash your spleen
When I crash the scene

[Cell Phone]

[Eminem]
With a cell phone, now who the hell is home?
Y'all can't tell Paul how to throw me words

[Animal Crackers]

[Eminem]
Cause animal crackers is what I do when I eat MC's like a cannibal backwards
Ha ha, I got it, that's not it
Fake rappers been spotted

[Broken Headphones]

[Eminem]
Like broken headphones, you head home, you sped home
You get your head blown, rappers try to step, they speak in the dead tones
So I ain't trying to hear them, give me another, word for your mother

[Stretch Armstrong]

[Eminem]
Stretch Armstrong, my brother, coming with rhymes every time that I be drumming
Running with this shit when I kick a bitch in the stomach
And star wars, this car's a Taurus
Yo, how many bars we hit tonight, cause I'm drunk off

[Peanut Butter]

[Eminem]
Off peanut butter, you see my dick and you start to stutter
Start to utter, words that you shouldn't utter

[Mark Whalberg]

[Eminem]
Cause Mark Whalberg is a small turd, and I'mma step on him like dogshit
A fore fist, so rappers just get off it, I come across with

[Pulp Fiction]

[Eminem]
With pulp fiction, yo I'll eat you like a big gulp addiction
Like slurpees, got herpes, got a hair piece, rest my anises(?)
Got brain damage, I'm dumber than rain man is
There's mayonnaise on this, I need a plain sandwich
Hurry up, give me one, rappers try to step to this static they wanna give me none

[Fresh vegetables]

[Eminem]
With fresh vegetables, my testicles are hanging off to the left of you
You're bisexual, and there's a guy next to you, standing, rappers know that I
Be-

[Preparation H]

[Eminem]
Preparation H, you didn't even let me finish my rhyme
Just shut up for one more time, while I just shine, on this
Microphone, cause I'mma be honest, any MC who tries to step to this
I'm making you a promise, that what? Give me a word

[Nostradamus]

[Eminem]
That Nostradamus is blowing up your house, killing your foster mammas
And coming back to get your parents, well I have it
These rhymes are fourteen karat, solid gold
Rappers step to me, you get your wallet stole

[Times Square]

[Eminem]
In Times Square, I got blonde hair, I'm higher than con air
Rappers don't want to see me, I'll butt fuck Goldie Hawn bare
In a lawn chair, cause I'm there

[Kurt Russell]

[Eminem]
With Kurt Russell, saying "come here Goldie, you want my love muscle?"
I know you want it, I get blunted, then I
Kick these, freestyles just like whipped knees

[Taxicab]

[Eminem]
With a taxicab, I'll smack a bitch with a maxi pad
Where we going? Don't ask me dad
Leave me alone, I'm not trying, to even hear you
Dad, I hope you're fucking dying, off this porno mag
Yo, did you see my ad? Yo, wait a minute, did you see my ass?
Is what I meant to say, I meant to say a rhyme that goes this way is elementary
For the century, Slim Shady's is gonna be the illest

[Flamingos]

[Eminem]
What? Flamingos? My mother goes out and plays bingo
Every single day, at the bingo hall, that's why my dick is single, small
Didn't blow up, just don't give a what? A cuff?
Didn't blow up, just don't give a what? A cuff?

[DT's fired]

[Eminem]
But DT's fired, he's retired, he's not hired, yo plus I'm tired
Of busting and spitting this rhyme nonstop, I'm on top
Taking records to the pawnshop, stretch
Damn, see my big ick? Catch
Put a D in front of it, rappers don't want none of it
Coming with a ton of shit to spill, Slim Shady out, I get ill with the skill
Baby, aight baby, Slim Shady
Kick eighty million rhymes, till I'm older than Grady
Spilled gravy, all over my damn navy blue avi
Bye bye



[Chorus: Just Blaze]
Some people ask me, where I've been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody can save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted or try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, they say I'm crazy
They ask what me I think and I say maybe I'll fly away
And ain't nothing in the way so I may as well fly away
There ain't nothing else to say so I may as well fly away
I know you wanna see me down but we ain't gon' die today
'Cause I done been to the top and there's nowhere else to go
And the only way to see me's if you looking up from down below
And there's nothing else to say so I may as well fly away
And there's nothing in my way so I may as well fly away
I'm on top of this thing so I may as well fly away

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Got my self esteem back, got my confidence up
I'ma step up on this stage now, I'm gonna strut
And walk around with my pants hanging offa my butt
And you ain't 'bout to tell me nothing boy, get off of my nuts
It goes one for the money, two for the show
My shit don't stink, I don't think so
Wipe my ass with the tissue and roll it back up in the roll
Are you ready now, here we go, the bald eagle has landed
I'm back in your hair, sorry for leaving you stranded
I'm twice as dreaded, evil and rancid
They can't sit, I don't think anybody understands it
Especially when the world's silly putty in your hands
It's Play-Doh, I ain't back to play, though
They say he died in a fatal car crash, shows what they know
Shit if I did, it'd be a trailer not a car
The white trash star, I fuck an RV-up like Brett Favre
Homie you got it backwards, you're dipping your soup
Inside your crackers, I can carry rap till my back hurts
Set it down, go right back to the chiropractors
Get my back right then I'm right back on you bastards
I was chasing the dragon, I don't know what happened
It's like the feeling I had when I first started rappin'
I just couldn't seem to get back and recapture that magic
So I went back to the lab, that's where I been at, when

[Chorus: Just Blaze]
Some people ask me, where I've been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody can save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted or try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, they say I'm crazy
They ask what me I think and I say maybe I'll fly away
And ain't nothing in the way so I may as well fly away
There ain't nothing else to say so I may as well fly away
I know you wanna see me down but we ain't gon' die today
'Cause I done been to the top and there's nowhere else to go
And the only way to see me's if you looking up from down below
And there's nothing else to say so I may as well fly away
And there's nothing in my way so I may as well fly away
I'm on top of this thing so I may as well fly away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I took a hiatus, haters now I'm back to cause trouble
Got the fucking shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles
I'm the *Explosion*, you ain't fucking sick, the hospital
Won't even give you cough drops for coughs cocksucker
You think you hot? You ain't even lukewarm
My puke's hotter than you, you're soft
I use fire to cool me off
I told them I would grow up one day and show them
I'd be able to choke clouds
Pick up lightning bolts and throw them
Take the world by storm with these words I form
Georgi-porgi kissed the girls, make the girls cry for it
Make 'em swarm, make 'em fight over the shirts I've worn
Swoon over my sweat towels, it's mind blowing
Yes I'm living the dream homie, can't nothing compare
Im so up, Im stuck in mid air, Im loving it yeah
It's like these people are steps now, all they do is stare
These haters are so pussy they afraid to be scared
This is pay back, like I owe 'em back pay
They spat in my face now I'm back to do them the same exact way
And leave this rap game with a bad taste
And slap it back out before I step back outta this crap, they
Slap me now I'm slapping them back hey, fuck it
We're slap happy, yeah okay, now I'm talking some smack, aye
And I ain't looking back, in fact, they can stare at my ass crack
How's that for hind sight, what the track say?

[Chorus: Just Blaze]
Some people ask me, where I've been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody can save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted or try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, they say I'm crazy
They ask what me I think and I say maybe I'll fly away
And ain't nothing in the way so I may as well fly away
There ain't nothing else to say so I may as well fly away
I know you wanna see me down but we ain't gon' die today
'Cause I done been to the top and there's nowhere else to go
And the only way to see me's if you looking up from down below
And there's nothing else to say so I may as well fly away
And there's nothing in my way so I may as well fly away
I'm on top of this thing so I may as well fly away



Yo yo yo

My mom sent me up to the store with a food stamp
For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the news stand (Here)
Two dudes ran up, jumped out of a blue van
I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch
I swung it at the first dude, the other one with him
Seen it snap so fast it looked like it broke before it hit him
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him and bit him
He came back with six or seven dudes screaming "Get him!"
I grabbed one, lit him on fire, pinned and bit him
The next faggot gave me his shoes like they didn't fit him
One by one I just kept droppin' 'em in a rhythm
Then I woke up swingin' in the middle of the kitchen

(Damn... damn... damn...)



[Intro: Eminem & Manix]
Yo man, yo Marsh, man
Yo, you've been kickin' all this shit about yourself
What of the homies, man?
Oh you want one about the posse? Alright

[Chorus: Eminem]
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride

[Verse: Eminem]
Well foolish pride has a lot of things to say
You got foolish pride, like you got tooth decay
But tooth decay is another problem
So let's take this ole foolish pride problem and solve it
Now, when I talk about foolish pride
I mean blacks and whites taking different sides
When blacks and whites take different sides
Unity never happens, and we will subside
We will subside and hatred will release
And everything will just crush that peace
But when we crush that peace, you see we start hatin' each other
But remember, you are my brother, and you are my sister
Just like I'm a mister
I seen a black girlfriend and I kissed her
I kissed her, I placed it on her cheek
And she didn't come back 'til next week
Now it was next week and she was back again
Wanting to kiss a white kid
So she was my girlfriend, we started going out
But that's okay because we were black and white
Blacks and whites sometimes mix
But black girls only want your money 'cause they're dumb chicks
So I'ma say like this
Don't date a black girl, take it as a diss
If you want, but if you don't
I'ma tell you like this, I surely won't
Never date a black girl because blacks only want your money
And that shit ain't funny
So I'ma say look honey
Why do you do this?
You know, you step up to me like you a Brutus
Then you try to grab my spinach
Because it's green and that's cash
So get outta here, 'cause I don't need your ass
I said that before, but that's okay because like I said you're a whore
Black girls and white girls just don't mix
Because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks
White girls are good, I like white girls
I like white girls all over the world
White girls are fine and they blow my mind
And that's why I'm here now telling you this rhyme
'Cause black girls, I really don't like
We don't mix, it's like riding a bike
When you're peddling hard, uphill both ways
You know it's kinda hard and that's why I say to you
I'm giving you a little advice
Don't date a black girl, if you do it once you won't do it twice
You won't ever do it again because they'll take your money
And that ain't funny
So I'ma say, "Look honey"
I thought I said that before
But like I said again you're nothing but a big whore
So when mike catch on the bass line
That's okay cause we will not just waste time
I'll get straight to the point, black girls are bitches
That's why I'ma tell you you better pull up your britches
Cause all that cash is making your ass drag
From the boyfriend you ganked and that's pretty bad
I mean that's pretty sad when you're dating a black guy
And then you turn around and fuck another big black guy
Now that's pretty wrong, but you're just ganking
But that's okay because you need a god damn spanking
From me, the funky M&M
I'm busting rhymes and I'm swallowing phlegm
I'm busting a freestyle just like this
I say "swallowing" phlegm and Howard gets pissed
But when Howard gets pissed that's okay
Because he leaves and he doesn't show up for two more days
So I'll just worry about that problem when I come to it
I'll cross that bridge when I come to it
'Cause I forgot the chorus
But that's okay cause y'all saying bust a rhyme for us
So I'ma bust another rhyme about this black girl
She turned out to be a fuckin' wack girl
A wack girl, because black girls ain't funny
All they want is your goddamn money
They take you for everything you've got
And then you stand with a bunch of snot
In your hand
So I'ma kick it to you just like this
How does the chorus go?
I forgot
But that's okay, 'cause I'ma tell you in stride
I'ma say, "Ole foolish pride"

[Chorus: Eminem]
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh
Date a white girl, 'cause they got the raw hide



[Verse 1]
Feeling kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's "Freaky Tales" (Biatch!)
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
And envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna stick her like she's decals
But when murdering females
Better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll
Be all up under her fingernails
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
I said "I'm here to do sink repairs."
Chop her up, put her body parts
In front of Steven Avery's trailer and leave 'em there

[Chorus]
But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

[Verse 2]
Woke up, it was dawn, musta knew somethin' was wrong
Think I'm becomin' a monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on, there's a Tonka Truck in the yard
But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond, 'cause it's incumbent upon me
Plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
Girl, that motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' out sections from it
Memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper
Cut my public defender's jugular then stuck him up in a blender
Another dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably
'Cause the disassembled body
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly
I'm wanted for questioning
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me

[Chorus]
But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

[Verse 3]
Still on the loose, they
Spotted me inside McDonald's Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap, lookin' like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J? The cops is on a goose chase
Just escaped from the state pen
For [edited] eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked
When I break in your basement
Under your baby's play pen, I lay in, wait adjacent
Facin' the door, remainin' patient while stayin' complacent
Blatant sexual implications are continuin' to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow in hopes, that when you get home
You'll get the hint, ho: I'm in your window
But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene
In a verse and be charged with first degree
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary
No, officer, you see ...

[Chorus]
I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed



Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse: Eminem]
You say I'm cold to the touch
Coulda told you this much
As I go for the gusto bending you over the hutch
But you're ready to spread
Can't tell if you're squirting

[Sound effect: gunshot]

[EMINEM]

Im a kick it
The motherfuckin liquid
That I be spittin
Infinite ammunition
Yeah you wishin
You try to step to this but you died
You tried to fuck with my style but get denied
And get hit
And get pushed back to the fuckin lab
When I stab you in the abdomen
When I grab a pen and jab it in

[EMINEM begins CANIBUS impression]

Travelin like an abdomen and gag you with it
Javelin when Im stabbing it and grabbin it
With the Canibus animal animus
Element jam it is
Whatever lattice magnanimous
And the shadow is adamant
The equilibrium will lay on top of these mathematics
In alphabetical order, Destroyer!



Die Bitches, Check it out bitches
All you bitch ass rappers
Need to get your clit repierced, Look at me, hip, I'm Britney Spears
Look at the way I wear my mascara
How you doing
I'm Pristina Gaguilera, And I sing songs about a genie in a bottle
And I'm Britney Spears
I got big tits, I'm a role model
To all little kids
But I got breast implants
That was the only way to get my chest enhanced
And here I go with the lyrical, miracle, spiritual everytime im incredible
With freestyles from the top that I drop
And my instinct
Is to kill N'Sync
And the Backstreet Boys
It really doesn't matter coz' I got a scratchy voice
Yo, check it out
But you ask me I ain't gonna be happy til' I see every member of the Backstreet Boys
Getting their ass beat
In the back seat of a taxi, And dropped of on the real backstreet
And somebody black sees five little rich white boys
Looking like faggots
With the N painted on the back of their jackets

[Proof]

Ohhhhh
And god damn it
Can't stop there
What's up?
It's over
And this just Some Bacardi and Mountain Dew

[Eminem]

And wonder how we tune is
Ten million



{Freestyle over Jay-Z's 'So Ghetto'}

[Intro: Eminem (Proof)]
Yeah. Now I'm getting distorted. (Can you turn it down) When I was...I should've been aborted. But it was too late...uh oh. (Uh oh) Yo, just turn up the beat a little bit. I don't care if the mic is distorted. Fuck it

[Eminem]
That's it, that's it, gotta hit than pass it
I'm blasted off a tab of acid
Flabbergasted
Hopped in a cab and blasted the cab driver
I said...haha
Hold on a minute
Give me infinite beats that I can kick for a minute
Y'all don't understand
The way that I got this mic in my hand
Killing any MC who stands or sits or walks
Or is handicapped
It doesn't matter, Mr. Handicap, hand me that
Haha
I clap hands with the rap fans
Jump in their wheelchairs and give 'em a lap dance
I'm the illest MC who will kill this
And what?
And Die Hard like who?
(Bruce Willis)
Thank you very much that's a fucking cliche
But I will rock the microphone and don't care about what he say
Or they say or I say or we say or them say
Eminem say shit that only Slim say
Or Slim says
Fuck a les
-bian in her ass
Korean or a...
Haha

[Interlude: Proof talking]
Ayo, let me try something. Uh uh uh uh uh uh. I'm not free in here, check it out

[Proof]
I rap if there was no rap within a soul clap
Expose wack rappers and smack 'em with my bozack
Flatten 'em like inner tubes
Punch my fist through the torso of thinner dudes
And when I'm in the mood make a serious winner lose
Get high of gin and booze

[Eminem]
Hahahaha
In an inner tube
While I'm in the nude
With a centerfold
In the winter cold

[Proof]
Ayo we give it though
Give me an envelope
I get open with Tim Westwood show
And Cypher Sounds I strike you down
Don't like the way you sound, you wack now
You got my style packed down or should I say down pack
Any MC's will tell you right now that you sound wack
Call us up and then we make noise then see shells
We shall prevail you faker than Lee Nails
And we tell D-12 to all those that don't know
Flow for flow we rocking your radio
How you feel right now?
C'mon Shady flow
Yo, yo, yo

[Interlude: Eminem and Proof talking]
[E] Yo, turn the beat up a little bit
[P] I know, it's like the beat is like mad low
[E] Hello, hello, hello, check, check, check
[P] Hello
[E] Check, check, check

{beat switches to LL Cool J's 'Ill Bomb'}

[E] What, what?
[P] Awwww shit
[E] Yo, turn it up a little bit
[P] Yeah, just turn it up, up, up, up
[Cypher Sounds] C'mon Tim turn it up
[E] Yeah, just turn it up Tim
[P] Let it be distorted. Yo, yo, yo

[Eminem]
Trapped in a cinema, in a material world
Criminal, cops scour the rural area thorough
Cause I kissed a girl, married a girl
Carried a girl to the cemetery, buried a girl
And I'm desperate, no one to mess with
Always get arrested for something domestic
And I kill the way you met me
You'll never catch me, cops can't sketch me
You can't upset me, no matter how bad
How mad you get me
Problem with y'all, I'm letting the Tec speak
Went from sweet to hard
Beat the odds
From no hoes to show, quit the pizza job
No more fools to rob, no more geeks to rob
No more stolen cars, no more Visa cards
(Visa cards)
Slim Shady
(Slim Shady and D-12)



[Verse: Eminem]
Come in spittin', with not writtin', non-fiction
Rappers try to step to this, with no prediction
It doesn't matter cause I'm smashin' and bashin' and crashin'
I hate rappers with a passion when I'm chilling with DJ Fashion
Yo, I need a frickin' kleenex, so I die like River Phoenix
When I'm chillin with Phoneix, with two Coronas
I'm on the microphone and I'm a own this
Yo, and I'm a bone this in Arizona
Yo, rappers that ain't able
That can't stay stable, I'm on two turn tables
With my man, but he doesn't matter cause he kicks lyrics galore
And he's only five foot four
Yo check it out I bust rhymes and get, groovy
My man got carded at a rated R movie
But it really didn't matter, he wasn't insulted
He said I'm 27 years old, yo, I'm an adult, kid
But, yo still, Slim Shady gets ill with the skill
And I'm a always bill and kill, my baby's mama
Just to piss the world off, just to piss the girls off
Yo I earl off
The top of the building, kill women and children
And then it hit me
Suddenly my wrists tried to slit me
Couldn't believe it, yo, ya'll can't conceive it
It's Slim Shady, I'll fuck a girl in her cleavage
Bleep that out, and you can keep it, just bleep it
Yo, y'all keep it a secret
I'm top secret, like pop secret
Rappers they don't wanna see
Slim Shady, I'm from the motherfucking, D
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha-ha-ha
Yo, yo Slim Shady



[Intro Proof] 
Shady records, aint nobody better than us
Shady records, more cheddar than us
Shady records, aint nobody better than us
Shady records

[Eminem]
I done figured this rap shit out, I map shit out strategically
Timing is everything, and it seems to be the key
To my success, I merked for me repeatedly
(GreenLantern) The evil genius
We done be, to beat MCs
Timing is everything, and it seems to be the key
Let 'em diss you first and respond immediately
In order to master, the art of war, don't start a war
Shit, not no more; we done scared 'em off, there are no more
Victims to sick; I'm fixin' to pick some and start shit
Aint got no pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at
Ain't got no more targets, shit, Irv and Jeff
We done beat 'em to death, Benzino in debt
There seems to just be no one left to bully; Bush is pussy
Why the fuck you think his name's Bush? Puss is bushy!
Ain't shit going on, shit, I've been getting so bored lately
I'm thinking of doing some shit to get you to go and hate me again
Tell the truth, I liked the shit better then, shit, I could spit better
I'm 'bout to kick this sick shit again, look:
The game just ain't the same, it's changing
Shit, Dre is quitting, Jay is quitting, now it's just wankstas
Just saying the same shit, it's fake and it's ancient
And It's making me so bored I'mma just make a new language
Fubba-u-cubba-kubba yubba obubba ubba
You-ba can subbabick my dadibbadick through a tuba!
Summa dumma lamma I'm not a human, I'm a suicidal supersonic
Suicidal Unabomber
You think I'm the new Osama, press thinks I'm the new Madonna
Jeffrey Dahmer left me with this legacy to carry on
A lot of talk and rumors on us, who's the hottest? To be honest
Hip hop ain't been the same since 2Pac moved to Cuba on us
[Outro Konartist]  Shaddy records, they aint better than us
Shaddy records, they aint making more cheddar than us
Shaddy records, they aint better than us
Shaddy records, muthafuckas more cheddar than us



[Eminem (Mr. Porter)]
Yea!
(What was that?)
Fuck that shit, I've got shit I'm doing (say)
Fuck that shit, I've got shit I'm doing (say)
Fuck that shit, I've got shit I'm doing (say)
Fuck that shit, I've got shit I'm doing (say)
Fuck that shit, I've got shit I'm doing
Fuck that shit, I've got shit I'm doing
Fuck that shit, I've got shit I'm doing
Fuck that shit, I've got shit I'm doing
I'm busy
I'm busy
I'm busy
I'm busy
Don't bother me, not me
Mr Porter, I'm busy
I'm busy
Tryin' to talk to the crowd (okay)
Goddamnit, you win


(This annonation was posted on unofficial lyrics of snippet)



[Intro: Noreaga]
Yea, yea, we back again, we doin' our shit, yo
Word up, I wanna hear some fly shit
You know what I'm sayin', some get high shit
Word up, I wanna hear some white boy shit, man
Yo, I wanna hear some Eminem, man
Talkin' about all that shit he be doin'

[Hook: Slim Shady]
You ain't into fuckin' drugs, fuck you
You don't do ecstasy, fuck you
You don't pop mushrooms, fuck you
If you don't wanna tab of acid, fuck you

[Verse 1: Slim Shady]
I'm nauseous in this place, I need some office space
The boss is late, I wanna slap the mustache right off his face
I'm ready to go postal, I'm so close
I can almost feel his throat with no pulse when I choke him
In ten seconds I'mma turn into Hulk Hogan
With a cigarette in his mouth
He tells me there's no smokin'
I'm sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
All I picture is kickin' his ass
When he's taking his ashes and flickin' 'em
I'm sick of these stamps
I'm sick of lickin' 'em, sick of stickin' 'em
I'm sick of lookin' at 'em, I'm sick of 'em
"Alright, Mr. Mathers, pick 'em up!"
No you pick 'em up! Bitch, stick 'em up
Get against the wall, senior citizens and all
I can't take this shit no more, everybody hit the floor
Get the door, close it and lock it
Put your wallets back in your pocket, I don't want dollars
Ain't none of us walkin' out of this office

[Hook: Slim Shady]
Faggot, fuck you, work at the post office, fuck you
Talkin' shit to me, tellin' me to take out
The goddamn garbage, fuck you
If you're a fuckin' dick, fuck you
If you're a white rapper, fuck you
Talk shit about Stretch? You're cool
But if you don't talk shit about Stretch, fuck you
If you're a fuckin' punk, fuck you
Talk shit about me, fuck you
You wanna battle me, fuck you
I ain't got to say shit to you but fuck you



[Verse]:

Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Smashed him over the fucking head with a peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with a 40 mixed up with formula 4D
Fuck a acid tab, I strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait till it absorbed in then I fell to the floor dead
No more, case closed end of discussion
I'm blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
Leave you in the aftermath of Holocaust and traumas
Across the the bombers, we blowin' up your house
Killing your parents, and coming back to get for mamas
And I'm as good as keeping a promise as ??
I ain't making no more threats. I'm doing drive by's in tinted corvettes like Vietnam war vets. I'm more a less sick in the head. Maybe more cuz I smoked cracked today, yesterday, and the day before. Sabadore walked the block with a labadore. Strapping more calaphawar than Al Salvador. Foul stou galore. Verbal calmaneur, coming together like a eyebrow on the shore. I'm the illest rapper to hold a corless. on the corner, looking for hookers to punch in the mouth for a roll of quarters. I'm meaner than with action beating James Senior, smacking his back with vacuum cleaner attachments. I grew up in a wild hood, was a hazardous youth. With a fucked up childhood that I use as an excuse. That made shit change when I kept the same mindstate since the 3rd time I failed 9th grade. You prolly think that i'm a negative person. Don't be so sure of it. I don't promote violence, I just encourage it. i'm inept with the sight of death, cuz I fall down a cement flight of steps and land inside a bed of spider webs. Throw cautions in the wind, you and a friend can jump off a bridge and if you live do it again. Shit why not! Blow your brain out. I'm blowing mine out, fuck it. You only live once, you might as well die now!

Verse 2 [Dr. Dre]:

I squat like a blunts tips, something cavi, making green like minch. gift rap vocals dispatch. with every attempt I had, this game shook up when dre took up. Every thug look up.  Got me on chill. eyes bloodshot every pill. Lay a nigga out like quill. clear the guilt! I rock corollas from low riders to henny toasters. cut off dead weight to own formulas culture, expect no invitation. Dre losing his stack. limits chances, and getting his black fan back. My reputation is like a tech nine. I got the best in the circle. three endless wrektime. see it faster than the eye can chase it. Dre be real, they just got potential they not activated. no illusion I have you caught up in a rapture. executive decisions, from the motha fucking!



[Royce Da 5'9']
Ryans a homocidal misfit
I write the solution of biophysics
On the side of a cliff and some hieroglyphics
This my admission to having violence psychotic
With the vile polish politics by the way Im higher than the Eiffel tower tip
I like writing but I will stick this pencil in your ass before I write ya shit
Pause, inhale hell n kush, us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push
Felons, crooks, going door to door like hes selling books, Dolly Parton style, melons mush
Now my bitch dancer, Im bout as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style, you probably rip ya pants off
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
Itd probably smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
They call me anchor man, Ill hold down the ship
Leave you niggas floating in water and go and drown a fish
Fuck Im fucking heinous, Ill make you fucking famous
Them lead showers is coming, fuck is you sayin

[Eminem]
Fuck, its fucking raining, shit, its lightening
Bitch, its thundering, cause Im hushing up Im a storm if you wonderin
Shit, shit you could muster up a thought, to take a toter? and a brain fart
Want urine in your face, all you had to do was say it
You wish you woulda just stayed pissed off in the first place
We came to monopolise the game
Illuminati is here, yeah, human oddities
At odds with us, just whats gotta be
Cause we started out cold and it snowballed
We froze, soon as we rolled up on these hoes
Alls we know is you over the bar like Limbo/ Limbaugh
You know who you are
So quit fucking the dark before we start callin you bizaare
Shit screw the boots, yall dun raped a pitbull
Fell in love with Shih-tzu
This is directed directly at you
And as for these hoes who dont know me from a can of paint
You must be huffin, fuck a ballsack if the taints cant take you on a date
You mistake me for a gentleman, your 2000 and late man, Will-I-ain't
Im the bad guy, type of guy that will drag 5 girls up on stage
Pour ice in their pants and the first one who pees gets a black eye

[Hook - Eminem]
You must be outta ya mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts
Bitch hang it up, this game is over

[Joell Ortiz]
Puffing loosies, watching I Love Lucy with Gary Busey
Crazy, how the fuck could you son me? Im Shady
Will there ever come a day when they could slay me?
I dont know, fifth month, black and yellow insect, maybe
Til then I kill the bad man tryna slay me
Everything you kick weak, your speak kung fu yazy
All my homeboys, 2.0 boys
Nickle, I just picked up a Phantom, look how it rolls, Royce!
Even if I wanted to quit, I aint got no choice
Verses keep coming, I should invoice my own voice
You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist
Hoes be like diamonds in your chain, man, so moist
Bang bang bang bang, house gang, chainsaw
Here to kill you pussys, dont ask what we came for
I write til my right arm veins sore
Forearm feel like Thors arm in a gang war
You hear that Yaowa, you know who finna file out
Definitively finish you, my fist stick out that eyeball
Piranha mentality with a jaws bite all night
Coming up, never saw light, but never lost sight

[Joe Budden]
Jets and movers, cess-poolers, meth abusers
You step to us, text rugers to respect the shooters
My men think in sync, roll with the best crew
Move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger
Welcome to nay hood, bigger than jects, G
Cheated death multiple times without riggin the deck
So Im well prepped if you just want war
Therell be blood everywhere, you be laying on the Louboutin floor
Its raw, you keep acting like you dont know Mouse, nigga
And you gon need the best doctors, house nigga
Guard your jewels and avoid large tools
Cause after I spill you at the light, you be in a car pool
Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told
They food for thoughts rotten, they gems are fools gold
Need results from my actions, mistakes Ill exonerate
Im Martin King staring at a picture of Obamas face
Talking funds, niggas aint never seen stock
I dont need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock

[Hook - Eminem]
You must be outta ya mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts
Bitch hang it up, this game is over

[Crooked I]
Takeoff, you invited inside of the mind of a psychotic rhymer
Im kind of a Dahmer, Im grinding
Now rappers are lining up jackers, Im climbing up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors, Im the genuine article
But read me wrong, get my gun and split you to particles, particles
Tell me when and Im there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like a limited fare
You got us pegged wrong, my circle dont fit in with squares
I smell shit and piss, know where its coming from
You stepped on number two just to be number one
Now Ima step on you, bring it to yo yard
Bogart for arts, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the west
Im Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart

[Yelawolf]
I got no Jim Beam in the liver
Getting head like clean clippers, with haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
When I throw up 16s like I drink liquor
You think you seen sick? Well, bitch, you aint seen sicker
Then Ill crack, and then Ill hop around in a hospital gown
Popping the trunk, my pumper stay cocking the round
I shit logs and I piss river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And thats as close as I get to a pyramid
Shit, they think Im Illuminati, so f-ckin ignorant
Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win, they say you a sin, but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing
Skinny-ass pants sagging, its only yourself you playing
Call me a clown, but you love where the clowns hanging
And the freakshows at the county carnival then you pay
Bitch, Im on a trapeze with no legs in the dark
Yelling Go Shady driving slower than an old lady
In an old 89, no piece if you pay me
Gimme peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes
Im getting paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago woulda broken most of you crazies
They call me crazy cause I made it
Bitch, you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lately
You aint fucking wit Budden, you aint got no choice with Royce
You dont wanna see the Crooked I, well, listen to Ortiz voice
That dirt road hit the 8 Mile, the porno boys
And if Marshall want me to clap, then homie, I deploy
Game over

[Eminem]
Yo, I dont think they heard you, tell em again
[Yelawolf]
Game Over



[Hook: Anna]
You can't let nobody stand in your way
You've just got to get back up yeah, you've just gotta get back up, ho-oh
And take down everything that you cannot change now
You've just got to get back up yeah, you've just gotta get back up, ho-oh

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey, what it is, world? Yeah, it's me again
Back before you, at your mercy, on bended knee again
No runnin' from the truth, as much as we pretend
That it ain't what it is, then it hits CNN
Apologies to my fans and my closest friends (I'm sorry)
For lettin' you down, I won't take you down this road again (uh-uh)
Most of you now sayin' "Whatever, here we go again"
Blogs, radio and television all goin' in
I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrassment (I gotta say)
I gotta say you fuckin' haters is hilarious (ha-ha!)
How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou?
Point your finger now with me looking down (down)
Same clown that was twitpicking at my wedding
On the same Twitter page disrespecting, wait a second
Never mind my imperfections, this a fact, remember that
No mistake's too great to recover and bounce back

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass with my bare hands and swallow it
Then spit it back in the faces of you racists
And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit
You Liberaces, Versaces and you Nazis
Watch me cause you thinkin' you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers wanna judge me cause you're not me
You'll never stop me, I'm top speed as you pop me
I came to save these new generations of babies
From parents who failed to raise 'em cause they're lazy
To grow to praise me, I'm makin' 'em go crazy
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me
And you fugazi if you think I'ma admit wrong
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sic'd on
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
A sick song to retaliate to and it's called
This kind of music, use it and you get amped to do shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Now we can say it ain't our fault if we never heard it
But if we know better, then we probably deserve it
Jihad is not a holy war, where's that in the worship?
Murdering is not Islam, and you are not observant
And you are not a Muslim
Israel don't take my side cause look how far you've pushed them
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the kush went
Complain about the liquor store, but what you drinking liquor for?
Complain about the gloom, but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listening to Pac ain't gon' make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts ain't gon' make it halt
If you don't become an actor, you'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt
Wash them down with diet soda, killing off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the world would gladly give a loan today
So if you ever miss a payment, they can take your home away

[Hook]



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, I get it
I run this rap shit, now guess who's back
You thought I left you, now why would I do that? (1, 2, 3)

[Verse]
They keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best
Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it
From the fact that I'm comin' back
Or maybe it's cause I ain't black, maybe it's because of that
Maybe it's because I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap
While I'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques
I'm still sick, how can I be sick this long
And I'm still alive, Magic Johnson of rhymes
I thrive on makin' my opponents think that I've died
That's when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there
Damn I forgot how much money he got
On the beach of St. Tropez, but your man don't lay
In the sun cause I don't tan, I burn, blood clot
When you gonna learn how much money we've earned
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25
And coulda retired at 29 in my 20's still
And Fif' here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit
And he ain't even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score
To go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store
And Shady hit the box office man, he knocked the socks off us
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay
I'm just a super easy modest MC, okay?
Til I hear the word has been, that's when I start spazzin'
Smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then
I'm the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards
I'm a blonde Dre, now gimme Kanye's glasses!



[Intro: Eminem]
Yo, mic-check (My dick)
Testing, one, two, fuck (My dick)
My nuts

[Verse 1: Eminem]
My attitude is worse than N.W.A's was
I'll battle you over stupid shit
And diss people who ain't have shit to do with it
Like Cool J does (My tattoo)
You see me standin' outside of your buildin'
Screamin', "Puffy is good, but Slim Shady is for the children"
I look at my life in a new light
Fuck it, give me two mics
I write songs for me, fuck what you like
You probably hear me rap half-hearted
'Cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryna get my porno career started (Oh, hell yeah)
Every place and event, been there, done that
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
Want a deal? Study these five chapters
Lesson 1, throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson 2, face 'em and diss 'em (What up, dawg?)
Don't give 'em a demo, kidnap 'em
(Come on, you're comin' with me, motherfucker, check this out)
And make 'em come to your basement and listen
Lesson 3, get a job at a label
Switch demos with Canibus and put yours on the owner's table
(Here, listen)
Lesson 4, know you heard this before
"Hey, let me get your number, I'll call you tomorrow for sure"
Don't act like a fan, you wanna get signed
Get the whitest A&R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can (Hey dude, come here)
Lesson 5, get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street
I ain't givin' you shit, bitch, don't even bother askin' me
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin'
'Cause I'm always shittin' when I'm rappin', like Master P (Ungh)
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones and stuffed it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah
Gave Alyssa Milano syphilis, mono and gonorrhea
And all three of my main girls said, "See ya"
'Cause Brandy and Monica walked in
And caught me fuckin' Aaliyah
I splish-splash while I'm takin' a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break 'em in half, take 'em and laugh
White trash, fuckin' your wife in the ass
While you're out siphonin' gas
For your lawn mower to cut the grass

[Chorus: Eminem]
So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
(Yo, why you diss me?)
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had
(A big dick)
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad (Nurse, nurse)
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad

[Verse 2: Eminem]
What a wonderful day, I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi, Rene (Oh, hi)
I was just about to toss a live grenade
In your driveway and drive away (What?)
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS?
Blood drippin' from it
Rippin' your stomach like a paper mch
You talk a lot of shit, but you was never ill, though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh
Jumped up, choked a giraffe
Snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin' wars, went on stage
And sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
And wiped my ass with his page in Source (Here)
The demon is here, I'm steamin' this year
I rip ********* voice box out and scream in his ear
It's not a gimmick, bitch, it's an image, I live it
Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it
"Yeah, I don't think this guy is well"
I'm high as hell, I'll beat you with a live cat
When I'm swingin' him by his tail
I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin', lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off, then sew your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered a prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin' to leave you disfigured
And stiffer than Christopher Reeves
I was dealing with strep throat
While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beating your knees
And walkin' through South Central L.A., bleeding in jeans
(Am I a Blood or a Crip?)
Wakin' up the next day in breathing machines
Flashin' back to bein' shot and repeating the scenes
On how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and Pac joke

[Chorus: Eminem]
So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad

[Outro: Eminem & Sway]
I know that makes you real mad, don't it? (Uh-huh)
That's right, Slim Shady (Yup)
Sway and Tech, sprayin' wreck (Bitch)
And we don't give a heck (Uh-uh)
Or a damn or a fuck or a shit
So suck my mothafuckin' dick
The Wake Up Show, let me tell you what it mean to me
It mean hard beats, hard rhymes, B-boys
Hip-hop, baby, all the way, forever

[Intro]
Ayo, dawg, I got some shit on my motherfuckin' chest
That I need to get off 'cause if I don't
I'ma fuckin' explode or somethin'
Now, look, this is the story about
Some little fuckin' girls that I know
It goes like this

[Verse 1]
It's so easy for me to make enemies any more, it's sickening
People are lookin' for an excuse to jump on my shitlist
Stickin' their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions
Now I'm in the position that I don't wanna be in shit
I never had no beef with you corny son-of-a-bitches
But now the shit is broken, you can't do nothin' to fix it
So I'm tellin' you right now, motherfuck a Limp Bizkit
Now I'ma be real, B-Real was real
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin, see, he chilled
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
I'd have never involved my crew if it wasn't for pupils
Peoples, whatever your backpackin' cipherin' name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you were sayin' and
I'da never involved you, but you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shitlist and add some new enemies
Hit the studio and I'll admit, I had a few in me
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
But let it be known that song was never released, it leaked
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV, now look who's mentioning me
That little fuckin' weasel, DJ Lethal, on MTV
After I gave you props in that song, you on national TV
Talkin' 'bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me?
Come on, dawg, he was s'posed to be on that song
Talkin' 'bout how bad you hate him, now you all on his thong?
What's wrong? You scared? And Fred, you said you was dissin' him too
I shoulda knew better than to listen to you
You fuckin' sissy, up on stage, screamin' how people hate you
They don't hate you, they just think you're corny since Christina played you
And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back
That's a sissy act, and don't call me kissin' my ass
'Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song, I'm tryna to pre-warn you
Lethal, when I fuckin' see you, dog, I'm swingin' on you!
Motherfuckers must think 'cause I'm in trouble with the law
That I won't jaw 'em, up my sentence and double it tomorrow
Y'all some...

[Hook]
Girls (Y'all are some goddamn girls)
Why do you act this way? (Why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fuckin' sissies, you pussies
Keep talkin' shit behind my back, you just some bitches for that
And we all know (we all know, hah)
How fuckin' cowards roll (Keep rollin' rollin' rollin'!)
In fuckin' Bentleys and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down

[Post-Hook]
Now, I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'Cause I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

[Verse 2]
Now see if you diss me and I respond, the beef is on
But if I help you sell one record
And I see you at a show, I'll strip you naked
See, I was smart, I came back and scooped up my friends
Now I got five dawgs that'd die for me like I'd die for them
I'd fight for them, swing or shoot like I fight for Kim
All of 'em been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in
That goes for all of my dawgs, from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Mel-Man, 'til I'm hoist away
In my coffin I'll never soften, no matter how often I'm tested
I'll never give a fuck, I won't never be interested
Love me or hate me as much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I stated
This shit that I been through my pencil never could pencil
But I will never be this gullible ever again no, nope
Next time I'll know when someone's copyin' off me
I'm not bein' cocky, I just know when somebody's mockin' me
I stick up my middle finger, he sticks up his finger (hey!)
I say, "Fuck Christina!",  he says, "Fuck Christina!", but meaner
So from doin' a song with Method to beggin' to get accepted
I'm peggin' Fred with the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
And as for Lethal, don't forget what I said
I'm fuckin' you up, punk, you're dead! Don't think that I'm playin'!
And fuck Bizkit! 'Cause I know you're sayin', "Fuck D12!"
Only not to our face, under your breath to yourselves
Little ...

[Hook]
Girls (Motherfuckin' females)
Why do you act this way? (Why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fuckin' sissies, you pussies
Keep talkin' shit behind my back, you just some bitches for that
And we all know (we all know the truth)
How fuckin' cowards roll (Keep rollin' rollin' rollin'!)
In fuckin' Bentley's and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down

[Post-Hook]
Now, I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'Cause I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

[Outro]
And that's it, that's all there is to it, dawg
If you didn't wanna do the fuckin' song
Don't say you're down with doin' the fuckin' song
And then back out at the last minute
And then go on motherfuckin' MTV talkin' about
Everlast can whip my motherfuckin' ass
If you're scared of Whitey Ford, dawg
Just say you're scared of Whitey Ford, that's it
That's all you had to fuckin' say, I wouldn'ta said shit
I woulda backed off, did the motherfuckin' song myself
And not put you motherfuckers in it, that's all
Now, I ain't even on no rap shit no more
I'm on some fuckin-you-up-shit when I see you
And I will see you, too
Oh, and by the way, Fred
That wasn't an accident
I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards
Haha!



[Verse 1: Eminem]
My name is Chauncey Billups, I'm kind of like a raunchy Phillips
Screwdriver, my crew's liver when you can't sleep and you're still up
I get the ball and I'm like Rip, you can't get a grip
You probably got stripped, you wanna rumble, no reason to trip
I grab her like Gnarls Barkley holds the mic, your snarls spark me
I smile like Charles Barkley come on I'm hard, guard me
Aint booin, aint pursuin, no lawsuits, I aint suin
I know what Im doin, give me the ball and your life is ruined
I'm like Rasheed, I remind me the spirit of Proof
I'm happy and lucky, ballin' and groovin', I'm on the move
I'm smooth with it, give me the ball, you don't know what to do with it
Shoot it in the basket, you other teams need a casket
LeBron sayin' don't respond, there's no back and forth
This game is mental, man, I play aloud and walk away just to hush the crowd
You trying to touch? Sit down

[Hook: Eminem]
Detroit basketball
Homie like I told you this is Detroit basketball
Man I don't think you ready for the

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I get the crowd rolled up Like a U-Haul truck
Just call me 2 Ball Chuck, ain't too tall what
I'll leave Utah stuffed
Man I love this game, who the hell you called up?
You need points on the paint, I'm the joints when they stained
All my coins in the bank and we're going all the way
Yeah baby it's true, I'm talking to you
You already know what to do
Just pass to me, it just so happens to be
That I adapt with this heat so strap in your seat
I got a grasp on this beat, you ain't convinced?
Give it to Tayshaun Prince, we haven't stayed calm since
Leave the ball with delayed palm prints

[Hook: Eminem]
Detroit basketball
Homie like I told you this is Detroit basketball
Man I don't think you ready for the

[Outro: Eminem]
We get everybody involved homie, we get everybody involved
I said we get everybody involved homie,we get everybody involved
Yeah
Ahh
I said ahh
Give me the ball
You gotta walk before you crawl
Tell me you ain't listenin
This is Detroit basketball Homie, hey yo
Beam me up Scottie
Hahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaa



[Intro]
And Im willing to borrow your grass
But I specialize in eating MC's
In the immortal words of LL Cool J
As he would say: "I'm a G.O.A.T.!"
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the Greatest Of All Time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes

[Verse 1]
This is the part I was worried about
Everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
And I'm in some dusty garage
Inhalin' them carbon monoxide fumes
And everyone's tellin' me what I should do
And how I should come out and what to rap about
And I know I got a lot up
In my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out
And I'm not sure how this is gonna come off
They're probably gonna think that I'm comin' off as cocky
Like I just started givin' a fuck what you really think about me
See, the thing about me
Is you don't really know a thing about me
Everyone's makin' a stink about me
Like there's some kind of an aura of that of the king around me
Surround me with nothin' but gangsters
Killers and bangers and the most dangerous criminals
And I feel like I'm more comfortable around them
Than I do my own motherfuckin' neighbors
But see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave
But why does it seem like I'm not even put up in the same category as other MC's?
So when Weezy says that he's better than Jay Z
Please be that just subliminally
Means he thinks Jigga's the best
And that he's the only one up in that league, see
And it's easy just to consider me
One of the greatest white rappers there is
Knowin' goddamn well that I'm one of the best motherfuckin' rappers who ever lived, period

[Hook]
I'm a G.O.A.T. and I don't mean to gloat
But I know what I know and I know what you think
And these magazines'll never put it in ink
Because how would it look if they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the Greatest Of All Time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes

[Verse 2]
Maybe they figure that I'm on my way out the game
So they gotta go try to find 'em a new Eminem or a new Shady
If they think it's gonna happen, man, I thought I was crazy
Or maybe I could be takin' it wrong
And they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way
So let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
See, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringin' up that Paul Wall's white
Cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see, he's just aight
And Bubba Sparxxx, he just won't write
Because he's so caught up in that snow white
That Timbaland can't even get him in the studio
He's so gone off that coke, right?
And it's so sad cause he's dope, right?
America's next great white hope, right?
So now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny-ass White Rapper Show, right?
And which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about
They said it'd be real, I'm just spillin' it out
There's somethin' about a white boy talkin' black
And runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth
And I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit
"Isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white
And the best golfer's black?"
And I'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack off of that
But these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until 8 Mile had came out
But I had already hit middle America
Parents had all got to likin' me now
When suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy
All of the hatred for me must've died
Thought I committed career suicide
So I had to turn back into the bad guy
So faggoty faggoty faggoty gays
Anatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy
Not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy
And Angelina Jolie is just another ho
And Brad is a sucka, because once I fuck her
She wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby
You know what I say?  "No."
You better save some of them kids from Madonna
She needs all the publicity she can get
You wanted Shady, well you got it, man, I ain't apologizin' for shit

[Hook]
I'm a G.O.A.T. and I don't mean to gloat
But I know what I know and I know what you think
And these magazines'll never put it in ink
Because how would it look
If they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the Greatest Of All Time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes

[Outro]
Man, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home
Man, shit is too easy
Nobody even wants to pass me the ball
Cause I'm a G.O.A.T.
So don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game
And y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best
But y'all know that I'm a G.O.A.T.
And like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best
Before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch
But before I go, I'd like to say fuck you very much
To everybody who wasn't there from the start
And thank you very much to everybody who was
And y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it
Cause I know that you know that I know
That you know that I know that I'm a G.O.A.T.
I'm out y'all, it's been realpeace!



[Intro: Groove Coverage]
God is a girl!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the [motherfuckin'] kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're probably sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!
Look so ridiculous now, look so ridiculous now
Look so ridiculous now, make you look so ridiculous now
Now, now, now, now, now, now...

[Verse 2: Groove Coverage]
Remembering me, discover and see
All over the world, she's known as a girl
To those who are free, their minds shall be keep
Forgotten as the past, 'cause history will last

[Chorus: Groove Coverage]
God is a girl, wherever you are
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, whatever you say
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, however you live
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, she's only a girl
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?

[Verse 3: Eminem]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, overblaow!
Snap back to reality, there goes gravity
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo!

[Interlude: Eminem]
One shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My [faggot] father must have had his panties up in a bunch
Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just [fuckin'] wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest [shit] I did was take the bullets out of that gun
Cause I'da [killed him, shit], I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Chorus: Groove Coverage]
God is a girl, wherever you are
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, whatever you say
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, however you live
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, she's only a girl
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?

[Verse 5: Eminem]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' optionfailure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Outro: Groove Coverage]
God is a girl!



[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Lately I really feel like I'm rollin' for delf
Like Philly, feel like I'm losin' control of myself
I sincerely apologize if all that I sound like
Is I'm complainin' but life keeps on complicatin'
And I'm debatin' on leavin' this world this evenin'
Even my girls can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it
But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside I'm dyin'? I am finally realizin' I need
Help, can't do it myself, too weak
Two weeks I've been havin' ups and downs goin' through peaks
And valleys, dilly-dallyin' 'round with the idea
Of endin' this shit right here,  I'm hatin' my reflection
I walk around the house tryna fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah I look fat
But what do I care? I give a fuck
Only thing I fear's Hailie, I'm afraid if I close my eyes, that I might see her... shit

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon
Yeah, Dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you
Marshall, what happened that you can't stop with these pills?
And you've fallen off with your skills and your own fans are laughin' at you
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle? Get up
Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that, he wouldn't fuckin'
Shoot at nobody, he'd fight first, but dwellin'
On it only makes the night worse, now I'm poppin' Vics, Percs
And Methadone pills, "Yeah, Em, tight verse
You killed it!" Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men
And they gon' do whatever I says when I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then

[Chorus: Eminem (& Ozzy Osbourne)]
(I'm going through changes) Dont know what Im gonna do
(I'm going through changes) But I just keep on going through changes

[Verse 3: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
My friends can't understand this new me, that's understandable
Man, but think how bananas you'd be, you'd be an animal too
If you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do?
I'm startin' to live like a recluse
And the truth is, fame's startin' to give me an excuse
To be at an all-time low; I sit alone in my home theater
Watchin' the same damn DVD of the
First tour; the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurts so I fast forward, sleeping pills'll make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I'll just take a couple more, yeah, you're motherfuckin' right
I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie, come on, dole 'em out!
"Daddy, don't you die on me! Daddy, better hold your ground!"
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice? Yeah, baby, hold me down (Daddy!)

[Chorus: Eminem, Hailie Jade (& Ozzy Osbourne)]
(I'm going through changes) (Daddy!) Dont know what Im gonna do
(I'm going through changes) But I just keep on going through changes

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, but somehow I'm pullin' through
Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof
I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few
Facts, 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit, it just hit me that what if I would not've made it through?
I think about the things I woulda never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailie, this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together, hey
Wish there was a better way for me to say it
But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things to explain, when it rains
Guess it pours  yes, it does, wish there wasn't any pain
But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame
I ain't pointin' fingers, Heaven knows I've never been a saint
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today I looked at your picture, almost if to say
I miss you subconsciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away, don't know why, I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm

[Chorus: Eminem (& Ozzy Osbourne)]
(I'm going through changes) Dont know what Im gonna do
(I'm going through changes) But I just keep on going through changes



[Verse: Eminem]
Here we go aga-ain, from heroes to villains
Used to be your Romeo but we both were jilted
A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
But still, it gave me hope that we'll get
Through it together, a severed earlobe
Mailed to you in a E-N-V-elope
Would be dope, but what kind of lengths can you go?
Pull a Vincent van Gogh, just to convince a damn ho
To be a housewife who outright lies
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive
I ran outside, why is she tryna act out?
She's just about my size, hit me in the mouth twice
Guys, when someone you'd die for
Sticks a steak knife in your heart, do you try more?
Another late night in, she stumbles through my door
Lets the daylight in and all we do's fight more
And I ain't violent, but she's goin' through my drawers
To plant the K-Y in, I'm gettin' accused by a whore
Who smells like St. Ides and who's prob'ly screwed five more
Guys, sucked eight/nine men
I'm takin' two-by-fours to our eight-by-tens
Bitch, it's you I tore out the frame, I win
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
And here's some two-ply for when you date my friends
In order to wipe your ass when you moved your bowels
When we renewed our vows, this the thanks I get?
I'm waitin' for the day I can
Hear you say, "Marshall, what a skank I've been."
"And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him."
Got your tubes tied for him, got that boob job for him
Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in
After you, I swore to make the gray skies end
Here come the rays like when
You get a pay hike and
Am I the good guy or do I just play like him
And hope that he dumps you?
It's like a dream come true, just to scream, "Fuck you!"
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in
Since

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
Since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty
They'll call me guilty
You bought the jury, they'll call me guilty
Even though you know the real me
You can't beat a cheater, convince a nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out
But I'll let you say that you're the good guy
'Cause this ain't what love looks like
You can't beat a cheater, convince a nonbeliever
I ain't in my feelings, I'm out
But I'll let you say that you're the good guy
Play like you're the good guy
Play like, play like, play like you're the good guy



[Verso: Eminem]
Aqu vamos de nuevo, de hroes a villanos
Sola ser tu Romeo pero ambos estbamos abandonados
Un par de veces, por lo que tuvimos una pendiente resbaladiza para hacer frente a
Pero an as, me dio la esperanza de que obtendremos
A travs de ella, un lbulo cortado
Enviado a usted en un S-O-B-re
Sera drogadicto, pero a qu tipo de longitud puedes ir?
Tire de un Vincent van Gogh, solo para convencer a un maldito ho
Ser una ama de casa que miente abiertamente
Ella est borracha, ahora est de vuelta en mi camino
Sal corriendo, por qu est intentando actuar?
Ella es casi de mi tamao, me golpe en la boca dos veces
Chicos, cuando alguien por quien moriras
Pega un cuchillo de carne en tu corazn, intentas ms?
Otra tarde en la noche, ella tropieza a travs de mi puerta
Deja entrar la luz del da y todo lo que hacemos es luchar ms
Y no soy violenta, pero ella est revisando mis cajones
Para plantar el K-Y, una puta me est acusando
Quien huele a San Ides y quien probablemente haya jodido cinco mas
Chicos, chuparon ocho / nueve hombres
Me llevo dos por cuatro a nuestro ocho por diez
Perra, eres t, arranqu el marco, gano
Poner un nuevo puntaje alto, venci a este juego en el que estoy
Y aqu hay algunos de dos capas para cuando salgas con mis amigos
Para limpiarte el culo cuando moviste tus entraas
Cuando renovamos nuestros votos, este es el agradecimiento que recibo?
Estoy esperando el da que pueda
Te oigo decir: "Marshall, qu gilipollas he sido!
Y hay un chico nuevo, ests siendo reemplazado por l "
Tengo sus tubos atados para l, tengo ese trabajo de tetas para l
Me duele hasta la mdula, pero el dolor en el que estoy
Despus de ti, jur hacer cesar los cielos grises
Aqu vienen los rayos, como cuando se obtiene una subida de sueldo y
Soy el chico bueno o solo juego como l?
Y espero que te deje?
Es como un sueo hecho realidad, solo para gritar "Vete a la mierda!"
Supongo que tomas la vida de la misma manera que juegas dados
Porque solo me miras y les pones los ojitos de serpiente
Ya que-

[Coro: Jessie Reyez]
Desde que compraste el jurado, me llamarn culpable
Me van a llamar culpable
Usted compr el jurado, me llamarn culpable
Aunque sabes el verdadero yo
No puedes vencer a un tramposo, convence a un no creyente

I done figured this rap shit out, I map shit out strategically
Timing is everything and it seems to be the key
To my success I've murked for me-uh... (slurs words) repeatedly
(Laughter and slurs words) to beat MCs
Timing is everything and it seems to be the key
Let 'em diss you first and respond immediately
In order to master the art of war, don't start a war
Shit not no more, we done scared 'em off, there are no more
Victims to sic, I'm fixin' to pick some and start shit
Ain't got no pictures to rip and shit to throw darts in
Ain't got no more targets, shit Irv and Jeff
We done beat 'em to death, Benzino in debt
It seems to just be no one left to bully, Bush is pussy
Why the fuck you think his name's Bush? Bush is bushy
Ain't shit going on, shit I been gettin' so bored lately
I'm thinkin' of doing some shit to get you to go and hate me again
Tell the truth I like the shit better then
Shit I can spit better, I'm bout to kick that shi-shit again
Look, the game just ain't the same, it's changin'
Shit Dre's quittin', Jay's quittin', now it's just wanksta
Sayin' the same shit, it's fake and it's ancient
It's makin' me so bored I'ma just make a new language
Fubba you cubba cubba, ubbu you ubbu ooba
Yooba can subba my dibidick through a tubba
Suma newma lama, I'm not a human
I'm a suicidal super sonic suicidal uni-bomber
You think I'm the new Osama, press think I'm the new Madonna
Jeffrey Dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on, uh
Lotta talk and rumors on us, who's the hottest? To be honest
Hip-hop ain't been the same since 2Pac moved to Cuba on us

"No...you hear me! You go to hell" -] Mr. Garrison

Verse One [Eminem]:
Yo
At birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth
The first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt
Mom wouldn't take me
The bitch still hates me
Shit, one day she said, "Go rake leaves,"
I said, "Make me!"
I'm proud to announce I was probably the first kid
Who was kicked out of his house
For making fart sounds with his mouth
Arguing with me and mom was on-going
She called law enforcement when I broke the law mower
The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen
I went to start it and it screamed, "Please fix me!"
Back then, when Will Smith was still the Fresh Prince
And him and Jeff were still best friends, I guess then
I decided to cut class to rap full time
And get the fuck outta this fake ass school and rhyme
Anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick
Come and see me, see if I don't live up to this image
You fuckin' pricks!

Scratching:

"No...you hear me! You go to hell" -] Mr. Garrison

Verse Two [Obie Trice]:
How the fuck you gonna fuck with O Trice with a staff full of hoes
With one gat and a wack stack of flows?
A whole lot of lip
Thicker than Obie's shit
Oh shit they found your ass floatin' in the ocean
Body part corroded
Cast away
You stretched in a cast today
That's how a real bastard play
Do shit the bachelor way
Creek niggas will blast away
Y'all niggas ain't tough
Y'all niggas funny
Y'all need to roll on WB 20
Niggas think they 2Pacalypse Now
Until they catch a buckshot
Chicken pop a nigga's style
Niggas scared of the firm
Slim, Dirty Dozen and Trice
Come back like thieves in the night
Niggas jump, that's reason to fight
That's reason to rearrange your teeth with the right
Motherfucker



[Verse 1: Eminem]
I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe 'til I see what I wanna see
And what I wanna see is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently; you're just being hurt
This ain't gonna work for me, it just wouldn't be
Sufficient enough 'cause we are just gonna be
Enemies as long as we breathe, I don't ever see
Either of us comin' to terms where we can agree
There ain't gonna be no reasonin' speakin' with me
You speak on my seed, then me no speak-a Ingls
So we gonna beef, and keep on beefin', unless
You're gonna agree to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face-to-face, and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me that you've never seen
And you're gonna see this gangster pee on himself
I see you D12, and thanks, but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need 15 of my homies
When I see you, I'm seein' you, me and you only
We never met, but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close to see you exposed as phony
Come on, bitch, show me! Pick me up, throw me!
Lift me up, hold mejust like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all of you, Ja, you'll get it too

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker, die!
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close your eyes!
Go to sleep, bitch! Why are you still alive?
How many times I gotta say, close your eyes!
And go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker die!
Bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep, bitch! Why are you still alive?
Why? Die, motherfucker! Ah, ah, ah, go to sleep, bitch!

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
We got you niggas nervous, on purpose
To hurt your focus, you's not MC's
You's worthless, you's not them G's
You's a circus, you's no appeal, please
You's curtains, you use words Kool Herc slurred
In two-thousand-third: you's perpin'
You's no threat, who's you servin'?
When lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseein' the Earth
Shady, mothafucka, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold I become more cursed
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse
Is he who depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You's not the streets, you's the desk
Use not your chest, nigga, use a vest
Before tools choose your rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker, die!
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close your eyes!
Go to sleep, bitch! Why are you still alive?
How many times I gotta say, close your eyes!
And go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker die!
Bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep, bitch! Why are you still alive?
Why? Die, motherfucker! Ah, ah, ah, go to sleep, bitch!

[Verse 3: DMX]
Hey dog, I'ma walk like a beast, talk like the streets
I'ma stay blazin' New York with the heat
Stalk on the beat, walk with my feet
Understand my pain, the rain ain't sleet
Peep how I'm movin', peep where I'm goin'
Shit don't seep, then sleep not knowin'
But I'ma keep growin', gettin' larger than life
Easy goin' with the same one that started the fight
He be knowin' how dog get when dog don't bite
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
Grand Champ, and my Blood Line is tight
'Cause it's all good, it's all right
Niggas tried to holla but couldn't holla back
Now they got to swallow everything in the sack
Blood Line, and we can go track for track
Damn, dog, why'd you have to do them niggas like that?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker, die!
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close your eyes!
Go to sleep, bitch! Why are you still alive?
How many times I gotta say, close your eyes!
And go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker die!
Bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep, bitch! Why are you still alive?
Why? Die, motherfucker! Ah, ah, ah, go to sleep, bitch!

[Outro: Eminem]
All you motherfuckers, take that!
Here, take this too, bitch!
Uh, uh, uh, uh, wahoo
We're killing all you motherfuckers dead
All of you! Fake-ass gangsters!
No more press! No more press!
Rot, motherfuckers, rot!
Decay, in the dirt, bitch, in the motherfuckin' dirt!
Die nameless, bitch! Die nameless!
No more fame! Ahh, hahahaha
Yo, X, come on, man! Obie, let's go! Ha ha



[Intro]
Motherfuckers talkin' crazy (Yeah)
Sayin I should quit (Ah)
I fuckin' tell 'em make me (Bitch)
Eat a fuckin dick (Yeah)
I'm feelin' like the greatest (Woo!)
On the beat who ever did it
Mike WiLL the one who made it
It's Shady on the lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day (Yeah!)
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
Im turnin back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglias an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
Breakin' your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain (Ayy)
Feelin' like I'm headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me when I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are
Looked at as a failure (Yeah)
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper
'Cause damn it I'm still the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

[Verse 2]
So you sold 10 million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out 10 million albums, eh? (Haha)
Wait, what was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way
I mispronounced a name, "DIE ANTWOORD!"
Fuck, I still can't say this shit, but how quickly they forget
Who the fuck I was; now Ninja try to duck my slugs
You let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress (Woo!)
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shoutnow get the fuck out my rhyme book!
No more shiners, already too much time tokin' rappers
I hear you talkin' shit, I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
You don't got the tools I got in my toolkit (Bitch!)
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot
That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you can call it a nostril 'cause it's-snot gonna ever
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wipin' up everyone in this genre
'Cause on the mic I feel like I'm the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention (What?)
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
I love contentions, so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (Yeah)
Psychopath, Michael's Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I should slap Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad (Uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gunpowder and split the scene
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips are the clips got the cig lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean (Prr!)
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M16s (woo!)
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee
You ain't harmin' a thing
I hit a ding hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band
You gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
And nominally I'm Muhammad Ali
'Cause I knew one day I'm gonna be the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest



Met a retarded kid name Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with a 40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and formula 44-D
Fuck an acid tab, I strapped the whole sheet to my forehead
Waited 'til it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leavin' you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers, we blowin' up your house
Killin' your parents, and comin' back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keepin' a promise as Nostradamus
'Cause I ain't makin' no more threats
I'm doin' drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head, maybe more
'Cause I smoked crack today, yesterday, and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a Labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin' together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!



[Intro]
"What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare."

[Verse 1]
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
'Til one day I grew suspicious
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start anew, but ditchin'
Missouri for Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone, put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom, please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, bitchin, her rules are Krypton-ite
So the walls, I done lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into 'em, runnin' through the kitchen
Pretendin' to be blind Superman, 'cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though, I could turn into Invisible Kid
Disappear out of sight like a true magician
And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new but different
Music into the picture, and it became my new religion

[Interlude]
"I remember it clearly, even today."

[Verse 2]
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Nan
Always itchin' for somethin' to do, was flippin'
Through the radio stations one day
And discovered this DJ who was mixin'
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to The Wizard
You ain't have a fuckin' clue what you was missin'
I'd zone out with my headphones
All I remember doing's wishin' for shoes
Fuck them stupid Pumas, bitch!
It's all about them new edition Troops
You get them LL Cool J coolin' system
Made that final manoeuvre to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this
That's how I knew my mission
Little boom box boomin', spittin'
Practicin' numerous writtens
When I'd sit in my room, envisionin' my dreams come to fruition
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit
He'd go cuckoo ballistic, go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us two existed
To do this shit; never quit, too persistent

[Interlude]
"Carved an underground empire."

[Verse 3]
Started a group of misfits, Proof had a proposition
If we all band together, there ain't no stoppin' this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
If you got dissed at the Shop, 'cause if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin'
You, and you forgot your written
Opportunity knocks once, it ain't knockin' again
It tried ding-dong ditchin' shit, I fuckin' got that bitch in
A headlock, cut off its oxygen, Slim
Is not budgin' like cocksuckin' cinder blocks in the wind
Now I got a pot to piss in
Spot in that top position, koppin' over the opposition
Lookin' like a dog that's pissin', leg up on the competition
Promisin' complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Ali's my colleague bombin' 'em
Probably end up on top of 'em
Stompin' 'em like Ndamukong
I'm Russian like a Ukrainian, LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face, competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place
To battle, bitch, I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words
Is loose, but you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts  shit, no wonder you're sore losers!
Now where's your poo, birds?
Ooh, no more trippin' in bird shit
Songs of self-empowerment surgin'
Words of encouragement, but discouragin'
The rappers, the rap game's god
But the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells
Since yours ain't workin' out, each verse is
More merciless than the first is
And you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this bitch
To get served, bloodthirst revenge of the nerds, chka

[Interlude]
"That you'll not escape my vengeance."

[Verse 4]
But the dumpy kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
Word to Uncle Ron, I'm turnin' into a non-humble Don
You blonde dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on
So start the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on
Better back away from the front row, get launched
Show you I'm bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo
On the fuckin' Jumbotron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna rumble, you bomboclaats
I'll leave you stretched out like a fuckin' yawn
So mow the fuckin' lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fuckin' up this whole landscape of rap
The G.O.A.T. just ate eight acres, an eighth of that
Was just to make a path
And take it straight to your favorite rapper
Oh, look, my notebook looks smoke-cooked
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
Charred debris floatin' like Oakwood
Was burnin', return of the no good and I won't quit

[Interlude]
"And the next thing I know
Something came crawling up from below
Something that made Godzilla look like a blamed..."

[Hook]
And I don't quit, won't change
It's like a Groundhog's Day
So crowd around, y'all, 'cause you may
See if I popped your head

[Bridge]
I'm a monster, mutt
I'ma turn into a monster
I'm a monster, mutt
With my dick in your mouth all day!

[Outro]
"I'm not so sure I want to know from whence it came
But the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed
There, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thing."



[Intro: Mark Avery & Eddie]
Meet Eddie, 23 years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
(Damn, I'm going fucking insane)
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre, Eminem, & (Eddie)]
Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)
Not over this shit (Stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude

[Skit: Stan, Girl]
Come on, just come in here for a minute
I don't know
Look, look, look
Damn
Look, it's gonna be alright, alright?
O-okay
Look, give me a kiss, pull your pants off, come on

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Stan, 21 years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh-huh)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog, then bail

[Interlude: The Isley Brothers, Mark Avery, (Grady), & Grady's Wife]
Here I lay
(Man, it feels good to be home)
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man
(What the fuck?) Grady

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, motherfucker
Uh-uh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?

Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Bump that, do that sh**, hit that lick
Can you afford to blow this hit? Are you that rich?
Why you care if you scared of death? Are you that chick?
Do you really think she gives a **** if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (Youre right)
Not over this slit (Stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Dont even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I dont like your attitude

[Chorus: Eminem & Mark Avery]
These voices, these voices, I hear them
And when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow, Ill follow
(All these voices, these voices) Meet Stan, 21 years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party (I hear them, hear them)

Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom

Once again, his conscience comes into play (All these)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little chicken's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
How could you take advantage of her? She's passed out
It's easy, just cut these lights out, that's how
Then pick this chicken up, get her off Brad's couch
And leave her on the front porch at her mom and dad's house
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest (Doobiest)
You wanna get hauled off to jail?
Bump that, drop her off, ring the doorbell, then bail

[Chorus: Eminem & Mark Avery]
These voices, these voices, I hear them
And when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker

Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Start breathin'? Man, you just caught your wife cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Forget gettin' divorced, cut this chicken's head off
Wait, what if there's a good explanation for this?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his ****?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna grab her?
Kick her our the house, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?

Uh-uh, temper, temper

And when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow
(All these voices, these voices) Meet Stan, 21 years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party (I hear them)
(And when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow)
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
(I'll follow, I'll follow)
Once again, his conscience comes into play (All these)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little chicken's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
How could you take advantage of her? She's passed out
It's easy, just cut these lights out, that's how
Then pick this chicken up, get her off Brad's couch
And leave her on the front porch at her mom and dad's house
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest (Doobiest)
You wanna get hauled off to jail?
Bump that, drop her off, ring the doorbell, then bail

[Chorus: Eminem & Mark Avery]
These voices, these voices, I hear them (Hear them, hear them)
I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow (I'll follow)
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker
(These voices, these voices, I hear them, hear them)
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
(I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow)
To find his wife in bed with another man

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Start breathin'? Man, you just caught your wife cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Forget gettin' divorced, cut this chicken's head off
Wait, what if there's a good explanation for this?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his ****?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna grab her?
Kick her our the house, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, you lil mothaf-
Uh-uh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the hell you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, **** it, what am I sayin'?
Do 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?







[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Stan, 21 years old. After meeting a young girl at a rave party, things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom. Once again, his conscience comes into play

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now listen to me, while you're kissing her cheek
And smearing her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
(Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie, Kids?)
No but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest!
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail



[Bridge: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called Hi! My Name Is dropped
Started thinking my name was Fault
Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent
Of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
Gangster? Nah, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I went against it
It was ingrained in me
That I wouldn't amount to a shit stain, I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
"Do I really belong in this game?", I pondered
I just wanna play my part
Should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful
Or disrespect the art form I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face
Before you get made pissed off
And keep plugging, it's your only outlet
And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion 80 times
How many times can I say the same thing
Different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story, bet you feel the same way I felt
When I was in the same place you are, when I was afraid to

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I was a afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

[Chorus: Sia]
Guts over fear, the time is near
Guts over fear, might shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear

[Bridge: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I know what it was like, I was there once
Single parents, hate your appearance
As you struggle to find your place in this world
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song
Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
Started to spit harder shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
And the lights go out in that trailer park
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows and I'm frozen
Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
So, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song
But I rather make Not Afraid 2
Than make another motherfucking We Made You, ah
Now, I don't wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just open enough eyes later on
And gave you the supplies and the tools
To hopefully use that'll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt
Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells, I was made to walk
But thank you, Ma, cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium
Least I made it out of that house
And found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did
Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar
You are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say
Don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of saltand eat their fucking faces off!
The legend of the angry blond
Lives on through you when Im gone, and to think I was a

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I was a afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

[Chorus: Sia]
Guts over fear, the time is near
Guts over fear, might shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear







[Intro]
Da-da, da-da
Yo, I can't sing, but
I feel like singing
I wanna fuckin' sing
Cause I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out

[Verse 1]
Some days I sit starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh, so crazy
Why am I here? Am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no

[Chorus 1]
Cause sometimes (Fuck) it feels like (I was scared) the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

[Verse 2]
My baby girl keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't faze me, inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no

[Chorus 1]
Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

[Verse 3]
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't *reh tnaw*
Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his momma
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world and I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe, the only lady that I adore
Hailie! So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted, and

[Chorus 2]
Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

[Outro]
Wooo! Told you I can't sing
Oh, wellI tried
Hailie, 'member when I said
If you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there?
Guess whatDaddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere, baby
I love you (*smooch*)



[Intro: Eminem]
Makaveli rest in peace
Irv Gotti, too much Bacardi in his body
Mouth like a 12-gauge shotty (Feel me!) (Come get me)
And Ja said he shall be (Motherfuckers if you want Shady)
The lost forgotten seed of 2Pac (If Pac was still here now)
To lead this industry into the ways of the man (He would never ride with Ja)
Follow me! (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Keep my mesh vest as Pac's vest

[Hook: Eminem]
Come get me
If you muthafuckas want Shady
If Pac was still here now
He would never ride with Ja
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You ain't no killa, you a pussy
That Ecstasy done got you all emotional and mushy
Bitches wearin' rags in photos, Ja's words bein' quoted
In The Source, stealin' Pac's shit like he just wrote it
You loud mouths pray to God, hopin' no one's listenin'
See 50 comin' for me, oh my god, mamy position
No one'll pay attention to me
Please Gotti, here I go, give me this pill
Ecstasy done got me feelin' so invincible
And now all of a sudden I'm a fuckin' madman who screams
Like I'm Pac, but I'm not, enemies, Hennessey
Actin' like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm crazy
Sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train
Some say my brain is all corrupted, fucked from this shit
I'm stuck, I'm addicted to these drugs, I'ma quit
Sayin' muthafuckas names before somebody fucks me up
Ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you in hell, fucka

[Hook: Eminem]
Come get me
Motherfucker if you want Shady
If Pac was still here now
He would never ride with Ja
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Hook 2: Eminem]
Get off that E
'Fore you try to come and fuck with me
It's Aftermath here now
Shady Records got it locked
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-locked

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers
Never realized the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, my bitches bring me product by the bundles
Hustle hard from a cell, G-Unit muthafucka, we ballin'
Catch me countin' cheese and when I'm callin', can you accept my call
CEO let me sip on Hennessey, can I sip some more
Hell, I done been to jail, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it
Muthafuckas thinkin' they can stop 50, they losin' it
Lil' nigga named Ja think he live like me
Talkin' 'bout he left the hospital, took 9 like me
You live in fantasies, nigga, I reject your deposit
When your lil' sweet ass gon' come out of the closet?
Now he wonderin' why DMX blowed him out
Next time grown folks talkin', bitch, close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real niggas ball to let these bitch niggas beat me
Black, you's a muthafuckin' punk and you can see me with gloves
Quit scarin' them fuckin' kids with your ugly ass mug (Ha-ha-ha)
And you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's goin' on
Nigga payback, Tah, I know your bitch ass from way back
Witnessed me strapped with Macs, you know I dont play that
All these old rappers tryin' to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man (Ha-ha)
Irv lookin' like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Tryna play hate on my shit, man, eat a fat dick
Lovin' this shit that's how you made me
Feelin' like I got you niggas crazy (Uh-uh)
Against all odds, hopin' my thug muthafuckas know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blow
To the truest shit I ever spoke
21 gun salute
Bitch!

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
I've been one of the most humble, rep the streets to the core
Hey Jeffrey, what the fuck you come involvin' me for
It's been a long time comin', like a bless and a check
You see 106 and Park fans don't even fuckin' respect you
It's kinda funny, wannabe Pac, wanna fake like you thug
Runnin' around talkin' shit that he ain't capable of
Now let me off this cocksucker whilst we handle you, nigga
If I recall, Violator use to manage you, nigga
Then took a closer look and realized you was an imposter
There's never been a Violator on a Murda Inc. roster
Dumbass, now who's shootin'? Ah made you look
You said Bus singin' the same old hook, you stupid
If y'all shootin', I take a look at your man
The bitch shot himself in front of Def Jam
Cheddar Bob ass nigga, start adjustin' your plan
You let the streets down nigga, 'pologize to your fans
Watch you pull a little stunt like we ain't know what it was
Little faggot desperate tryin' to re-establish a buzz
I know the shit is drivin' you crazy, you wonderin' how
The streets ain't never want you Beatrice, what you gonna do now?
Now if you wanna beef with me, then I'm beefin' with you
I think about the game and what it's like and what would it be without you
I'm finished, I ain't tryin' to repeat this
Just cause I'm cool, you shouldn't take my kindness for weakness

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Oh shit, it was fun
Next time you got a problem with me
Address me before you try to make shit a public issue, homie
Now I'ma return back to my regular self
And have fun again
One

[50 Cent]
Hahaha, BITCH! Haha
OUTLAWZ, haha
Makaveli the don, haha
Since you want to be 2Pac, motherfucker, hahaha
2Pac shoes too big for you to walk in you lil' faggot, hahaha

(What do we have here now?)



It's like this and like that and like this
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin' corners
Lookin' for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin' James Todd Senior
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mind state
Since the third time that I failed ninth grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person
Don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend can jump off of a bridge
And if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowin' mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now

[Intro: Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
"Cleanin' Out My Closet" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's 15 degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, "Little prick, just leave!"
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat!
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (Nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though
Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Momma, for "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a
Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, cause you're my mom

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Bridge: Nate Ruess & Eminem]
I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (Yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life



[Intro: John C. Reilly]
Wanna take it from the top?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Lady, you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit
'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two ass-cheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you could set a glass on it, it's massive
From the first time I saw you, I actually
Said to myself: "I gotta meet her" like a taxi
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic
But I'm stiff as a statue you sat on a shelf
I feel like I'ma bust, maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, slow your Camaro
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the (Meow!), hope it's not a problem, in fact
About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that
So when I put this palm on your cat
Don't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed
Why you think they call it a snatch?
I just wanna climb in the sack
I'ma keep it a hundred like my speedometer's at
I'm watchin' you rap, I'm the dude followin' back
About six cars, I'm in the 'lac, and I wanna fack

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it

[Chorus: Mark Wahlberg (& John C. Reilly)]
All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
But them jeans you wore are like I've never seen before
I pretend I work there while I clean the floor
Checkin' you out like the clerk while he rings you up
Pull out behind you when you're leavin'
And you don't even know it (word, yo Rick, man!)
She's brushin' her hair, adjustin' her mirror
She's rappin' my shit, but she wasn't aware
I was there, or maybe she was and just didn't care
Who knows? At least that ain't up in the air for some to see
So like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink
If she ain't plannin' to do shit this summer's eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But fuck the Pep Le Pew shit!
"Ain't steppin' to you, bitch," I say to myself
Plus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail like a skunk in heat
I could sweat her to some degree
But fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me
(Could you repeat that again?)
"Letter" come to me"mail." "Sweater", "heat," "some degree."  Fail
Fuck it, pull up beside her
Sideswipe her Dodge Viper, wood is so bright
I ask does she want a computer lodged in her vagina
Said my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her
I said

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it

[Chorus: Mark Wahlberg (& John C. Reilly)]
All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
Motherfuckin' gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat, so that hole musta been dug
'Cause it just died like food coloring (duh!)
So let's get turnt like a shish kabab
Twist it, ma, like an air-conditioning knob
We'd be great together
Don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never
You felt my heat rubbin' off on ya
I love your personality, come on, little mama
You're hot enough to melt Rick's beat, come jump in the water
I bet you get your self-esteem from your persona
With an ass to match, girl, your
Body is lit, you're striking, I'm a gas, girl, you're
Just gonna have to put them other chumps on the back burner
You got buns, I got Asperger's
Just let me rest my head between that set of D's
While I shred MC's like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so toolook at my pedigree! (Roof!)
Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
I'm just kiddin', girl, I wouldn't lift a finger, too
Unless it's the middle one to finger you

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it

[Chorus: Mark Wahlberg & John C. Reilly]
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

[Outro: Eminem & Mark Wahlberg]
On the ones and twos, to three or four in the mornin'
Rick's on the cut like Neosporin (Girls!)
He's mixin' it up for me, and you're in
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand
I wanna fuck, it's my big dick
So everybody get ready fucking now!



[Intro: Announcer from Soul Calibur]
Welcome back to the stage of history

(Yo, Slim Shady!)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo, I'll fuckin', I'll... I'll puke, eat it, and freak you
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to, The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
You'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't no fucking G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin' to shoot you, I'm tryin' to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin' mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers
Fuck the planet 'til it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showing up to your open casket
To fill it full of explosive gasses and close it back
With a lit match in it while I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments, laugh, roll you, and smoke the ashes

[Hook: J-Black]
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

[Verse 2: J-Black]
Am I the worst because I never go to church?
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'ma drink till my liver rot, see the doc leave the E.R
Then hit a bar for a liquor shot; fuck the liver spot!
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'ma be so high
That I'ma get up and walk, leaving the concrete bare
With the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain, but it's just to rock
Now if I pray every night
Do I still have to hold my tre very tight?
You feel me, God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearing a North Face
Nickle 9 at my waist, God done lost faith
Angels greet me, but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?

[Hook: J-Black]
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

[Interlude: Announcer]
Maxi was seriously wounded
But the soul still burns
Final battle, fight!

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch, and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill, like using the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare, cause you fucking with some niggas like this who just don't care

[Hook: J-Black]
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

[Outro: Announcer]
Time's up! You lose!

Gotham!



[Verse 1: Eminem]
I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch, I want the fans jumping
I want the fists pumping in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't ya fill your cups?
Shady's come to feel ya up, are you a D or a C cup?
You could even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the ER, we are strapped with so much TNT
We may blow, no, not even CPR from the EMTs
Could help you to resuscitate, you busters must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard
What's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
(Chkk-chk-chk) What's my name?
Shady came and just crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them
'Cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear his skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'Cause this shit's getting embarrassin'
The fog is thick and the air is thin
'Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
La-dididi-dadada-didi
He makes it look so easy, girl, you just hit the lottery

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
This is when shit hits the fan like it just splattered on Stan
This is the only moment that matters
Your homie rolled in with Mathers
Now chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say at once, this songs like a seance, it haunts
It makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off of what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smoking something
You think I ain't smoking nothing, stay off my nuts
Now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose
Loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah, girl, shake that caboose
I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose
A mongoose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose
Me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves
And we came here to retract the roof
Yeah, man, ain't that the truth
Girl, your man's back in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch
And this is when all hell breaks loose

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now I know you're feeling discouraged
But, homie, just mark my words
I'm murderin' the flow, liquid courage, I'm fin' to blow
As soon as we hit the door, power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit' your ho
With speakers knocking, it's 3 o'clock
Me and Doc then proceed to drop E
And hop out the vehicle and knock on your door

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out you
Revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it, freak, move to the beat
Lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there?
That'd be pretty damn stupid to me
Born and raised in the CPT, yeah, Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Them haters hatin' on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat
Dre fall off? That's news to me

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose



[Intro]
Hello
Allow me to introduce myself
My name is Shady
It's so nice to meet you
It's been a long time
I'm sorry I've been away so long
My name is Shady
I never meant to leave you, yeah

[Verse 1]
You see that chick in the gym, checking me out?
Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I'm recklessly wreckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?
There's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man, I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oh, jackpot, yeah, open sesame mouth
Down the hatch, and the feeling you can't match it
I rat-tat-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
Attack-tack-tacking a whore with a damn hatchet
A knapsack packed with like forty-some Xanaxes
Shorty come back, I'm tryna score me some lap dances
I'm 'bout to relapse, so baby pour me some Jack Daniel's
Formula 44D and 40's with bad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch, I'm back at ya

[Chorus]
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
And are you menstruating, baby?
My little friend's waiting to say hello
The way your titties are wigglin'
And your booty's shakin' like jello
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello, yeah

[Verse 2]
My equilibrium's off, must be the lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man, people give me 'em
It just becomes everyday, extra-curriculum
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun
A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
Fifty-one people asleep in my damn living room
Excuse me, hun, but what is your name, Vivian?
I woke up next to you naked, and uh, did we, um?
Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy, hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one
No offense baby girl, I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the package and I'm cool, I immediately run
Like Speedy Gon-zales to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of 3's, I'm fiending for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum

[Chorus]
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
And do you happen to have anything on you
To make my mood mellow?
Some are oval and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello

[Verse 3]
Oh, those were the days, they certainly were
It's hurting me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good
Word-word, chk-word-word, chk-word, chk-chk-word
I second that and I third, rushed to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
He's no longer getting them free, hundred bucks for these Percodans
Plus it's getting to be where he lustfully search the den
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurtin' him
Tirelessly on the phone trying to rustle up
Muscle relaxers for his back and a couple of Paxils
Now he's doubling backwards and he's stumbling back
Slipped and fell, hit his back, boom, heard something go crack
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just busting my own chops while I'm busting a rap
Resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it, I'm back

[Chorus]
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
And do you happen to have anything on you
To make my mood mellow?
Some are oval and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello

[Outro]
And so I'm saying, hello
Allow me to introduce myself
My name is Shady
It's so nice to meet you
It's been a long time
I'm sorry I've been away so long
My name is Shady
I never meant to leave you
Yeah, it's like starting over
Clean slate, hah



[Intro: Pat Benatar (Sampled)]
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!

[Hook: Pat Benatar (Sampled)]
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Proof died, what happened? (What happened?)
Marshall stopped rapping (Damn!)
I guess that makes me the captain (Uh-huh)
Hit the matress (Okay)
Pistol-packing (Uh-huh), sick assassin (Yeah)
Hit the gas and (Okay), get to mashing
D12 broke up? Who you bitches asking?
Our clique's relaxing in the hills of Aspen
Popping pills and Aspirin
And I'm the machine that brought Marshall back to life
Told him that my rhymes just have to be tight
So I figured that I would grab the mic
Like a nigga bout to rhyme right after Christ
Sometimes we get mad and fight, right back to the lab tonight
Grab an o and I have to light
That's only right, living like a rock star is the only life!
And we are, six grown men, who are old friends
To my nigga Bugz, DeShaun Holton
All the way down, I'mma hold them
D12 nigga, till the world end (D12!)

[Hook: Pat Benatar (Sampled)]
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!

[Verse 2: Swifty]
A lot of niggas try to underestimate me
Till I come back with vengeance and slice their trachea
Y'all been placed on a contract for hating
I'mma waste them, one by one, for tainting
My ability to kill a facility, I'mma send them to Satan
Fast as a child rapist facing
Life or trifle, Henny has made me in waiting
They gon' lock me up under the basement
I'm a one man army, marine and navy
You done made me angry, I'm crazy, insane
And maybe I bite the face off your baby
For anyone who try to diss Proof or Hailie
I'mma break their Halo
Put them on the reaper's payroll
Erase them and hang their soul
It ain't no hoes here, McVay got a scroll
With names on it, dipped in blood, man I'm cold

[Hook: Pat Benatar (Sampled)]
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
I know you thought we were done, we rose up
Got a gun to make your whole inside fold up
They hit us with the best shot and we're still standing
So tell the world it can lick our scrotum
Straight soldiers, who wanna stunt?
Who wanna be the fall guy? Who want the pump?
Who wanna get slumped just for looking at me sideways
Every time I roll up I'mma keep it blunt
Where did y'all run when we almost lost Marshall?
Y'all did it big like Costco
And we back in this bitch like a tampon
Still talk dirty, Em's clean like a bar of soap
And you will soon slip, on some buffoon shit
My hand's on a sweeper, yours on a broomstick
So stop looking all stupid, I'm rude and abusive
And strapped, don't make me use it

[Hook: Pat Benatar (Sampled)]
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Aight, here's where I come in at
I came in this game with, bad intentions
And I ain't budged, not even an inch since then
I'm stubborn, evil, and insensitive
I'm like nothing you ever seen, pencil in
Hand, it's like I'm holding the insulin
So you might wanna button it like Benjamin
I ain't frightened of nothing, I injure men
Step right in this mark with my henchmen and
Walk, straight to the stage
I ain't here to cause trouble, get the fuck out my face
Fall back, little cocksucker
I ain't A&W, don't get your cold mugs in my way
Get 'em? Shattered, fucking A
Been this way since B.C., what can I say?
I'm stuck in my ways like double stick tape
Don't get turned to a vegetable dick face
You ain't Superman, stay in your lane, Lois
D12 spitting flames like flamethrowers
Spit 'til we get sprained jaws with metaphors
That cut with the same force as chainsaws
Hope you're coming with your A game
Cause things have changed in this game
Isn't the same game, boys
The stakes have been raised, better make lemonade
When they give you lemons, if they want us, let 'em aim for us

[Hook: Pat Benatar (Sampled)]
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!

[Intro]
"Life," by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it
It's gonna come back around to tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies with secret identities
And disguises to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearin' that they was always down
What is life? I'm tired of life

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of backstabbin'-ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committin' so many sins
Tired of always givin' in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never havin' any ends
Tired of havin' skinny friends, hooked on crack and Mini Thins
I'm tired of this DJ playin' your shit when he spins
Tired of not havin' a deal
Tired of havin' to deal with the bullshit without grabbin' the steel
Tired of drownin' in my sorrow
Tired of havin' to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off
At $5.50 an hour, then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of bein' fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of havin' to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk, breathin' down my neck, drivin' me berserk
I'm tired of usin' plastic silverware
Tired of workin' at Builder's Square
Tired of not bein' a millionaire

[Chorus]
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on
While I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough
Because I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks
If I had one wish, I would ask
For a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of bein' white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of takin' pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not havin' a phone
Tired of not havin' a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not drivin' a BM
Tired of not workin' at GM, tired of wantin' to be him
Tired of not sleepin' without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performin' in a packed coliseum
Tired of not bein' on tour
Tired of fuckin' the same blonde whore
After work, in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of fakin' knots with a stack of ones
Havin' a lack of funds and resortin' back to guns
Tired of bein' stared at
Tired of wearin' the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of steppin' in clubs, wearin' the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people sayin' they're tired of hearin' me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Sayin' they wasn't feelin' me on "Nobody's As Ill As Me"
And I'm tired of radio stations tellin' fibs
Tired of JLB sayin', "Where hip-hop lives"

[Chorus]
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on
While I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough
Because I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks
If I had one wish, I would ask
For a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit, tellin' me to be positive
How am I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
You know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
You know what I'm sayin'?
Right now, I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hatin' that's goin' on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm just fed up, that's my word

The taste of his hairy fat dick

[Verse 1: Eminem and Masta Ace]
(Ken Kaniff Voice)
Peace!
I am the man
But I'm not the one with the can in his hand
I'm down with a different kind of street band
And I appear from place to place as the Music Man aka Masta Ace



[Future]
Well Jimmy moved in with his mother
Cuz he ain't got no place to go

[Jimmy]
And now I'm right back in the gutter
With a garbage bag that's full of clothes

[Future]
Cuz you live at home in a trailer
What the hell you gonna do?

[Jimmy]
Cuz I live at home in a trailer
Mom I'm coming home to you

Well my names Jimmy, and his name's Greg Buel
And me him and you went to the same school
This ain't cool, I'm in a rage
He tapping my mom, we're almost the same age!
On the microphone I drop bombs
Look at this car, thanks a lot mom!
"Here happy birthday Rabbit
Here's a brand new car, you can have it"
A 1928 delta, this shit won't even get me to the shelter!
And I can't even say I'm from Motown
Cause I'm back in the 8-1-0 now

Cuz I live at home in a trailer
Mom I'm coming home to you



I need Christopher Reeves to come and lay his verse
I think he can spit it better on Medicine Ball
First off, I did not even realize the guy died
So I guess them Christopher Reeves jokes ain't gonna fly
Whoa, I'm on a roll, don't get me started
Ellen got pissed at me tried to push me and pussy farted
With such accuracy he aims and he shoots the target
Cupid's arrow and Portia ??? now look, sweetheart it's
The kissin' bandit on a mission to leave, Miss Degeneres
Disenchanted by men now just listen damn it
Miss De Rossi, I need no posse, now single-Hand-ed-ly
Will steal your heart with a kiss
Where should I plant it? Mm-wha! Baby, it's *moi*
And my repertoire's runnin' around in pink panties and leopard bra
And negligar, negligee, you say tomayto I say TOMato
Im Tommy Mottola Mariah don`t stop me I`m on a roll, ohh
Y'all know what it is



[Chorus]
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

[Verse 1]
I murder a rhyme, one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better get rid of that 9, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for Hell, like hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block 'til I cut a kitten's head off
And stuck it in this kid's mailbox (Hey Ma', Ma'!)
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (Yes)
Grew up quick (No) was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say's right
You think of my name now whenever you say, "Hi"
Became a commodity 'cause I'm W-H-I-
T-E, cause MTV was so friendly
To me, can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips, bitch! What, my mouth isn't workin'?
You hear this finger? Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

[Chorus]
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (Shady!)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

[Verse 2]
I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
(*Scratches*) My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational (*scratch*) "Back is the incredible!"
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the Internet
Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed
It's a sick world we live in these days
"Slim, for Pete's sakes, put down Christopher Reeve's legs!"
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
"Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it."
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic, whose eyes
Get so squinted, I'm blind from smoke in 'em, with my windows tinted
With nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em
With a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo-scented
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me

[Chorus]
They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back (Back)

[Verse 3]
I take seven {kids} from {Columbine}, stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a 9
A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
Cause I'm Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, NSYNC, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (Ahh!)
So I just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and, Puffy, you know this
I'm sorry, Puff, but I don't give a fuck
If this chick was my own mother, I'd still fuck her with no rubber
And cum inside her and have a son and a new brother at the same time
And just say that it ain't minewhat's my name?

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

[Outro]
Guess who's b-back, back
Gue-gue-guess who's back (hi, Mom!)
{*scratch*} Guess who's back
{*scratch*} Gue {*scratch*} guess who's back
D-12 {*scratch*} guess who's back
Gue, gue-gue-gue, guess who's back
Dr. Dre {*scratch*} guess who's back
Back back {*scratch*} back {*scratch*}
Slim Shady, 2001
I'm blew out from this blunt (*sighs*) fuck



[Narrator]
Torture chambers, secret passageways, vats of acid, and deadly vaults

[Intro]
I said, ohh
Damn, it feels good to be back
I'm having a Relapse

[Eminem]
How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges?
He's already got life in jail man, what the hell is his problem?
Well to be honest, the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic
They've compelled me to kill this elderly man
And I get these panic attacks, pop a Xanax, relax
Trying to stick my fucking dick inside a mannequin's ass
Then I get manic depressed, see the orthodontist, get gassed
Man, it's kick ass, the first thing I put on is the mask
Speaking of masks, man, it ain't too late to have a change of pace
And take it off and show my face, so you can see the things you face
And slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by strangulation
That's bacon souffle you making, ain't you? Well, thank you, Jason
There goes one more coma, due to blunt force trauma
Just give me one more Soma and I'll be done for mama
Go in the damn broom closet, another Valium, lost it
Shoving the vacuum nozzle, down the bathroom faucet
It seems like everyday I get a little flakier
The medication is making my hands a little shakier
Hand me that eighteen-month-old baby to shake him up
It'll only take me a second to choke his trachea
Breaking his neck in eighty-some places baby, here Shady comes, lady
He's got the razor b-blades and the ch-ch-chainsa-saw, baby
You b-b-blundering, bumbling, m-m-mumbling dum-dums
Yeah, here I come-come, you hear the rumbling vrumm-vrumm?
There's something inside of that blue tub and that drum, drum
A head and torso of someone, where'd it come from?
Who's it belong to? Maybe the girl with the long, blonde
Hair who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom-poms
Clearly there's somethin' wrong, cause she didn't come home
She's missing, where is she? Something fishy is going on
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs
Now everybody get your dance on to my damn song, come on

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough? (Huh?)
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl? (I did)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes, and still screamed "Fuck the world"
(I'm Slim Shady) So come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me 25 times in the same spot (Ow)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot
Stop they blood flow 'til they veins clot
I need a pain shot and a shot of plain Scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you

[Chorus]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (Uh-huh)
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like
'Cause this is how I am in real life (Mhm)
I don't want to just die a normal death
I wanna be killed twice (Uh-huh)
I just wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
'Cause your wife said this the biggest knife
She ever saw in her life (Help me, help me)
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
(Stay in school)
Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck-you letter

[Chorus]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yo, I'll listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
(Ahh, that shit is wack)
Six months later, you'll hear your lyrics on my shit
(That's my shit)
People don't buy shit no more, they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number-one club hit
(Yup, uh-huh)
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (Uh-huh)
And if I told you I had AIDS, y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid mothafuckas think I'm playin' when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed (Uh-huh)
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (Yup)
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and bitching
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS-infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested

[Chorus]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

[Outro]
I told you I was Shady (Yup)
Y'all didn't wanna believe me (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
I'm Shady
And that's my name

Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough? (huh?)
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl? (I did!)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed, "Fuck the world!"
(Slim Shady...) so come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me twenty-five times in the same spot (Ow!)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot til they brains rot (uhh-oh)
Stop they blood flow until they veins clot
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop (gulp gulp)
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make em fear you 'fore you make em feel you

[Intro]
Aw, yeah (It's like this, like this)
It's Eminem, baby
Back up in that motherfuckin' ass
('Til forever, 'til forever)
One time for your motherfuckin' mind (For MC's, MC's)
We represent the 313you know what Im sayin'?
Yo, they dont know shit about this, for the '96

[Verse 1]
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action
A brainiac in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
I travel through your mind and to your spine like siren drills
I'm slimin' grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects
And twistin' necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue
Turn your system up, twist 'em up
And indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more car-tunes than animation
My lamination of nar-er-ration, hits a snare and bass
On a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be starin' gazin'
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland; I'm Infinite

[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

[Verse 2]
Bust it, I let the beat commence
So I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince
A crew to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral
Is deeper than a jeep-full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's, and stand the lonely one
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator
Simulator of data, eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
My a cappella releases classic masterpieces
Through telekinesis, it eases you mentally
Gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

[Verse 3]
Man, I got evidence, I'm never dense
And I've been clever ever since my residence was hesitant
To do some shit that represents the MO
So I'm assumin' all responsibility
Cause there's a monster real in me
That always wants to kill emcees
Mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric-smugglin' embezzler
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool
Then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact, I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
On my last jam, plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit, and tempted
When I see the sins my friends commit; I'm Infinite

[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it

[Verse 1]
I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah, fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
"We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed"
Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
"After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest," the next day my mother said
"I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom, he's dead"
"Debbie, don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck
I'll bet you he's fakin' it, I'll bet you, I bet
He probably just wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this, of course unless you object"
"Aw, go fuck his brains out if any's left in his head"

[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

[Verse 2]
"Did you get him?" Naw, fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding-dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yeah, maniac, that's Shady, dawg
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dawg?
Shady, dawg, what be goin' through that fuckin' brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for? Sing along

[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

[Verse 3]
Don't you know what felch means? ("Yeah") Well then, tell me
Would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck 'em in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp, belch, and go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm saying, man? Can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my stepfather felt me (Oh...)
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping
"Shady, what the fuck you saying?" I don't know, help me!
What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fuckin' melting
"Marshall, I just love you, boy, I care about your well-being"
No, Dad, I said no  I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself, see?
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it "Pubic Hair on Chelsea"
"Well, this is called 'Ass Rape' and we're shooting the jail scene"

[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane



[Verse 1]
I'm like a white Michael Vick, psycho enough to stick
Michael J. Fox in a microwavewitha Rott (Ell-ell-elle)
Imight make a little Aliz witha side of NyQuil
And ride a motorcycle right through the side of my high school
Satan's disciple with a sniper rifle
And a knife and a white diaper
Liable to shit on you while I snipe you
So dope he gets off opiates
What an appropriate way to start off his day
He may just smart off to Dre
He may be hard to contain
Cause his rage is so hard to gauge
See, Hannibal ate his face, and met Jason, gnawed off his leg
Amazin' hard-on for razors and blades
And anything sharp, even poisonous darts
It all plays a major part of his game
Holy water won't ward him off, crucifixes won't do the trick
He's so sick, it's ridiculous
Sawed the crazy part off his brain, he's still insane
Why's there bloodstains on his carpet, mane?
There's some crazy shit goin' on in Shady's apartment again (woosh)

[Verse 2]
Newsflash, I'm still trash
Them pills shoulda killed my ass
But they didn't; they just made me stronger
It's like they rebuilt my ass
Like the Six Million Dollar Man after the crash
It's Aftermath, bitch! And my milk glass is still half-empty
Yeah, tempt me, Hell isn't enough
They need to invent somewhere new to send me
As sick as I'm getting
They'll stick me in a conventional oven
With a rotisserie setting and won't even notice me sweating
Shit, I done made a verse, said some foul shit
Tryna go back fix it, fucked around, and just made it worse
Yeah, I'm back, looking no worse for wear
Got these haters mad enough to rip off their hair
And start punchin' the air
Fall the fuck out, spill your lunch in the chair (eww)

[Verse 3]
(Chicka) I'll do a hundred-yard dash just to slash Kim Kardash'
In the ass with a shard of glass from Nick Hogan's car crash
You may look like the passenger for that, don't be a smartass
Yeah, laugh while you sit there
Thinkin' that the hard part passed
You ain't seen pain 'til Leatherface flips mane
I'll cut your fuckin' balls off, homie, my saw's off the chain
I chopped the bitch in half with it, sawed off her legs
And the top half of the torso fuckin' crawled off insane
I ain't seen shit like that since I went to Mike Jack's
Took the Elephant Man's skull, fucked it, and put it right back
Handed my dick to Bubbles
While he sucked it and licked my nut sack
Gave him a reach-around
While I fucked him right in his butt crack
Nah, I ain't takin' it back fo.., fuck that!
I give a fuck about nothin', so here's where you fucked up at
Don't go touchin' that can
Man, you don't wanna open up that

[Outro]
Wait a min-ahh, shit Alchemist, cut that..
(Laughter, Record Scratching)



Angie:  It's Hot 97, and I got my man on the phone. You know 7 billion dollars first week in at the box office, on 8 Mile. Can we have one time please Eminem *clapping* is on the telephone.

Eminem:  Angie, Angie, Angie. *Angie laughing* What's up?

Angie:  Wh.. why the stress in your voice?

Eminem:  Wh.. why the stress?

Angie:  Yeah?

Eminem:  No distress.

Angie:  You know what I have to say to you before we talk about anything, just congratulations man 'cause..

Eminem:  Thank you Angie, you too!

Angie:  Thank you man!

Eminem:  They're banging the single out here. They're banging.

Angie:  I was in Detroit two days ago, I like it there.

Eminem:  Yeah, I told them to!

Angie:  Oh that's what it was? *Laughing*

Eminem:  I told em' to!

Angie:  I actually.. I actually used the "Lose Yourself" instrumental to come out to.. I figured you know, I was in your town, it would work, it was big for me

Eminem:  Well right, being the [?] I figured that was the right thing to do

Angie:  Yeah yeah, thank you. No man, but the 8 Mile thing just you know, just received so well and just, you know, and incredible job man, so congratulations on all that

Eminem:  Thank you I've had a beautiful time

Angie:  So how you feeling man? What's [?] some [?]

Eminem:  I'm good, success is good, everything is..

Angie:  I'm not used to this side of you

Eminem:  You're not used to this side?

Angie:  No *Laughing*, you sound very grown up

Eminem:  Um, I'm growing up a little bit, I'm trying


Angie:  Alright, talk to me man, what the hell is going on?

Eminem:  Alright, I did.. first of all, I want to make a little comment, you know, I just want to comment on this whole thing that's going on, this little, this little whatever it..

Angie:  Feud?

Eminem:  Yeah, this little feud.

Angie:  I saw it on MTV yesterday, it's official now!

Eminem:  It's crazy!

Angie:  You and Benzino..

Eminem:  First time he's ever been on TV, I want to congratulate him. The first time he's ever been on MTV and he did 106 & Park, so I want to congratulate him on that too.

Angie:  So he's getting public.

Eminem:  I'm definitely bringing a lot of success to this man, but you know what, like honestly, like this dude, I buried him already. He's speaking from the grave Angie, this dude is speaking from the grave.

Angie:  Oh would you be referring to the song on the Green Lantern Mixtape?

Eminem:  I'll be referring to, I'd be referring to the one, the new one that he has. The newest one, the.. the one with the.. the fake "Victory" beat. I think he calls it I Lost

Angie:  Oh the one Benzino did? Right right, but you then came on the, I the joint I heard came from you was on the Green Lantern Mixtape

Eminem:  Yeah see, I'm gonna tell you the story what happened

Angie:  Okay

Eminem:  He dissed me on a record, I didn't respond right, I didn't respond. Then he dissed me again, went back in the studio again. I think he was mad that I didn't respond.

Angie:  He finally..

Eminem:  Not that it didn't hit my radar 'cause this dude owns half of The Source  magazine. That's why it hit my radar, but my manager, once again, Paul Rosenberg, you know, tried to talk me out of it. "Don't respond, it's not worth it". The second time he did it I said "You know what, I'm gonna let him have it". So I gave it to him. Two songs.. two songs, to his two songs.

Angie:  Right

Eminem:  Now this next time, now I already buried him. I put the nail in the coffin, I kick the dirt on his grave.

*Eminem with muffled voice imitating the buried Benzino*

"This [?] is [?].. I'm never gonna get out! Somebody please let me out!"

Angie:  *Laughing*

Eminem:  He's done. And all the stuff that, you know, all this.. all this gangster shit that he wants to talk, mr. Tough Guy and this and that. Let me tell you something. This dude talks about killing my daughter on the record, he does not want to take it there, he does not? want to take it there. If he really wanted to take it there, and take it on a street level, like he's saying and screaming and jumping up and down in his records he would.. he would not have went back in the studio 'cause a mic can't fight you back dawg, a mic cannot fight you back. He would not have went back in the studio..

Angie:  Okay okay, would.. okay. Ca.. can I just take it back to the beginning with the first song where he came at you. Just the jump off to this whole thing..

Eminem:  It's not a song.

Angie:  A freestyle.

Eminem:  It's not even a free.. I hope to God he was freestyling 'cause if he wrote that, I really feel bad.

Angie:  Alright, let's you took, uhm, I'm talking of exhibit A. The first thing from Benzino. Di.. did you, I mean, did something happen to spark that between you and him, did anything happen, I mean..

Eminem:  Angie, i swear on my daughter's life, I never met this dude, I never met this man, this girl in my life. I never met this woman, she is obsessed with me. I can.. I cannot understand it, you know what it is? I think that.. I think Angie, a lot of times being that I've been out for like, you know, the last four years or whatever, I think people are starting to forget a little bit, that I came from the bottom

Angie:  *Softly* Mhm, right

Eminem:  You know what I'm saying? I took those cards and I remember Denaun.. Kon Artist from D12 told me some deep shit the other day. He said: "Remember when we was flipping burgers at Gilbert's, and you was mad, you was always punching walls and breaking mirrors, and saying "I can't get a deal 'cause I'm white, can't get a deal, I'm white I'm white, it's 'cause I'm white, it's 'cause I'm white". And then I took the cards I was dealt in life, and I flipped them. I flipped the cards and now I'm selling so many records because I'm white, you know what I'm saying?

Angie:  Right.. Right

Eminem:  So I flip the cards I was dealt, but this dude is a fat 40 year old, shriveled up, wrinkled prune, with a big puffy.. big puffy clown hair. So take them cards you were dealt with and say that in your rap, flip them cards. You know what I'm saying? Take them cards that you're dealt. Stop being mad at me, stop concentrating on my life so much and get one on your own.

*Hot 97. com the hottest hiphop spot on the web!*

Angie:  Is it fair to say that you are, not just from Benzino, but just in general, like you're just tired of hearing people beef about that?

Eminem:  I'm sick of the excuses, that everybody making excuses, like if people must not listen to my songs, like in "White America", like I clown about it. You know what I'm saying I.., but the truth of the matter is that I flip the card Angie, I flip the card. Everybody has a set of cards you're dealt with in life, then flip them. You got to take them cards and flip them. If he doesn't have.. is smart to flip them cards, don't blame me. Don't blame me 'cause you suck. This dude, Angie, I think could very well, after hearing his last record, I truly believe, and I'm not even exaggerating, this dude, could possibly be the worst rapper in the world.

Angie:  In your opinion?

Eminem:  In a lot of people's opinion. Well I'm serious like I've never, I've never thought I would see the day where I met or heard, the whackest rapper in the world. I've heard a lot of whack rappers, but he very well, possibly could be, the worst rapper in the world, going against one of the best. And that's not to say, to toot my own horn, I.. I.. I.. never would consider myself the best, if anything.

Angie:  Do you.. do you not?

Eminem:  No.

Angie:  'Cause some people would right now consider you, right now, the best out.

Eminem:  I would not consider myself best out.

Angie:  Who is?

Eminem:  You got Jay-Z, you got Nas, you got Fifty. All of them guys, all of them cats, Redman, all of them guys, are.. are the best at what they do and, you know what I'm saying? I think a lot of times, maybe it, I don't know, maybe it bugs some people's mind a little bit, that I'm not only.. I'm not only rapping, but I'm making the beats too now. I'm making the beats, I'm doing the producing, you know what I'm saying?

Angie:  At least you're getting a lot of money, some people get tight about that man.

Eminem:  It' not even, Angie, it's not even about the money, because I have yet to charge for a track.

Angie:  Really?

Eminem:  I did a track for Jay, I didn't charge. I did a track for Nas, I did a track for Xzibit, I don't even charge for the tracks. I'm free! If I respect you as an artist, and I like your shit, I'm gonna give you a track, I'm gonna give it to you. 'Cause to me it's not about the money, it's about hip hop.

*Hot 97 - Hot 97 - Hot 97.com*


Angie:  Eminem is still on the phone, I have a million questions about the whole 50 Cent thing, but let's pick up where we left off before, just for a second.

Eminem:  Going back to what we was talking about, as far as just..

Angie:  If you just tuned in Eminem is on the phone. He's kinda talking about his side, his perspective on this whole thing that happened with Benzino and..

Eminem:  You know, I guess. They say... they say this when you.. when you hit forty, that you go through your second childhood, so I think that is what this man is going through. It's the second childhood, but I haven't got there yet.

Angie:  Did you ever speak.. Have you ever spoken to him?

Eminem:  I've never even spoke to this man, you can't speak to him, because he record conversations. I might.. what if.. what if I call this man and I threaten him over the phone

Angie:  How do you know that? How do you know that?

Eminem:  Huh?

Angie:  How do you know that?

Eminem:  Because he took a tape. He called Paul and was taping, was taping Paul the whole time, and Angie, you know Paul. Paul's not a fighter. It's Paul's job to de-escalate the situation, so he took that screaming at Paul, and put that on the beginning of his song.

Angie:  *To someone in the studio* You heard that thing?

Eminem:  Now this man is not talking to me, he's talking to my manager, it's my manager's job to de-escalate the situation. I'm on probation. Paul has seen before how I've reacted to certain things and thought he was doing the right thing, by trying to squash it. This dude trying to play dirty pool

Angie:  Wow

Eminem:  What this dude is, I think it's a mid-life crisis Angie, he's going through a mid-life crisis. He's done everything from Will Smith records, to "Rock The Party", trying to come back to the streets.

Angie:  Is he really getting under your skin? No, I mean I can't, I mean..

Eminem:  The only reason.. The only reason that I responded to this clown in the first place, is because of the extortion that is going on between him and Dave Mays. Nobody wanted to address it. Everybody in the business you talk to, any rapper in the business, and I'm not gonna put you on the blast Angie, but we all know what's going on at The Source. Ray Benzino has Dave Mays shook. And you can't play two sides of the fence, you can't be a rapper... you can't be a rapper and own a magazine... own half of a magazine. Because then what happens is, you call rappers that you like, you call them and you want them to make a guest appearance on your album, and if they don't want to do it because you suck. He's gonna  then he's gonna shut you out of his magazine, so you can't play both sides of the fence like that. You just can't do it.

Angie:  So that's what motivated you to see...

Eminem:  That's what motivated me..

Angie:  Was that something that was bothering you, before he started getting at you?

Eminem:  You know what used to bother me it's been.. it's been the mic.. the mic rating system in The Source. Like, when I was a kid growing up in the early 90's on hip hop, The Source as we used to know it, was the bible of hip hop. Like what... it was... their word was gold. If somebody got a four mics you was going to cop it. If somebody got five mics you was going to cop it. If somebody got three and a half, yeah, you know, you wouldn't know, but their word was gold and it was usually right. Now what's happened is this dude is doing the mic rating system, he even said so in his song "The five mic giver". I give the mic, I distribute the mics, but I'm a rapper too. You can't do that. He's fucking the game up and like...

Angie:   I know that you have yet to receive a five mic review in The Source. Is that something that has...

Eminem:  I have yet to receive even a four and a half. Everybody gets a four, everybody, like that's the standard now, that's the standard. If you get a four and a half that must mean that Benzino wants you on his album, you know what I'm saying? And as far as my contribution to hip hop, him calling me a culture stealer and an invader and all that stuff. As far as my contribution to hip hop. How was my contribution to hip hop any different than Dave Mays and Jonathan Shecter when they started The Source twelve-thirteen years ago, was to make hip-hop bigger and expand it. If I can take hip hop and open more white people's ears to hip hop so that artists like Nelly, and Ja Rule, and Jay-Z, and Cameron, and Ludacris and Nas can sell more records, then that's my contribution to hip hop. You know what I'm saying?

Angie:  Right

Eminem:  I'm just.. I'm only.. I'm only.. being real and I swear to you Angie, this dude can.. can.. he can scrounge up change and call you from a payphone after this interview and he can.. can scream, he can jump up and down and scream all he want, he can make... go in the studio and make a hundred thousand more records about me, and base his whole life around mine, I will not make another song about this man. He cannot afford to pay the bill when I [?] for the studio time. Then he owes me back. This dude is so whack, I can't even get D12 to do a song about him. They're screaming at me like "why are you even giving this guy the energy?" Because unfortunately I'm in a position where the more attention I pay to something, the bigger it get.

Angie:  So how you gonna... how you gonna... how you gonna not now. What if the dude just keeps making song after song after song, and every now and then he say something that get on your nerves, you just not responding anymore?

Eminem:  I'm done. Anything he does from.. from now on
*Eminem in muffled voice* "Will be like this" Speaking from the grave, I buried him, I buried him, I put the nail in the coffin, I threw the dirt on the top of his grave. I don't even think I'll put him in the coffin, I think I just buried him in a hole and threw the dirt on his grave.

Angie:  What happens if you see this dude man?

Eminem:  What happens if I see him?

Angie:  Yeah?

Eminem:  I'm on probation. I'm on probation, so I really would not like to comment on that, but I will let it be known that I got three months left of probation.

Angie:  Alright, but you don't want to jeopardize any of this..

Eminem:   No, I'm not trying to yo. I'm trying.. yo I'm trying to stay in the studio, I'm trying to release my records, make my artists big and spend time with my little girl.

*Hot 97.com Hip Hop's hottest spot on the web*

Angie:  Your song is No.1 today...

Eminem:  That's a beautiful thing.

Angie:  How do you decide who you respond to?

Eminem:   If I get 10 people coming to me on the street saying why is such & such dissin' you, if it gets to the point where I hear it everywhere I go. But this woman here, she is done... she is outta my life.

Hey yo, here's a song for the ladies...



"So let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?"
{*scratching*} What is this? What is this?

[Intro]
The Invasion! (Invasion yeah)
Green Lantern! The infiltration, we comin'! (yeah)

[Bridge: Eminem]
I got 50 Cent, I got G-Unit
D-Tweezy in this bitch, with Obie Trice!
So watch what you say, 'fore you call our name
Cause you say one more thing and it won't be nice!

[Verse: Eminem]
Whoa, here we go, I shoulda' known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit
Sooner or later you little haters
Are too jealous of us to love us
You hate it G-Unit made it and Obie's coming
D-Tweezy's coming you're sick to your stomach
50 percent of it's 50 cent
The other 50 percent of it's who's color of skin it is
But if you even considerin' taking our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't trying to get too intricate into it
I'm just trying to you give you a little hint for your own benefit
Cause then it's gonna get to the point
Where it escalates into some other shit
Then I'm a flip, then I'm a get to
"Stomping in my Air Force Ones"
But you won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or it's one
It's just gonna feel like so many feet kicking you
You'd think Nike just made these into cleats in this shoe
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussies try to push me
Thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me
Y'all tickle me pink, I think I'd just rather have P!nk tickle me
Hickory dickory dock, tickety tock tickety
A little bit of the diggedy doc diggedy
Mixed with a little bit of the Jigga-J-Jigga
Wit a small pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggedy

[Hook: Eminem]
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
Cause we gon' fuck around and kill your label
Obie, D-Tweezy, G-Unit, 50, Shady records, we the label fa' sho!
We the realest label
Dont try to act like you dont feel our label
Cause we gon' fuck around and steal your paper
Obie, D-Tweezy, G-Unit, 50, we gon' kill your fuckin' label fa' sho!

[Post-Hook: Eminem]
Shady in the place to be see
And I got what it takes to +Roc The Mic+ right!
Still watch what you say to me punk
Cause I'm off probation in less than six months {*gun cocked*}

[Outro]
Haha, Shady Records
Still Aftermath, and don't think we don't
Hear you motherfuckers talkin'!
Cause we do. We see y'all
But we just gon' sit back for a minute
While I see what the FUCK y'all do



[Intro: The Cranberries]
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm packin' up my shit, as much shit in the car as I can fit
And I'm just drivin' as far as I can get
Away from these problems 'til all of my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm startin' life again
Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin'?
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin' my whole life over
Yeah right, oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive but there's nothin' like holdin'
Your head up high when you're dead inside and I just hide, so in
Case you're wonderin' why are my insides showin'
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and those are mine, so I'm
Pickin' 'em up and stuffin' 'em back
Fuck it, I've done enough in this rap shit
Recovery brought me nothin' but back
To right where I was and perhaps
This coulda been my victory lap, if I wasn't on the verge of relapse

[Chorus: The Cranberries]
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It seems to be the reoccurring main theme
The shit I would daydream as a kid, I was eighteen
I went from an irate teenager to still raging
As an adult, amazing: back then I put anything
Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Yay me, I did it! Did what?
Hailie, baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty
Percent of what I rapped about
Maybe I shoulda did a better job at separating
Shady and entertaining from real life
But this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain
It's the craziest shit I
Ever seen, and back then it was like I ain't even
Bothered taking into consideration
You one day being older and may hear me say things
I didnt (A) mean and (B) just aint me
Okay, so ladies and gentlemen
Let's strip away everything and see the main reason that I
Feel like a lame piece of shit, I sound cranky and bitter
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things
'Cause when I look at me, I don't see what they see
I feel ashamed, greedy
And lately I've been contemplating
Escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me
It's making me crazy, what's in my

[Chorus: The Cranberries]
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh



[Intro]
Your mother.. you fuckin' faggot
Ayo, this next song is dedicated to the memory of Erik Shrody
Rest in peace, we ain't forget about you, you fuckin' homo, we still remember

[Verse 1]
There once was a man who liked to jump around
But he got too old to jump up and down
So he put the mic down and picked the guitar up
Started singin the blues like there was no tomorrow
Left his boys in the House of Pain
It was the wisest decision he ever made
But the dumbest thing he could ever do
Was try to buck a .380 on those that act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do

[Hook]
Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

[Verse 2]
I remember back when you had the Knack
And I remember when you had your first heart attack
I was right there laughin when I heard the news
I just wish the cardiac woulda murdered you
Maybe Ice-T's right, you are a bitch
You come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich
But the dumbest thing you could ever do
Was try to buck a 380 on those that act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do

[Hook]
Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

[Verse 3]
Remember back in '94, like right before Ms. Everlast was Whitey Ford
Before his heart attack had him on life support
When House of Pain was outta fame like someone doused the flame
And they became destined to never jump around again
Or even further back, when I first had heard "The Knack"
And you were down with Syndicate, I went to get your shit, man I was into it
But then you went and took your style and switched the shit
Now you sound ridiculous, you dickless piece of shit
How could you diss me, bitch?
I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude
Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you
Started rhymin, then you left the room and didn't say goodbye or nothin'?
Like you mad that someone else was white and tried to rhyme or somethin
I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin to steal your light or nothin
But you're a homosexual, white rappin Irish (Muslim)
Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a *Muslim* too
Then I'd be confused as you, and I wouldn't know what to do
What's up with you? I never fucked with you, why would you fuck with me?
Knowin' I could rap circles around you, what, are you as nuts as me?
Plus I can sing better than you and I don't fuckin' sing
And probably play guitar better, and I ain't never touched a string
But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you
I'm what you used to be, shit you was me in '92
So everytime I write a lyric, I'mma think of you
And maybe that will help me know what it's like to sing the blues

[Hook]
Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

[Outro]
You fuckin' punk pussy, you fuckin faggot, sissy fuck
And by the way, a .380's a fuckin' sissy gun
If you're gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin' real gun, you little bitch
Next time say my fuckin' name in a song, don't be subliminal about it
You wanna fuckin' diss me, diss me you fuckin' faggot
You fuckin' punk pussy, you fuckin' little bitch, fuckin' cunt



[Hook]
Thanks it's been real
I love you but I just can't deal
With the stress this game is giving me...
But before I go
You know
I can't close the show
Without no closure
So before I leave...

[Eminem talking]
Yeah
I just want to take the time out to basically say
Rest In Peace to Deshaun Holton
That's my heart man
Dr. Dre
For giving me the opportunity
Just to even listen to me
To get me to this point
I wanna thank Jimmy Iovine
Interscope, Aftermath
Everybody in the whole Shady staff
Everybody whos basically supported me from day one
Paul Rosenberg, Tracy McNew
You know I love you guys
I couldn't do it all without you
D12
Ca$his, you're gonna be a beast when you get out there man
Trust me homie, my ears don't lie to me
Who else am I forgetting
Oh yeah, Obie Trice
Bobby Creekwater, and basically man
The whole city of Detroit
8 mile road for making what I am today
Which basically goes back to Proof and D12
I love you guys man
Runyon Ave for holding me down when shit got thick
Oh, it wouldn't be complete, If I didn't
Thank my mom, bitch
Haha
So

[Hook (Fading)]
Thanks it's been real
I love you but I just can't deal
With the stress this game is giving me...
But before I go
You know
I can't close the show
Without no closure
So before I leave...



[Intro: Proof & Eminem]
Check it out!
Hey, Kyu!

[Hook: Eye-Kyu]
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here

[Verse 1: Eminem]
One day I plan to be a family man, happily married
I want to grow to be so old that I have to be carried
'Til I'm glad to be buried, and leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be plannin' this stuff
'Cause I'm still strugglin' hard to be the man, and it's tough
'Cause man, it's been rough, but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of
Damaged and scuffed, my hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff, or plan to give up
The minute shit hits the fan, it erupts
I'm antein' up, double or nothin'
I've been troubled enough and
I'm sick of strugglin' and sufferin'
See, my destiny's to rest at ease
'Til I'm impressed and pleased
With my progress I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I see the golden gates to Heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you
When you're steppin' on turf, Kyu

[Hook: Eye-Kyu]
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm goin' for broke, gamblin' and playin' for keeps
Every day in the streets, scramblin' and payin' for cheap
Prayin' for sleep, dreamin' with a waterin' mouth
Wishin' for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughterin' house
Caught up in bouts with the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make them do shit illegal for these Grants and Jacksons
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the midst of this insanity, I found my Christianity
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
Always gropin' a mess of flyin' over the nest
To sellin' dope with the rest
I quit smokin' cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool
Tryin' to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's tryin' to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, runnin' home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Takin' target practice on teens for Starter jackets
I'm usin' smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm tryin' to do well on this Earth
But it's been hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth

[Hook: Eye-Kyu]
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here



It's only fair to warn
I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella
To chop a fella to Mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in a cellar
With your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your vein feeding you liquid Darvocet
Pumping you full of drugs
Pull the plugs on the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To Receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants
And given a less than 20 percent chance of living
Have a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in Grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you
While you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired an arson to set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment



[Intro: Sample]
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!

[Woman's voice: (Talking over the singing)]
Jealous?! What he mean "jealous"?
Know what I'm sayin'? He just mad cause he all with them ugly hoes, know what I'm sayin'?
Girls don't buy him no clothes
He bought that ho some clothes!
He don't buy me no clothes
That nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick
I mean, what do I got to be jealous fo'?
He ain't gonna make it nowhere
He ain't got no type of time
He has no career move, I mean

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I come home every single day from workin' double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside and you pretend you miss me
When you kiss me, then you diss me
And we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me, for numbers, tryin' to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus we only squabble over irrelevant issues
Too many tissues for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings, you say I'm bad at timin' things
So what's a man to do
When all I hand to you is handed back to me?
You act to be this gangsta bitch
That ain't what first attracted me
I used to love your company
Now youre always pumpin' me for information
And you tell your friends you plan on dumpin' me
So I'ma wait for your evacuation
Cause every accusation
Makes me wanna smack your face in
See, I've never been so sure, and you're just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check 'em in
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in
I need my second windsay what?!

[Hook: Sample x8]
Jealo-!
Jealousy!
Jealousy!

[Woman's Voice: (Talking over singing)]
Fuck you and what you going through! Fuck Eminem!
He just mad cause I left that nigga for another man
Me and Eminem don't need nothin' but minus money
Immature, me? Nigga ain't got no dick
No swang in his thang, know what I'm sayin'?
He just mad cause I'm gettin' it all night
Jealous of me, know what I'm sayin'?
That's what I'm talkin' about
Motherfucker just tryin' to get this pussy

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet scents
Until the day I started followin' your feetprints
And tappin' in your phone conversations
Through the heat ventsit made complete sense
There's someone else you like
So I confronted you and asked you, "Who was Mike?"
And you was like, (I need a new nigga)
"Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow."
Leavin' me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so brokenhearted
I fell apart when you departed, then the jokin' started
I was an open target, you play comedian
And I became the laughing stock
But now I'm on my feet again
And so we meet again, you're actin' like an ex-wife
All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
It goes, "You didn't want me to see yo' hon
Don't want me now, take the towel, wipe your brow!"
Quit tryin' to hunt me down!
You run me down and now your tryin' to apologize
For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house, y'allfellas, sing it!

[Hook: Sample x12]
Jealo-!
Jealousy!
Jealousy!



(dialing tone)

[Eminem and (Jesse)]
*Ends off I'm Shady snippet and instrumental still plays*

Oh, my God, you sound sexy
(Oh, thank you) Aw, God...
Um, listen, I was just, I-I

I swear to God, um, listen, it says

It says you're, I don't know, a ch-a-transexual
(A shemale, uhuh) A shemale, oh my God...

You fucking slut, oh God...



[Intro: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Maaaaan! Let's go
Hey yo, Fif'!
Yeah?
Call 'em and tell 'em...
It's time to hate us again
We're back!
Haha!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be black white or albino, yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it
See, if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
You can just keep makin' them tired old threads
A little bit like The Boy Who Cried Wolf, yeah
See me, but don't dare to try no shit
'Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts, right out the sky, go bad
From out of nowhere, you might just find your career
Come to it, (Eek!) and I'm just like (Oh, yeah!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh, yeah!)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
So Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh, yeah!)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em!)
And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here!)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You jealous little fucks beg for my attention, but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back, that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit, let 'em talk shit, 'cause they talk shit
Knowin' deep down, they really just wanna squash it
'Cause no one wants to walk around, steppin' in dog shit
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let 'em, inside's like "Go get 'em"
And I'm just like "Why you're tryin' to fight momentum?"
We just keep winnin', by landslides, oh, and um
Shady Limited's, in any size yo' denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say "Our clothing line's on Fiyaa''
Meanwhile, your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I'll just keep fucking you like I fucked her
Right in the ass with K-Y, yes, sir!
So full of joy, boy, am I absurd?
Even Chingy would tell you: "Yeah, boy, don't curr"

[Chorus: Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh, yeah!)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
So Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh, yeah!)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em!)
And where is G-Unit at, they're like (We over here!)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere!)

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Your homie got clapped on, man, I don't care
The cops in my nana crib, but I'm not there
It is what it is, dawg, man life's not fair
Your friends should've known not to front 'round here
Listen, kid, where I'm from,  the wolves smell fear
They'll strip your ass of your jewels right here
Man, I'ma say this one time, now get this clear
Man, you can catch a hot one like outta nowhere
A beautiful day, without drama is rare
Your girl's a freak, man, sometimes we share
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare
You probably heard about me, I'm a shown up player
In the hood politicin', like I'm runnin' for mayor
Ridin', winin', dinin' and shinin', know what I'm sayin'?
I ain't got time for fuckin' around, and horseplayin'
I'm makin' hits, my homies takin' hits, who's stayin'

[Chorus: Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh, yeah!)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
So Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh, yeah!)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em!)
And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here!)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere!)

[Outro: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Haha, haha
Yeah!
It's the Re-Up!
Haha
God, I love it
You know you hate that laugh, don't you?
Haha, haha
Keep doin' it
Do it again
What?
The laugh
Oh, haha, haha!
I like that
Haha, haha, haha, haha
Hehehe
You don't think they're gonna think we're really crazy, right?



[Intro: Eminem]
(Remix!)
A crafty little bastard that I am, sly
Would've put the slick sick son of a bitch
Silly little rabbit, don't you know Trix are for kids?
This is what the moral of the story is
(Cheah!)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be black white or albino, yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho, but I know that

(Cashis!)

[Verse 3: Cashis]
Watch Jimmy get cracked to the floor with the rounds
Spun around and hit the ground, you the new James Brown
The king of Motown saw out for a while
You not a genius, you a joke, and they all know now
I don't brag about the way that I lived in the past
I'd spray, I'd get away up with whoopin' yo ass
From now on, don't speak up, name me your raps
Before I hop out your bushes, dressed in all black
I thought I told you, Cashis can suck you clean
Squeeze life out the beat, all you hear is me (Mwah!)
I'm a BBG, plus BGD
Bring it on anytime you wanna come see me
Stay alive little guy, you don't want it with me
And man, 50 put that money on me
King Mathers made me to blow up
Re-Up bout to crush, now you know Cashis! (Shady!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh, yeah!)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
So Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh, yeah!)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em!)

(Be nice, watch your language, ok, sir?) Oh, I'm sorry
I didn't know "bitch" was a bad word



[Produced by Jeff Bass]

[Intro: Frogg]
Woah, a-get yo' hands in the air
And get to clappin' 'em and, like, back and forth
Because a-this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O, the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of, um, er-

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit yo' style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi, Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash
Bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson (Pssh)
The proof is in the puddin', just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit yo' motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss yo' magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make yo' freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, M&M was the old initials (Bye-bye)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an afghan

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Somebody let me out this limousine (Hey, let me out)
I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school, I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, ***** the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Outro: Eminem]
(Shit, fuck everybody)
Outsiderz, Pacewon, Young Zee (Fuck the entire world)
D.U

Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss yo' magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make yo' freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, M&M was the old initials (Bye-bye)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an afghan

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Somebody let me out this limousine (Hey, let me out)
I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school, I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)



[Instrumental]







[Intro: Frogg]
Woah, uh get your hands in the air
And get to clapping 'em and, like, back and forth
Because this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of um, er

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm an M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you playas worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smoking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic
"Hi, Marshall!"
I have a disease, and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet
'Cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm coming out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You getting knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the pudding, just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman

[Hook: Eminem]
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming "Fuck the world" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlasting, I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview

[Intro: Eminem]
Down down down
Down down down
Down down down
Down okay
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop pajama time

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Come here, little kiddies! On my lap!
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean "rap" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know; who'd hear it?
Give a little "poot poot," it's okay
(*fart*) Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh, baby (ah ah) oh, baby, baby (ah ah)

[Bridge 1: Eminem]
Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way 'til Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know is
When I get there someone's gonna touch my body

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
'Scuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name, girl? What's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre (ah ah) beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh, baby (ah ah) oh, baby, baby (ah ah)

[Bridge 2: Eminem]
Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt-naked
Down the street screamin' (ah ah ah ah)
Your honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said, "Save it, boy, we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality; look, it's B. Rabbit!
"Yo, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man!"
Chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubby
I don't have any lines to go right here, so chubba Teletubby
Fellas! (what?) Fellas! (what?)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (what?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt-squeezin', it's the season
Just go (ah ah ah ah); it's so appeasin'

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh, baby (ah ah) oh, baby, baby (ah ah)

[Outro: Eminem]
Touch my body
Touch my body
Oh boy, touch my body
I mean girl, touch my body

[Eminem]
Are we supposed to shut up or talk...I'll cut your butt up and walk
Around with my ass showing all over the fuckin town

[Proof]
....Then you get done up in chalk
Yo

[Eminem]
We ready...we ready .. we ready.. we ready ?
Ready to hold it steady....Speakin of hold it steady
You can hold my nuts steady and then
I can stick my dick in you like a machette...If you're a girl
If you're a girl then you're my world...And I will kill anybody
That means... you, her or him
It doesnt matter cause I'm Eminem
And I'm Slim...I'm also slim and your future's Whim

[Proof]
Ha ha....don't stop

We get in that ass Preparation-H style
Knock more boots than that group H-Town (Booo!)
Everybody tryina tell us to wait now
You look dumb as fuck...Like Puffy in his video on that breakdown (hahaha)
Tryin to dance around
How the fuck it feel lock in hand set now
Sever your style .. Divide and Parish
Part ish...when my cart is bustin thru this
Wassup to Bizarre Kid
Targets get hit and liftoff
Here it is we bout to rip off
Lick shots...no time...we gettin dick snot
Emzy

[Eminem]
Speakin of lift off
I'm blastin off...your ass is soft...so I'm startin to jack off
Cuz I'm so horny...and your lyrics are so corny
That they bore me and I woke up too late this morning
Or too early...wait a minute there goes Shirley
The girly I fucked last year when her hair was curly
Couldn't remember it cuz I was Infinite
And I met Ken Kaniff in Connecticut
He said his predicates and pronouns and wanted to throw down
And he said I like you...and then he walked up and said Let me snake bite you
And I said hell no...kicked him with my shell toe
Gave him a elbow...Ayo Proof ...go

[Proof]
Yo it's the D to the 1 - 2
What you wanna get done to
Your chest plate...eradicate
Get your flesh ate...easily done..Here it is
Freestyle...no need to write shit...cuz when we write shit
Y'all like to buy shit...that why street light up when we write stuff
It's time to be the champions at this...it's D-12
1-2 True crew...Slim Shady and Big Proof
Knockin over igloos in Alaska when we blast ya
A massacre creator, one time for data
Darker than Vader...go anybody hot as the Equator
It's time to get down one time for those that dont know us
Girls wanna blow us like Monica....Lewinsky
Come against me

[Eminem]
Go and see I'm an invincible MC
If you dont believe it then you wanna try to convince me
That you're doper than me...which we'll hope
You would hope to be....but hopefully I will rock globaly
And nationwide...thats why my ass is wide
Thats why your ass just died on the passenger side
Like a fuckin ride...when it got shot up by a drive-by
When I drove by 5 times and gave it five tries
And still missed it
I got a fuckin' mental illness a gentle stillness
Violence...complete silence is what I need in the room while I freestyle
What I need is to do...what is need is smoke weed and brew
And......smoke brew ? You don't smoke brew
If you do I'll choke you and then I guarantee I'll out smoke you
You're crew's a joke too and I can stick my dick in a bitch and poke you

[Proof]
Stick it in there....rock with my cock on sky rock
Knock ya eye out the sock...(sock)
Get..(get) yeah we come to rock....(it)
So don't get in the way cuz we gon drop....(shit)
Now how you feel right now we bust yo..op....(tic)....(tock)
We lunatics with mics and we dont stop we come to rock
The dirty dozen is non-stop
To the top from tree tops to ewoks that pop Reeboks
And men with pre-ops
Yo now there is 3-Pac's
Master P....Thug Life and now it's 2pac
Get back to that one...here goes the rhyme that you dropped

[Eminem]
The rhyme that I dropped is stickin up IHOP
In high tops and walking around like a one-eyed Cyclops
And you can't see me....I only got one eye and I can still see you
You can even give it a dumb try...If you're a dumb guy then come try this
But I rock the microphone with my flyness
So get off my jock..get of my cock..when I sky rock ...it in sky
Rock..shit...bitch

[Proof]
Ayo...a lot of people always try to tell us...that we gonna be better or failures
But me or Slim yo you can't tell me
You try to freestyle son we gon' put these verses on your LP
Slow down with that old stuff....I heard the most of y'all is Mos Def

[Eminem]
My LP...my whole LP...tha last one was screaming help me
You couldn't melt me if you was Vanilla Ice...Yo guess what
My Nuuuuuuuuutz!!
Here I go with the lyrical miracle...spiritual spirital...you dont wanna hear it though
I rickety rock the microphone
Don't do it dont do it cuz that shit is stupid...I knew it
I take a beat and loop it...I take a beat and troop it
What the fuck did that mean...I dont know but I got phat jeans on
And I already said that but I dont know where my head's at
All I wanna do is go back to the hotel and know where my bed's at

[Proof]
Yo wheres the beds at so we can relax and catch Ease
Y'all dont want none of tha dirty Deez
From the 3-1 its for the three of thirds
One third MC yo we smoke y'all like herbs
Under the curb early morn take it to born
Y'all get broke up...put back together ...re-enactment
Some times you see this...you just a faggot
No need to tag it...wit more loot that Jimmy Swagart

[Eminem]
Faggot....uh oh...was that homophobic...?
But no one knows it...and I'm so homophobic
I won't even throw clothes in the closet
Fuck it...I've lost it....I'm holocausted...see my face it's written all
Acrossed it
This beer makes me wanna disappear this year
I'm so high I'm 'bout to die...and I'm so tired I'm 'bout to fry
You're so fired you're down

[Proof]
Hey....it's me...it's the hamster man
Coming all the way from Amsterdam
And I come to tell you all a little secret
So you can ........eat it ....you got to grab your crackers
{mumbling}

[Eminem]
Quit spittin your writ shit bitch I'll kill you and kick you
In your motherfuckin' dick and your clit...you little pussy
Hermaphrodite with no appetite
And you ain't rappin' right but you was taking rapid bites
Of my dick when you was on it...my brain is haunted
I walk up in a place in a T-shirt wit my stains on it
But I dont give a damn...give a fuck...give a shit...give a hell
Give a piss give a dick give a lick

[Proof]
Yea....live and direct it's us
You better back up

[Eminem]
You better back up before I jack off
Back off before I jack off

[Proof]
You better back off before he jack off (laughing)
You better back off before I jack off

[Eminem]
Colder than Jack Frost...smack you across your face
While I'm still jackin off
Sittin' in the closet beatin' my shit
Ain't got nuttin' else to do cuz I'm thinkin' of a bitch
Wait a minute ...oh shit she's here
Look who walked in the door....come in it's Britney Spears!!!!
(Ken Kaniff)
Oh....come here little girl
Come here little girl

[Eminem]
What happened? (I dunno)
We stopped rappin' (Oh it's clappin')
Gun clappin' ...and all I need is one napkin to wipe the cum off
When I come off with the drum off
Whatever the hell that meant...but I can still speak wit' a accent
A French accent
Excuse my French but
Suck my dick touche le le poo...uhh....bitch

[Proof]
Bonjour...I'm here with the cure...Oh yea lets rock it for the drawer
Hey Em...how you doin this is me...The Em jock...get off my
Damn cock

[Eminem]
Yo while you're spraying verbs...you ain't even fuckin' saying words
(THuuuG) Pronounce your words right...and you can ride around curbs
And bounce your herbs tight
What the fuck ? (Yo somethin' is in the beat that keeps talkin')
Yo put another beat on before you get peed on

[Proof]
Yo are we done or what? They want us to freestyle for 45 min

[Eminem]
Hi...Hi.... My name is ...my name is...my name is
Slim Shady...Slim Shady...Bitch you're little just like that Kim lady
And I'm in sky rock radio...the shadiest bro on the radio
But you dont hear me though



[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Intro]
Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin'
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

[Verse 1]
Come on Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada musta runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kinda late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it! (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (yeah!)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch  it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

[Hook]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Verse 2]
See, honey, there's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
She was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on timeout
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out!
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde: me and my daughter

[Hook]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Verse 3]
Wake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin' in her ear  (Mama!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (yea)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free  whee! (woosh!)
There goes Mama, spwashin' in the water
No more fightin' with Dad, no more restrainin' order
No more stepdada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you wuv her (Mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk

[Hook]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Outro]
Just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your dada will always be there for you
Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
If you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ask
Dada will be right there
Your dada loves you  I love you, baby



[Intro]
(Fack) Okay, (Fack) how do I say this? (Fack)
Last year (Fack) didn't work out so well for me (Fack)
(Fack last year!) (Fack) (Last year can eat a dick!)
2018, (Fack) well (Fack)

[Verse 1]
Hah, yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bed sheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
Y-You collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps
O-Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
And ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it (Wrote it) (Yeah)
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it (On it) (Yeah)
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to

[Chorus]
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

[Verse 2]
I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (Wasn't)
From the moment I heard rappers cussin', I was in (Was in)
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt
Ice cold like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (Ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's lettin' up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to

[Chorus]
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all should've let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

[Bridge]
Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kami, kami-kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze (kamikaze)
Take a look at what I've done

[Verse 3]
I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that
Wait, that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it
The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift, beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is
Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin' here is a footoh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick (What?), 12 inches of wood (Haha)
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
And I've come to pay respects
'Cause if you sleep you're fuckedother words
You get laid to rest and I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot



[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm keepin' it raw, illegal like Malik and Jamal
Cause I don't believe in the law, like I'm Steven Seagal
Flippin' off the police while I'm leapin' a wall
Take some Tylenol, then fall asleep in a mall
I got ya little son, you'll be receivin' a call
You lucky this little punks still breathin' at all
Fuck the world, this how I get even at y'all
Pop shit, get rolled up and leave in a ball
I hit you in your mouth and sink ya teeth in ya jaws
You won't be able to eat shit, not even a malt
This lethal assault, is givin' you a reason to stall
I'm cockin' this deuce deuce and I'm squeezin' it off
At the first burp, fart sniffle a sneeze and a cough
Get your arm chewed off like you was teasin' a dog
I'm cold enough and hot enough to freeze and unthaw
I'll kick my girl out, in 10 degrees in her bra
You faggots turn yellow like the trees in the fall
I'm shittin' on rappers, (Where's Shady?) he's in the stall
All that's left of your niece is a piece of her doll
And all that's left of her puppy is a leash and a paw



[Ken Kaniff, (Operator), & Eminem]
I'm gonna call this motherfucker
Oh, fuck yeah
Give him a piece of my mind, a piece of my ass
(Thank you for waiting, hello, may I help you?)
Oh, thank you, I need to make a collect call
(What number?)
Oh, the number is **6-2***
(At the tone, please say your name)
Kenneth Kaniff from Connecticut, automated piece of shit
Yo
Hey there, cock boy
Who's this?
This is Ken Kaniff
Who?
Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, you little bitch
From Connecticut?
Yeah, you wanna get a-
I don't know nobody in Connecticut
You wanna get a hotel room with me?
A hotel room?
Yeah, you want me to lick your ass, Eminem?
Yo, who is this, Cage?
Hey, you want me to fuckin' melt in your mouth and not in your hand?
Melt in your ass, you little cock boy
Yo, shut up, you lil bitch
Oh, you think I'm lyin', huh?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha



Ken Kaniff: Uhh yeah, uhh suck it
Oh fuck yeah, oh Shaggy
Uhh, this is why they call you '2 Dope', ain't it?
Uhh, fuck yeah
Uhh, take it out, take it out
Uhh, now give something to Jay
Uhh, Violent Jay
Don't bite it, don't be violent with it
Ow, just suck it, nice and slow, yeah
Uhh, uhh, fuck yeah
You got.. uhh, now give it back to Shaggy
He was sucking it better
Uhh, now say my name
Shaggy 2 Dope: Eminem!
Ken Kaniff: Say my name
Shaggy 2 Dope: Eminem!
Ken Kaniff: What? Oh, fuck you guys!
Give me my dick back!
Fuck you guys!
Shaggy 2 Dope: Ken!
Ken Kaniff: If you want Eminem, you can have Eminem!
Fuck you guys, Imma leaving!
Shaggy 2 Dope: No! Ken wait! (door slams) Oh, damn!
Violent J: Nice going, Shaggy!



[Intro: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
"I've always looked at battle rap as competition or war, and the main objective is to destroy, completely fuckin obliterate your opponent by saying anything and everything, whatever the fuck you can, to get a reaction from the crowd. So nothing's off limits."
I need you to spit that lyrical miracle in the swimming pool

[Verse 1]
Before this kicks off, let me set my balls in this tees
'Cause Im dottin' i's every time I cross one of these
There's not a redeeming quality at all in me
It's impossible, seems like an implausible dream
Positive clean thoughts intervene
But they're all either altered and mean
Assault and demean, tossed and they're being lost in the scheme
Squashed in between a brainwashing machine
Like an Islamic regime, a jihadist extreme radical
Suicide bomber that's seeing
Ariana Grande sing her last song of the evening
And as the audience from the damn concert is leaving
Detonates the device strapped to his abdominal region
Im not gonna finish that, for obvious reasons
But bring your dogs, Ima muzzle 'em
Im not Middle Eastern but I'll make a bitch rock a hijab
And at least a extra large in a T-shirt
Headscarf and a piece of tarp underneath the carpet, hasta la vista
I go Hamas on the beats to a paradox on the beach
And a pair of crotchless underwear on a terrorist watch list
Gettin' head in the sand like an embarrassed ostrich
Professional shit sprayer
Bitch watch who you talkin' to, like Apple wristwear
Endangered species in this ABC shit a bit scarce
Preys decreasing, I face extinction like disc players
Told this chick she's hot as Jada Pinkett
And just stared 'til I made her think it
Said, "Maybe we should just get married."
She's facing me, I placed my feet with my hips square
Tell her, "Turn around," spread her legs for me, then I hit bare
Leave her stretched out like a baby T-shirt on Ric Flair
As I rip, tear, anal beads in a split rear
Spray Febreze in the chick's hair
Make her wheeze tryna get air
I played for keeps, there's no escaping me, I have a bitch scared
And chained to me, and throw away the key
And she'll be so afraid to leave
That even if she ends up breaking free she'll just sit there
Tryin' to scrape up enough courage and strength to get up
It's impossible like rapin' a slut
We stay butt-naked and fuck
You're close, wait for you, what?
My idea, you comin' too, is waking you up
With smelling salts after I Quaalude your cup
That'll straighten you up if you try to stray like a pup
Hate to get bogged down in details
But bitch, I'm like the dog pound with females
My brain is corrupt, real life, Hillside Strangler
I strangle a skank's neck 'til it's triangular
Shape but it's upside down, and my mouth ain't gonna shut
And mention me in your raps if it makes you a buck
Or helps you rake in the ducats, I want payment in pub
'Cause I ain't tryna get in your bars like I'm waiting the club
But if you put me in your lines, I'm takin' a cut

[Verse 2]
Get a million writers inside of a room combined in it
Try to get every idea of every possible line to spit
Every punchline, every combination that rhymes with it
Bitch, a whole team can't see me, there's no I's in it
Head so big, I shot myself ten times in it
Tryna commit suicide and it, took five minutes
And I survived the shit
Someone's gonna challenge me, who?
Battle me and win, that's a fucking fallacy too
You name one motherfucker in this galaxy, *spits*, reality
You fantasy, rally your troops, try to boost the morale
Only time I start a movement's a bowel
I can't even give a "yeah" or a "woo" when you rap in the booth
Not even a "nah" or a "boo"
'Cause even though I'm allergic to the crap that you spew
When I'm 'bout to break out, I don't mean get a rash from it too
'Cause when I say I have allergies, I actually do
But that's just an analogy, I've never had a reaction to you

[Verse 3]
Creature from the Black Lagoon
I reach up and I smack the moon
You're grief struck that I'm back so soon
Your teacher for this afternoon
Creep up with a pack of hoodlums
We pack a punch like Caprisun
Heat tucked like we each snuck in a sub-machine gun
We stuck in a submarine bun, with a bag of shrooms
Cup of lean up in the padded room
Justin Bieber in a Catholic school
Selling dust and reefer when your back is to him
Don't adjust your speaker
I'll cuss the stripes off of a fuckin' zebra when I'm at the zoo
Huffin' cleaner 'til I gag from fumes
Fuck Christina with a plastic spoon
While I bump some G-Funk and blast some Snoop
'Cause her double G-cups are massive, huge!
It's fun for me just to grab a boob
Plus my penis got an attitude
My fuckin' wiener's in a combative mood
Come and suck a mean one like it's mad at you
I speak tongue-in-cheek, what you asslicks do
'Cause you love to eat butt, it's sad but true

[Verse 4]
I just sprung a leak suddenly
What I think in my gut instinct become in sync
My thoughts and my stomach link up with each other
Ink touches the pad, then boom!
Since the day Dre gave me beats, I was made elite
That's basically what makes me me
Creating stink, 'til these tats are fading ink
Who's the greatest? Think we're still debating, wink
ADD, and better put out an APB
'Cause it'll take LAPD and me layin' in the street
For you to see Shady beat
And I'll bet ya they'd need cleats
'Cause I'd have to be stomped by forty men to suffer a defeat
I pray please Jesus to make me decent
Inhaling the main ingredient of pain relievers, and saline
I take three Aleves, tryna break these fevers, I'm ailing
I stay free of divas and ladies screamin'
'Cause they keep schemin' on me
Vading keepin' the women at bay
Like Laci Peterson, baby fetuses
Legs and feet have been weighted, chained in semen
It's straight demonand wait!
Even if it takes meat cleavers to make believers
Mistake-free schemes are enablin' me to remain deviant
Breakbeat, eat her like steak meat
Emcees take seats like AMC theaters
Deranged ringleader, depraved king
Who mainstream media hates
Which makes things easier, still under scrutiny
Villainous smooth criminal, livin' room
With the nude Reese Witherspoon
Who was bruised, beat with a broom
It's in two pieces, and lays deceased in it
Pit with a chewed leash, and his chain-link leapin' it
Live in the booth, shave, eat, bathe, drink, sleep in it
R-A-P bleed the shit, still and I poop, pee it
It's a spillage, a sewage leak, waist-deep feces
The syllables ooze fecal, they feel like renewed leases
'Cause my brain releases 'em

[Verse 5]
Like waste excretion, it's simultaneously
As I'm givin' these fools grief, they're feelin' the blues
'Cause even if stealin' my shoes, thieves
Just to fill 'em's a huge feat
A hill and it's too steep
Obey these demons, we're still in cahoots
Keep feedin' me blank sheets
As soon as I sink these teeth
And I'm killin' the loose leaf
Time to shake these trees again
Wait, make that phrase repeat again
Killin' the loose leaf, shake these trees again
Get the rake, but it ain't me leavin' 'em

[Verse 6]
Vicodins, Nuprins, I bite them and chew them
The whites and the blues mixed with nitrous balloons
And I like to sniff gluesticks, put Ricin on toothpicks
On the mic I'm just ruthless, a crisis, a nuisance
Who I influence I give two shits
If they wanna license my music to entice with
Then use the shit like it's the blueprint for ISIS recruitment

[Verse 7]
Excuse me while I stare into space for a few
In a daze or haze, glazed over, crazed warped loon
Mental cased off, always had a straight-forward view
But you bozos keep givin' the flamethrower fuel
No one's ever sank lower, shrewd, and way more rude
Beast-mode like a lawn-mower blade rolled through it
And this has little to do with bein' gay, boy
It's just where the wordplay's goin'
But ain't much I can say or do
'Cause ain't no excuse, the way I go at you {censored}
You say I'm always screw-faced
So if I look your way, you're screwed
'Cause if looks could kill, I could start a hate war too
'Cause I'd murder you straight bitches by turnin' the gaze on you

[Verse 8]
Let's take it back before the tightly-worn pants
To the Nike, Jordan, hats
The stripe Lee's, Jordache, and the white tees
Lightning storms might be formed fast
Such a frightening forecast
But when you're slightly hoarse, rasp
From the cyphering or-gasp, but still reciting your raps
While you're tightening your grasp around the mic 'cause you done shitted on it so much, you're always reminded of your past
'Cause your heiny's sore, that's
'Cause you still haven't finished fuckin' wiping your ass
From the night before last
No good, but rap somethin' I'm too-good-for-my-own-good at
Fuck adulthood, I'm a grown-up brat
Where your cojones at? Mine are always being rode, in fact
They're frozen, you ever seen a cul-de-sac?
So big they fell out my scrotum, I just sewed 'em back

[Verse 9]
Dick so long, need a shoulder-strap
For that, gotta unroll it and fold it back
So difficult to wrap in the prophylactic, it overlaps it
So I pack a Trojan so fat, when I lay it flat it's like a yoga mat
Make a bitch think she's in aerobics class
The bear you don't wanna poke is back
The backbone of rap, your fuckin' lead singles are my bonus tracks
When I appear, my peers stop
Hearts fall in their stomach, their spirits drop
Careers flop, their gears lock, severe shock
Fear at the mere thought
Lyrics are top-tier, I'm so high at the top
I'm in the sky when I talk
Bitch, I'm so fly when I walk, my ears pop

[Outro]
Oh, and I'm just playin' ladies, you know I love you
I got an idea for a line



[Eminem]
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standards you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them

[Evanescene] (x2)
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal

[Notorious B.I.G]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Runnin' from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make
(I repeat)
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make

[Evanescence] (x2)
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal

[2Pac]
But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed "Thug Life!" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police

[Evanescence] (x2)
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal

[Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
Theyve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin with a few true villains
Whose stand inside of the booth truth spillin
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths
Now rewind it!
Payback muthafucka for the way that you doubted me hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
Im Hannibal Lecter so just in case youre thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place
So Drake

[Evanescence] (x2)
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal



[Intro]
You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuckin' beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard (You want smoke)
We doin' this once
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? (Illa)

[Verse]
Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, "Woo!"
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines ("Slim, you're old")ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
Dictionary
"Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery," oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzinodie, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write "Not Alike"
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kellsattempt fails! BuddenL's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

[Outro]
You fuckin'oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you



[Produced by Dr. Dre & Mel-Man]

[Intro]
When I was just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized she was the crazy one
But there was nothing I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was

[Verse 1]
They said I can't rap about being broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more (Ahh)
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
'Til them vocal cords don't work in her throat no more? (Ahh)
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
Thinkin' I'm sayin' this shit 'cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it (Ahh)
Put your hands down, bitchI ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you (Ahh)
Shut up, slut! You're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slutokay, Ma?
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother
Abusing a whore, snorting coke
And we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"
You're goddamn right, bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicodin, *vrin vrin vrin!*
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

[Pre-Chorus]
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me

[Chorus]
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you (Ah, ha-ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I been through Hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't "acid rap," but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint?
No, just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No, Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth
Bitch, I'ma kill you! I ain't done, this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it
Three or four times in a tub, but that's normal, ain't it, Norman?
Serial killer hiding murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds and we want in yours: let us in

[Pre-Chorus]
Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me

[Chorus]
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you (Ah, ha-ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you

[Verse 3]
Know why I say these things?
'Cause ladies' screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
These 80Gs a week to say the same things tweece
Twice, whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots, I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em 'cause their ratings stink
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before school to outta school
I don't even believe in breathin'
I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got the machete from OJ
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
'Til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me!

[Pre-Chorus]
Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You don't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you!

[Chorus]
You don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you (Ah, ha-ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why not?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you

[Outro]
Ha-ha-ha, I'm just playing, ladies
You know I love you

[Intro]
When I was just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized she was the crazy one
But there was nothing I could do or say to try to change it
Cause that's just the way she was

[Verse 1]
They said I cant rap about being broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I wont choke no whore
'Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
Thinkin' I'm sayin the shit cause Im thinkin' it just to be sayin it
Put your hands down, bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you
Shut up, slut! Youre causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut  okay, Ma?
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother
Abusing a whore, snorting coke
And we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"
You're goddamn right, bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile vicious
Vain Vicodin, vrin vrin vrin!
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts  bitch, I'ma kill you!

[Pre-Hook]
You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me

[Hook]
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Cause why?)
Cause Shady will fucking kill you (Ha-ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
Cause Shady will fucking kill you

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I been through Hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't "acid rap," but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint?
No, just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No, Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him you give him an impulse
To do it again, then if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth
Bitch, I'ma kill you! I ain't done, this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it
Three or four times in a tub, but that's normal  ain't it, Norman?
Serial killer hiding murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds and we want in yours: let us in, or I'ma kill you!

[Pre-Hook]
You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me

[Intro: Eminem & Kim]
Aw, look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby, you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you
Sit down, bitch! You move again, I'll beat the shit out of you! (Okay!)

[Verse 1: Eminem & Kim]
Don't make me wake this baby!
She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do!
Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?!
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?!
Oh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first I'm like, "Aight, you wanna throw me out, that's fine!"
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?!
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim!
Look at your husband now! (No!) I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now, is he, little punk?!
(Why are you doing this?!) Shut the fuck up! (You're drunk!)
(You're never gonna get away with this!) You think I give a fuck?!
C'mon! We're going for a ride, bitch! (No!) Sit up front!
(We can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up?)
We'll be right back  well, I will, you'll be in the trunk

[Chorus: Eminem]
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

[Verse 2: Eminem & Kim]
You really fucked me, Kim, you really did a number on me!
Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim, I was only eighteen
That was years ago, I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up! (I love you!) Oh God, my brain is racin'
(I love you!) What are you doing? Change the station!
I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke? (No!)
There's a [four]-year-old little [boy]
Laying dead with a slit throat in your living room!
Ha-ha! What, you think I'm kiddin' you?!
You loved him, didn't you? (No!)
Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fucking lie to me!
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you, asshole! Yeah, bite me!
Kim? Kim! Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly, don'tchu? (It's not that!) No, you think I'm ugly
(Baby!) Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch me!
I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you!
Oh my God, I love you! How the fuck could you do this to me?!
(I'm sorry!) How the fuck could you do this to me?!

[Chorus: Eminem]
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

[Verse 3: Eminem & Kim]
Come on, get out! (I can't! I'm scared!)
I said get out, bitch! (Let go of my hair! Please don't do this, baby! Please! I love you! Look, we can just take Hailie and leave!)
Fuck you!
You did this to us! You did it! It's your fault!
"Oh my God, I'm crackin' up" Get a grip, Marshall!
Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party
And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
That was funny, wasn't it?! (Yes!)
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (No!)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up
And he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God!)  So now they both dead
And you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I shoulda known better when you started to act weird
We coulda hey, where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me, Kim! It's just us, nobody else
You're only making this harder on yourself!
Ha-ha, gotcha! Go ahead, yell!
Here, I'll scream with you, "Ah! Somebody help!"
Don't you get it, bitch? No one can hear you!
Now shut the fuck up, and get what's comin' to you!
You were supposed to love me!
Now bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed!

[Chorus: Eminem]
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can hear the drummer drummin'
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone
I know something's comin'
But I'm runnin' from it, to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was?
Was it too good to be true?
Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens?
Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
Cause here I sit in Lucifers den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin, even if it means I'm sellin' my soul
Just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that? Im somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark
This sport is somethin' I never bow-out at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are countin' me out
And I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about
Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here
But I'm not a quitter; gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
I'm tryna be headstrong
But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
Cause you're moving onto the next, but is your respect gone?
Cause someone told me that

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Kings never die

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't give me that sob story, liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features
And try to show out on a track with me
But it'd actually have to be
A fuckin' blow-out to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous
Comeback, as if I went away
But detractors just say so much for the renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage, and I feel like I'm in a cage
They so want a champion to fall
It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em
Cause why can't we win 'em all?
So fuck what these cynics say!
It just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta
With this pent-up rage, cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow, and I'm not gonna be

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I want it, I'm comin' to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck
Youre gonna get Riddick Bowed
Critics'll end up in critical
Think your shit is dope, all you're gonna get is smoked
And I ain't stopping 'til I'm on top again
All alone and on a throne, like a token of respect
Or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm
And launched so hard it broke my collarbone
And when it's my time to go
I'm still not leaving, stop for no one, I don't know
But I've been told, an obstacle that blocks your road, ya
Knock it over, time to go for the pot of gold, cause

[Bridge: Eminem]
They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly
So, hands up, reach for the sky!
Try to hold on and prolong these moments
Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over

[Verse 4: Eminem]
So you're tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leavin' this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus, I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness; kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
At Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas
Still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silverscreen
But Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat, cause makin' the beat
Aint the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
It's that sound-bombing, Thirstin Howl
Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz
Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone
God, just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Outro: Gwen Stefani]
Kings never die



[Eminem]
Yo, yo, I'll start it off, yo, yo
My name is Shady, his name is Proof
Yo, we used to have a roof up on my house
And now we had a mouse that ate the cheese out of the fridge
Didn't want to admit that I was on welfare when I was three
Plus, when I was four, my mother used to leave
She used to always slam the door and say
"Goodbye, goodbye, Marshall, I'm leaving, I'm single
And right now I'm going to mingle at bingo."
"Yeah, see you later, alligator," is what she said
And I would always stay at house, freezin' till I'm dead
'Cause it was cold inside that house, we never had no heat
Yo, Proof used to come walkin' up right up the street
And be like, "Yo, what up, Em? How you doin'?"
I used be like, "Yeah, man
It's good to see you, dawg, but my life's ruined
'Cause my mom just left," she left my brother Nate
And I hate the fact that we never had no food on our plate
So then Proof said: "What up, Em?"
Yo, so I said "Proof, won't you come in?"

[Proof]
Yeah, yeah, come in, whats up with dat?
Tango and Cash, came to mingle and blast
Together tougher than Alcatraz prison bars
Drivin' foreign cars
Yes, it's me and my man compadre
Black and white, white and ivory and black ebony
They can't step to me, rubbery and heavenly
They can't see us in the 313 vicinity
Ayo, Em, ha ha ha ha

[Eminem]
What up? Ha, ha, I'm comin' like ha ha
I'm ill like nah nah, and y'all don't wanna see me
'Cause I'm ill with the skill
And I can grill and I always keep it real
When I built my garage back after it just got burnt down
Sorry that my parents weren't always around
But it was really hectic growin' up
But now I'm blowin' up
So it don't matter: every show I do, I'm always showin' up
To the club drunk as hell, drunk as fuck, drunk as what?
Can't say that on MTV
But remember it? Little old wimpy me
Who used to always dream to be on MTV
Now you can't see me
I know you remember that rhyme
Ayy, wait a minute, yo check it out, I'm 'bout to flatline
Pass the mic back to Proof
'Cause we get loose, we drink gin and juice
Sip it 'cause we always raise the roof

[Proof]
Ayo, ayo, we all up in your sight like cataracts
Me and Em tag-team
Beat any of y'all on some battle rap
See us next time we strippin' out your Cadillac's
How you like that? Soon you down like a battle axe

[Eminem]
I'm down like a battle axe
I got a phatter axe to smash
And I smash your cataracts
'Cause it's a Cadillac's that I be drivin'
When I be high off fuckin' vivarin
Now you can't see me 'cause I'm revivin' and survivin'
In the D, every single day in Detroit
If rappers wanna step to me, they better get to the point
'Cause they don't understand the way that I do it
The fluid that I be spittin' is never written
'Cause I'm always, always bitten, 'cause it

[Proof]
Ayo, you make your neck crack like a snare pop
We're fresh and they're not
So give it up, don't even do this
You're wack, in fact you get flat-lined
You need practice
We stick you like a cactus
Nah, you're not a guy, you're an actress
The fact is

[Eminem]
Here's my address, this is my old address
And called a street called Dresden
Yo, dead presidents is what I'm resurrectin'
Gotta say what's up to Desmond and JLB
But yo, they don't help me
Do a thing, they never did
When I was a clever kid, rhymin'
I always used to go to school and climb in
The back baseball diamond

[Proof]
Hey yo, abort, hold up!
Hurt shoulder
Peace for Kurt Loder
Yeah, we're doin' an interview
In a minute or two
We're gonna enter in you

[Eminem]
In the nude, when we intrude
Don't mean to be rude
But yo, what's up, dude?
How you doin', MTV?
How you doin', Kurt?
How you doin' everybody else in the world?
You gettin' hurt
By this freestyle that I be comin' up with
Eruptin' and kick your mother in the tummy
And in the stomach

[Proof]
Ayo, ayo, and all of this we just done is freestyle
Ah, ah, ah, don't touch that dial, yeah

[Eminem]
Hold it right there, I'm your worst nightmare
Wipin' diapers on my high chair

[Proof]
What?! Yeah!

[Eminem]
When I was this big
Now I'm still bigger, but I'm skinny like a twig
Skinny little white boy
Growin' up I liked noise
I spike punch and light joints

[Proof]
Ayo, everybody looks for us to follow
We thrust the bottle, thrust the throttle
Bust a bottle over your head
Train your thoughts just like Cus d'Amato
Your guts is hollow
Back up, Proof and Em

[Eminem]
And all them wack MC's steppin' to me at Saint Andrews
Just remember that I hate you, and yo, I can't stand you

[Proof]
Yeah!

[Eminem]
Bye bye!
Goodbye, good night!
Bye bye, good night!
Bye bye, good night!

[Proof]
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye!



[Intro: Polina]
Tell me where to go
Tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say
No matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid
That would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffin' at authority, defiant often
Flyin' off at the handle at my mom
No dad, so I am noncompliant at home
At school I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlyin' problems
Thinkin' he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalkin' up drawings
On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'
To myself, either that or inside hidin' off in
The corner somewhere quiet, tryin' not to
Be noticed cause I'm cryin' and sobbin'
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker
Cause he said that I eye-balled him

[Pre-Chorus: Polina]
And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from all the wars
That are fought inside your world
Please have faith in my words

[Chorus: Polina]
Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'
Cause I obsess on everything in my mind, small shit
Bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara
Then split, but I dont give a shit
I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
Shit, look on the bright side, at least I ain't walkin'
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even tryin' to put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'?
They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eye-balled him
Grab hold of my balls, like, "That's right, fight's on, bitch!"
Who woulda knew, from the moment I turned the mic on, that
I could be iconic in my conquest?
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest

[Chorus: Polina]
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit
Now you shut up, bitch, I am talkin'
Thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fuckin' worship the ground on which I am walkin'
Me against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins
Cause you dicks butt kiss, bunch of Brian Baldingers
You're gon' die a ball-licker, I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind, y'all can
Suck a dick; the day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flyin' saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exaltin' and I ain't haltin'
'Til I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me, and I'm the Fire Marshall, and this is my

[Chorus: Polina]
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

There is a resilience that rises from somewhere deep within your streets
You can't define it, but you can feel it
You can feel it overflowing from the people who call you home
From people who are always proud to declare, 'I'm from Detroit'
You took our country from it's infancy, into industry
And your name still carries with it the idea of a nation built on steel, muscle and sweat
You became the city that carried the country
The city, like the sport, is built on dreams
People who would drive to you, driven to excel
Who know nothing is accomplished without hardwork, without sacrifice
When you hurt, we hurt
Your streets witness our struggle
Your bricks are our rage through the emptiness of each house shuttered, of each factory closed
We've lived through the ups and the downs
But we remain, Detroit
We can never turn our backs on you Detroit, because we are you
My home
The home of Motown, Cadillac and Joe Louis
Through all this, we cannot be defeated, because we have never been defeated
You've built us, you've moved us, you've shaped us
Sometimes down, but never out
Take strength in us, your people

Stay up Detroit




Dear Afeni

Sorry if it looks a little sloppy, I could've done a little better if I had the right pencils. Instead, I had to draw it in pen. Plus, I just kind of thought of the idea a little too late. But I've been drawing since I was 10, and I thought you might like it. Anyways, thank you for always being so kind to me. You are a true Queen, and I mean that in every sense of the word. I will never forget the opportunities you have given me. You will always be in my heart, my thoughts, and my prayers. As I have said before, you have no idea how much your son and his music has inspired, not only the "Hip Hop" world, but, speaking for myself, has inspired my whole career. He was, and still is, the true definition of a "Soldier." When I was feeling at my worst; (before fame, before Dre) I knew I could put that "2Pac" tape in, and suddenly, things weren't so bad. He gave me the courage to stand up and say "F**k the world!" "This is who I am! And if you don't like it, go f**k yourself!" Thank you for giving us his spirit, and yours! God Bless you!

Love

Marshall



I stay higher than racial tension, with a facial expression
Tensed up like I'm suffering from a case of nasal congestion
Eyes hazel, complexion beige, age still in question
Critics hate my tape, kids can't wait for the next one
As long as there's rejects, my tape never ejects the deck
That's the level of respect each CD gets
While ya'll graspin at straws like me snorting crushed Aspirin
And gasping at air and collapsing in malls
I'm just a realistic impression of artistic expression
Whose tape was in the deck when kids shot up the delicatessen
So when I launch a verse full of controverse
That'll haunt you worse than Ma$e before he joined a church (P Diddy!)
I'm sorry kids I dismissed this class
I'm going back in the broom closet to sniff this gas
Um, Mr. Mathers just missed the bathroom
Pissed his pants and the world still kissed his ass
This is my last album cause this is my last Valium
Just pick my ass up when I pass out in the bathroom
If ya'll don't like the shit that you're hearing
Then blow me til your lipstick is smearing
And I can see my dick disappearing

May 23rd
That means we're taking over this year, you heard? (x2)
Yo, May 23rd



[Intro]
Yeah, shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to, agree
But if you feel like me

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Someone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet? He's tryin' to divide us
This shit's like a cult, but like Johnny he'll only unite us
'Cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come
To pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from
When we cant from our stars and stripes cause
This type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
And band together for Charlottesville
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
Spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better
America, and here's to where it all

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off
Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler!
But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing "The Star-Spangled Banner"
This man just praised a statue of General Lee
'Cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand
At the event or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart
Our sacred land we cherish and stand for
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we all

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

[Bridge: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know
There's no place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go, no place like home
No place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go (Yeah)

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home



[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I never drag 'em in battles that I can't handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some JAY-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it that I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, that's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?
That wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, cause

[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated  it ain't just words no more, is it?
It's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
But we still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at the jaws, well, then I can, cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause

[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers



[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that it's sorta unique
'Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like tryin' to smoke crack
And go to sleep, I'm strapped
Just knowing any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
For you to play me, it's cockamamie
You just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cockadoodle, my clocks cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeah, the whole kitten-kaboodle
I'm just brutal. It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin' with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it

I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it

A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 3: T.I]
I'm the man in my city ain't nobody wit me
You can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches
I'm a known drug dealer I always have 50's
And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
SS'S on 26's watching some television
Shorty I'm never slipping got the berretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
Pimp stolen the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
Polices try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children
Think I'm bad now, shoulda seen me before I had children
Give dick to ya daddy's daughter and dare her to have children?
Hope he got some insurance 'cause death her is enduring?
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her to Missouri
Still my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme

[Intro]
Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?

[Verse 1]
Yo! His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, overblaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' optionfailure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

You can do anything you set your mind to, man

[Instrumental]



[Intro]
Yo, if you could just, for one minute
Or one split second in time, forget everything
Everything that bothers you
All your problems, everything, and follow me

[Verse 1]
If I was froze inside of a moment
If I could capture time inside a capsule, an hourglass full
Of sand in the palm of my hand, it passes through it
If I can grasp it and just control what happens to it
Then I can trap it, so no more time elapses through it
If raps could do it, maybe I could tap into it
Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks
To transmit through 'em, to make you put your ass into it
And that's when you hit the roof because you can't sit through it
Your passions too much for you to not be dancin' to it
And as you do it, your movements become fast and fluent
You're mashin' to it, moshin' 'til you're black and bluish
You're actin' foolish, this music it has influenced
You to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion, true it's
Chaotic but it's got your body movin' as a unit
Unitin' together tonight, so make it last and you better just

[Hook]
Lose yourself in this music, this moment
We own it, we won't never let it go (go)
You better move yourself 'cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate (you better)
Lose yourself in this music, this moment
We own it, we won't never let it go (Go)
You better move yourself 'cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate
You better

[Verse 2]
'Cause when we descend together, we begin to move as one
In perfect unison just like the moon and sun
Illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum
Rhythmically in sync, if you'll excuse the pun
But if you could lose it once, I mean if you could let shit go
Relax, take a breath, and just let it exit slow
To rest your soul, you could leave the rest to me
If I could give the world a hit of ecstasy
To make 'em feel the feelin' that I'm feelin' right this minute
'Cause I feel like the night won't end 'til I get finished
So close the shades, makin' sure no light gets in it
The sky's the limit tonight because the night's infinite
A high percentage of black people and white mixed in it
But no one really gives a fuck 'cause they just like what's spinnin'
His life was spinnin', the whole entire night just spinnin'
Like life's beginning
So come out from inside your skin and quit hidin' in it

[Hook]
Lose yourself in this music, this moment
We own it, we won't never let it go (go)
You better move yourself 'cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate (you better)
Lose yourself in this music, this moment
We own it, we won't never let it go (Go)
You better move yourself 'cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate
You better



(intro)
Look..
If you had one shot...

Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when its
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortar
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da da dumb da dumb da da
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much
For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
You can do anything you set your mind to, man



For all the ladies out there
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
And now you're lying in the corner, crying

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Something's burnin', I can't figure out what (out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded; must
Just be the powder from the power of (love)
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon-to-be-spouses moan?
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurtsbrace!
Hope it ain't, "Here we go, yo!"
Cause my head already goes to worst-case
Scenario, though in the first place
But you confirmed my low-end theory though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
"No, (*slurp*) you don't (*slurp*) under (*slurp*) stand, (*slurp*)
I (*slurp*) don't (*slurp*) do this for (*hic*) anyone, (*hic*) ever (*slurp*)."
Yeah, that ain't what they all say?
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fianc
'Til you sucked on Wayne, Andr, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow da Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwam
Guess I'm gettin' my g-goddang Jigga on, eh?
Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin' the

[Bridge: Wayne Fontana]
Game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I told that bitch, "I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick."
Suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
"Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fuckin' Ferris wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on mefuck you think, we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmama better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it
Or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day." (*Phone hangs up*) Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me deep as Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home training
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin', "I hope she's good enough
Meanwhile you're chasin' her"
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the

[Bridge: Wayne Fontana]
Game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (with Eminem)]
(She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more)
(She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more)
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record clich
It's all my fault anyway, she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together, but forgot today was her B-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding, but just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit comin' up
What the mother-F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt
Hit a fuckin' tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racin' at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried the stink ho in it, then paid to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, cause she's layin' next to me in beddirectly aimin' a gat at my head!
Woke up again and jumped up
Like, "Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab."
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic
I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, "Hit the road", then after she left
I sent that bitch a text that said, "Be careful driving
Don't read this and have an accident"
She glanced to look at it and wrecked (*Car crashes*)
Too bad, thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oral and mace
Who fell from grace 11 stories for storytellin'
While the whore was yellin', "Rape!"
'Til her vocal cords were swellin'
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date though
You're late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of (*Message sound*)
Wait, "dinner at eight"? I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the

[Outro: Wayne Fontana]
Game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love



[Intro: Obie Trice]
You don't see me in the hood
That's 'cause I'm doin' this, man

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Niggas, I'm still grindin' (yeah), I still hearin' those sirens
I'm still gettin' chased by those lights
Only the light's lime, and my mic's on
And my time is none, because I'm writin' more
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this business
Im here to eat, speak, until these hoes feel this (for sure)
And I cant let y'all derail me, man
I got Young Kobie, homie, you gotta let go of Obie
'Cause Obie be back, (going nowhere, man) we got them craps goin' on
And that 'ac goin' on, soon as a nigga touch down, back from tourin'
It's whatever, put that on the cheddar, man
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Iovine time
Chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out
This is it my niggas, this what we boast about
Now I'm here, so shut your motherfuckin' mouth, and show me love, bitch

[Hook]
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life (I don't love you, bitch)
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night

[Interlude: Obie Trice]
(I don't love you, bitch)
Right we wanna love alcohol
We wanna love guns, we wanna love money
We don't love no bitches, though

[Verse 2: Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice
That's sorta unique 'cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep, and I'm Stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like tryna smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money
You can't pay me enough for you to play me
It's cockamanie, you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's cuckoo
I got screws loose, yea the whole kit and caboodle, I'm just brutal
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin' with a swollen bowlin' ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass, you better love me, bitch

[Hook w. (Obie Trice adlibs)]
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night (and all the bitches say)
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name
If it ain't about the flow, it's 'bout the stones and the chain
If I was you, I'd love me too, I roll like a boss
911 Porsche same color as cranberry sauce
I ain't gon' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit
Let me find out he fuckin' 'round with Bow Wow bitch
Niggas eatin' popcorn right, rewindin' the tape
Now shorty mama in precinct, hollerin' rape
I'm convinced, man, somethin' really wrong with these ho's
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fuckin' with her nose
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats
That boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell
My back shots'll help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big been taught Charli B'More to deep-throat (Yeah)

[Hook]
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night (and all the bitches say)
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night

[Collision: 50 Cent]
I love the burners
The money, the bunnies, I just wanna hold ya
I just wanna love ya



[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it  "Wait!
Where you going?"  "I'm leaving you!"  "No, you ain't!
Come back!"  We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, "Who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time! I a-
-pologize, even though I know it's lies, I'm tired
Of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
Just gonna

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie



[Intro]
Still love me? Take this
You ready? One, two, three!

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 1]
It's sick but who could ever predict, we'd be doin' the same shit
We say we do it for our baby but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust 'cause neither one
Of us trust each other, so we fuck 'til we bust
And we cuss each other out
We know what it's about, shout
'Til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 2]
'Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
In our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof, 'til they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed
If you didn't I wouldn't be hittin'  yeah, I would
'Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm?
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know, that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope, the only reason that I cope is 'cause of that fact
And plus I can bust in that and that's why

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 3]
I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh, why must we try? Is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff?
Try to pull each other's legs, until the other begs
We're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it, yeah!
'Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin'
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent-up rage
We both had, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we've both been someone else's "someone else"
Problem is neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
On every song, every lyric and every rhyme
All the hoopla, all of the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cause this time, girl, I'm tellin' you what
You do it again, I'm fuckin' you up

[Bridge]
No matter what you say, or what you do
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you, in your nightmares
So I brought you the flowers and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
Told me you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out, you can't escape me, whore

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more



[Hook]
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

[Verse 1]
Warning, this shit's gon' be rated R, restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self-inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma, "Bitch, you got a sick kid"
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
'Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
(Murder-murder, redrum)
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from?
Inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated
"How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?"
Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out (RRRAH!), killed the bitch and did her
Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?
Bring your bitch, I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her

[Hook]
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

[Verse 2]
I lace tunes, that's out this world like space moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin' brains like graze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippets, passed out like sampler snippets
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Lace it up with cocaine so he can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the rum
Or any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
Dandruff's making my neck itch, what the fuck? Give me the check bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap dips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, then probably one of us broke in

[Hook]
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

[Verse 3]
My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Blitzin' like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin (Allah, Allah)
Delinquent, choking microphones with broken English
Make your mama be like "Whoo, this is good! Who sings this?"
"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I dug it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit"
It was predicted by a medic, I'd grow
To be an addicted diabetic, living on liquid Triaminic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicking, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen mannequin, posin' stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying, God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it lives
The closest they gon' come is 2Pac
It's politics, it's all a fix
Set up for these white blue-collared hicks
It's to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
For those who kiss ass and swallow dicks

[Hook]
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

[Intro: Joyner Lucas]
Whoa, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of nines
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cllate boca mejor, maricn, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

[Bridge: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, "What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
I said, "I don't have any answers."
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, "What a wonderful feeling!"
"We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice



[Intro: Joyner Lucas]
Whoa, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, ho fatto un sacco di cose in passato, lo ammetto
Non mi rimangio quello che dico, se l'ho detto allora intendevo ci
In tutta la mia vita ho voluto un grammy, ma probabilmente non lo avr mai
Non ho mai avuto un trofeo o una cazzo di coccarda (Yah l'ho detto)
Fanculo il sistema, sono quel negro, piega la legge, taglia le regole
Sto per rischiare tutto quanto, non ho troppo da perdere
Avete mangiato fin troppo tempo,  il mio turno di togliere il cibo
Passa il piatto! Dov' il mio drink? Questo  il mio giorno, fortunato tu
Fanculo anche a te woo!

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Dovete spostarvi, dovete spostarvi, dovete spostarvi
Fatemi spazio, fatemi spazio, datemi il rispetto
Salto fuori dalla coupe, salto fuori dalla coupe, salto fuori e sparo
Dovete spostarvi, dovete spostarvi, datemi il rispetto

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Indietro alle mie stronzate, la mia schiena al muro
Vi volto le spalle, siete tutti finiti
Indietro a questi proiettili, si ritorna al lavoro
Tiro fuori il mio MAC e tutti voi correte
Indietro alla merda sul blocco, si ritorna allo spaccio
Questi pacchi e in realt sto pompando
Non posso fottere con voi rapper, praticamente voi succhiate cazzi
Potrete aver fatto platino, ma quello non significa niente
Sto per fare un casino sta volta
Dritto fuori dalla cucina, gli ho detto che il forno  mio
Non fotto con voi ragazzi
Se non vi uccido, sappiate che soffrirete questa volta
Non sono un gangster, ma ho qualche pistola
Qualche catena e qualche lama e un paio di nove millimetri
Mannaie e pistole, una pernice, un pero
I miei "Dodici giorni di Natale" non furono nient'altro che bugie
Vi corro incontro come un lottatore di sumo (sumo)
Poi dicono che parlo come un coglione (coglione)
Vivo su Marte ma non sono Bruno (woo)
Stronzo sono un cane, chiamami Cujo (rah)
Tu giochi le tue carte, io te le rimando indietro
E potrei metterne gi quattro come a Uno (bup)
 meglio che tu stia zitto, frocio, puttanella e tutti voi codardi
Hanno inventato un level up nel ghetto per diventare vecchi
Cercando qualcosa che probabilmente non posso trovare
Questa merda diventa importante finch un altro beef non muore
In realt un negro mi vuole legato e basta
Sono sempre stato solo e non ho mai avuto bisogno di nessuno
Solo me e la mia mitraglietta, dir a questi negri di giacere per terra
Tenetevi i soldi, non ho mai voluto quello stile di vita
Prego solo Dio affinch mio figlio stia bene, ora
Ho detto niente amore per l'altra sponda
O per qualcuno che voglia del fumo (Joyner)
Quando morir verr ricordato come l'underdog che non ha mai perso la speranza
Sei nel taxi sbagliato sul sentiero sbagliato
Negro, via sbagliata, strada sbagliata
I serpenti nell'erba cercano di strisciare in fretta
Ho appena comprato un fottuto tosaerba

[Bridge: Eminem]
Ho detto tante cose nella mia vita, lo ammetto
Questo  in qualche modo una vendetta, mi pento di averle dette
Ho vinto un paio di Grammys ma ho venduto l'anima per averli
Non era per i trofei, solo per il fottuto riconoscimento
Quale cazzo  la differenza?
Sono io quel bianco, piega la legge, fanculo le regole
Ero solito rischiare tutto, ora ho troppo da perdere
Ho mangiato abbastanza, il mio stomaco dovrebbe essere pieno
Ho appena mangiato, lecco il piatto, questo  il mio buffet, beato me
Che cazzo pensi? (woo!)
Ho un po' di ville
Non ho ancora maniere
Tu hai un paio di ghost writer
Ma a questi bambini in realt non importa
Mi chiedono, "Che cazzo  successo all' hip-hop"
Ho detto  "Non ho alcuna risposta."
Perch ho incassato una sconfitta quando ho fatto uscire il mio ultimo album
Mi ha fatto veramente male ma sono ritornato questi rapper
E venendo veramente da umili origini+
In qualche modo vincendo non sono a mio agio
Vorrei poter dire "Che senzazione meravigliosa!"
Stiamo facendo il botto come se stessimo spingendo il soffitto
Ma sembra che nessuno abbia delle cazzo di abilit
Perfino per mantenersi su un argomento, questo mi uccide
L'inabilit di mantenere l'umilt
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, perch non facciamo un mucchio di
Fottute canzoni sul niente e ci balbettiamo sopra?
Fanculo, andr per la giugulare
Questa merda  un circo, voi clown che uscite fuori
Non date il minimo cazzo di peso
A quelli che erano qui prima di voi che avete fatto rap
Ricapitoliamo, prima gli MC spaccavano sulle cassette
ADAT, dove sono i G Rap e i Kane?
Abbiamo bisogno di 3 mazzette da 1000 il prima possibile, e riportate Masta Ace
Perch la met di questi rapper hanno un danno cerebrale
Tutto quel rappare sulla lean, quei tatuaggi in faccia, sciroppati come la linfa di un albero
Non odio la trap e non voglio sembrare infuriato
Ma in effetti, dov' il vecchio me? Lo stesso gatto
Che prenderebbe quel feed-back e risponderebbe, ne ho bisogno
Ma credo che sia inevitabile
Sanno quale bottone premere o quale leva tirare
Per farmi scattare (troietta)
E se gli do ascolto probabilmente peggioro le cose
Ma avete preso i vostri cazzi nel culo, troia (capito?)
Ullorlo, ogni minuto mi faceva pensare di finire
Tutto con acetominofene e raccoglierne i benefici
Sono di nuovo addormentato al volante
Mentre penso all'intento malvagio
Di uccidere un altro beat
Perch anche se dovessi finire di nuovo ad ingoiare un'altra pillola
Anche se fosse ketamina o metanfetamina con il minithin
Dovrebbe essere almeno dai 70 ai 300 milligrammi
E potrei anche farlo, perch finir di nuovo ad essere un cattivo
Questo ha dei livelli, io ho un ascensore
Non potresti mai dirmi che non sono un cazzo di distruttore di record
Sembro un disco rotto ogni volta che infrango un record
Nessuno potrebbe mai cancellare l'eredit che ho lasciato, non ho mai compiaciuto
Figlio di puttana, so che ora ho il diritto di essere cos
Ho il dispetto nel mio DNA
Ma ho scritto finch le ruote non si staccano, sto lavorando senza mai stancarmi, ayy
 il momento che aspettavate tutti
Come la California che spera che diluvi
In quella siccit, avete tutti pregato per
La mia caduta da 8 Mile a Southpaw
Ancora lo stesso Marshall, quel fuorilegge
Del quale dicono che come scrittore potrebbe essere caduto
Sono tornato su quel toro come i cowboy

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]
Dovete spostarvi, dovete spostarvi, dovete spostarvi
Fatemi spazio, fatemi spazio, datemi il rispetto
Salto fuori dalla coupe, salto fuori dalla coupe, salto fuori e sparo
Dovete spostarvi, dovete spostarvi, datemi il rispetto



[Vocal Intro: Eminem]
Yo, Manix man, I think I just spotted my prey
There she is; check her out
Yea I know she's with her man and everything but...
I can still get her man, 'cause you know me
Just drop a couple of smooth rhymes on her
And I got her you know what I'm saying?
Aight, I'll tell you what I'mma do about her man!
Aight, Check this out...

[Verse]
Hey baby, let me have a word with your man
(comic-like slap sound) - now lemme show ya exactly where I stand
I'd like you to enter my fortress
Just cause you are just the most gorgeous
Woman I've ever seen and for just
The next few hours of ya life I'd like to
Bring out the real woman inside you despite you
Might be in love and all that with your, man
But lemme get chat with you
Why don't we get to know each other, haven't you
Ever wondered what it was like to date an M.C.?
Now what's a woman like you, without a man like me?
And someone like yourself I can grow very fond of
Beyond a doubt and I would always hold onto your
Love, and be faithful I promise
Cause I'm as
Loyal as a puppy, and I'd treat you like a goddess
That we would've stumble onto each other but first, wait
Before you're lured, I want to know if you're insured
And if you're sure, you're gonna be able to endure
A tremendous amount of pain that seems endless
Strenuous brawn and brain, but yet when this
Whole thing is over and I make it through the ride
Then I'd gladly stand by your side



[Eminem]
Hi, my name is, my name is nobody famous
Guess what? I'm an anus
I'm here with Mancow, haha
You know how I do it, cause I kick this fluid when i do it
I bust it, I kill it and I crush it with Mancow
You don't understand how we do it
We land now with hits and freestyle flows
Cuz we the ish, I said ish backwards and guess what that is...
Shhh, yea I can't say that, yo, hit the playback
Check it, cause rappers don't know how to display that
Rhymes that I be kicking, freestyle when I be kicking
Sticking these, ribs sticking out, poverty stricken
I'm all hungry cause I ain't ate in ten minutes
I'm infinite, oh, hey, check it out, I'm Ken Kaniff

Oh, hi there man, oh yeah
Hell no bro, oh yeah, no, yeah
Oh here I am I'm chillin' with Mancow
You know how we do it man you know we got the know how
Mancow kick a freestyle



[Eminem & Van Rental Service]
(*dialing tone*)

(*speaking in another language and laughing*)
And a van, men in the van (*laughing*)



[Intro]
You know, I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody, this year I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around
Like I owe 'em somethin'
The fuck you want from me, 10 million dollars?
Get the fuck outta here

[Hook 1]
You see, I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)

[Verse 1]
Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead Rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
Or leanin' out a window with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Looking for Big's killers, dressin' ridiculous
Blue and red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off 'cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wrist watches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Startin' shit like some 26 year old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it!)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill *NSYNC, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch, retarded? Give me back my 16 dollars!
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
Whatever happened to wilin' out and being violent?
Whatever happened to catchin'
A good old-fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'
And gettin' your shoes, coat and your hat tooken

[Bridge]
New Kids on the Block suck a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it (Hahaha)

[Verse 2]
Vanilla Ice don't like me (Uh-uh)
He said some shit in Vibe to spite me (Yo)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (Haha)
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin' "I don't care, just bite me!" (Na-na)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little four year old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves clowns cause they look queer
Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live 20 miles away (Fuckin' punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck  blaow!
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10
And I don't need help from D12 to beat up two females
In make-up who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
"Slim Anus"? You damn right, slim anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots

[Hook 2]
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (You talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
If you assholes doubt me (Assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth
Then come take your best shot at me (Best shot at me)

[Verse 3]
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
"Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy"
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for 10 million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it, bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter, [your attorney Fred Gibsons a] faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Ugh!)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden I got 90-some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!)
And then to top it off I walked to the news stand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Uh, here, "XXL! XXL!"
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Aw, fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

[Hook 1]
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)
Because I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)



[Intro]
You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody, this year I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em something
The fuck you want from me, ten million dollars? Get the fuck outta here

You see I'm just Marshall Mathers
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run their mouth and try to take shots at me

You might see me jogging, you might see me walking
You might see me walking a dead rottweiler dog

All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
Whatever happened to wiling out and being violent?
Whatever happened to catching a good old-fashioned
Passionate ass-whooping and getting your shoes, coat and your hat tooken

[Bridge]
New Kids on the Block sucked a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots
In public, I'mma love it

[Intro: Maxine & Denuan Porter]
Maxine!
Hello
Can I speak to Maxine?
Yeah, this is me, what's up?
What up?
Who dis?
Denaun
Yeah, what's up?
What are you doing?
Nothing, just laying in bed
Huh?
Nothing, just laying in bed
Why?
I don't know, thinking about something freaky to do

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I know this crack fiend, Maxine, who needs a vaccine
She tests positive, but tells you that her act's clean
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Gassin' every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
If you mistook her, sadly, on her reputation
You're in jeopardation, if you ain't got no preparation
When you stepped away, son, she got her face done
Lookin' provocative, she'll let you knock it if
You press the issue, and get undressed to kiss you
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
To go to the emergency 'cause it burns to pee
Don't bring your germs to me, 'cause I ain't tryna hear it
While you're fightin' your fuckin' disease, tryna clear it

[Verse 2: Kon Artis]
Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose in life?
That is to get with every brother
And unveil one of his kids
Shit, you livin' trife
Got three kids at home, and club-hoppin' every night
You say it's gonna stop
But it just slows down
And then speeds back to a regular pace
There is no end to this
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
When you got niggas hidin' in your closet?
I refrain from gettin' angry
But you keep on actin' strangely

[Verse 3: 3]
I met this girl last week
She was a freak, and she liked me
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number
I stepped to her, first I cleared my throat
And said: "Hey, bitch, haven't I seen you before?"
Looked at my nigga, turned around and got slapped
Throughout my hands, and said: "Oh, it's like that?"
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
She started cryin', and asked me to forgive her and shit
She said her name was Maxine
So I told her I wanted her number
She asked could I give her mine too
Got to the crib and called her up
We got into a good conversation
That's when she asked me could I fuck
I said: "Maxine, check this out
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out."
Got to the crib, she let me in
She didn't waste time, she grabbed my hand
And proceeded to the bedroom
I said "Hold up, and stop proceedin', you rushin' things"
What the fuck are you doin'?
So I went for my protection
Took off my clothes and started flexin'
As she went for my midsection
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about puttin' in work
Before I hit it she said: "3, don't get mad
But there's somethin' that I gotta tell your ass."
I said "What is it? Another nigga? It's okay."
She said: "No I forgot to tell you
That I got AIDS, I got a problem."

[Outro: Maxine & Denaun Porter]
Hey, Maxine
What?
You thinkin' about suckin' my dick?
Yeah, for a small price
For a small price? What you mean?
You know, money, nigga
You don't need no damn money; I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit
What you, what you hear I got?
AIDS
Who told you that bullshit?
My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie
Well, if that's the case, Kyu got it then
Oh for real, it's like that?
Well, I ain't got shit, so he ain't got shit
And if he do, he ain't get that shit from me
I ain't fuckin' around with no third nigga
Fuck that, I ain't fuckin' with you
No, see
You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you
Hold on, why it ain't even like that
I want y'all to get paid, fuckin'



[Intro: Eminem]

1, 2, 6, 8, 10...

[Verse 1: Eminem in the style of Vanilla Ice but rapping as himself]

YO! I'm Back, to bust another fresh track
You say, that I have the ability to fly
Fly right pass ya ass, when I blast
Ya everytime I grab the mic, I crash a-
Nother rhyme it's a crash landin'
Everytime I grab the mic, I'm kinda outstandin'
Cuz no-one can step to, a single a rhyme
And I say " Yo, what kept you?
Holmes, you going too slow
You're too slow for the flow " and I know
That Eminem is returning
To bust the rhyme and suckers are learning
That when I kinda go offbeat a little bit
I step back to the rhyme and say
That I bust a rhyme all day
Make a sucka say "Hey!
I cannot step to you Eminem
Cuz you are so bad, Damn
You're the baddest motherfucker in the whole damn land"
And you're right, cuz I am
And I don't go offbeat, not once
Cuz I grab the mic and bust for months
And I don't give nobody another turn
Cuz everytime I grab the mic, I don't let a brother burn
Because he can't step to a single rhyme that I do
Cuz you knew you're through

[Verse 2: Proof (rapping as MC Hammer)]

Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Now I grab the microphone, you know I am imperial
Is a production that rocking your stereo
Don't front with me, cuz I am the boy
I get on the microphone and I destroy
Now you can take a body, that's not from Oakland
Hammer, Hammer, Hammer keeps on choking, yeah
I can do it right and nobody will know
For I am the Hammer and I'm running the show
They come from West Indies south of California
I wake you motherfuckers up, early in the morning, yo front!

[Interlude: Eminem (hereafter rapping as Vanilla Ice)]

Yo Hammer, that was pretty good man
I don't think I can step to you man, I don't know
(Proof:  ... I'm great!)
I'll just try but it seems like you outdo me, no matter what I do
(Proof shouts something unintelligible)
Here I go anyway

[Verse 3: Eminem]

Here I am, back to attack the whole damn land
You know that Vanilla Ice is hype
I grab this mic and I rhyme all night
MC Hammer cannot step to me
Because I got the rhymes and I'm truly
So damn hype and the place to be
I'm rhyming on the mic on the M-I-C
M-I-C is the abbreviation
I grab the mic and rock the whole nation
You know that Vanilla Ice, is so precise and I get so nice
Get so nice, I start developing manners
And I whoop your brain like "Scanners"
Because Vanilla Ice is bad
Now what you got to say about that dad?

[Interlude: Proof]

You can't step to me boy
I sell more records!
Yo. I know here I go.  Yo Manny gimme something yeah!

[Verse 4: Proof]

Now everytime I go, you know I like to start
My name is MC Hammer
I rule hip hop charts
Seven million seven million seven million sold
And your shit barely even touch gold!
Now everywhere I go, they know that I'm a star
I'm the  H -A-M,  the M -E -R
Cuz every time I rock it they know I rock the mic
I am MC Hammer
And you know what I am like, ROAR!

[Interlude]

Eminem:  I don't know man, I think you got me, man. I don't know. I'mma try.  Check this out.  Fallin'...
(Music speeds up)
Proof:  Ain't no one here you sucka!
(Music returns to normal)

[Verse 5: Eminem]

Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in the car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I try to get away 'cause the jackers jack
So I step to the rhyme and I just say I'm
Gonna bust a rhyme for the whole damn mind
Then you say that I cannot bust a rhyme
But you gonna get got MC Hammer
Because you know you get on the mic
And drop poor grammar
And you can't slam a jam because I know that I am the man
And all the teenagers they like ME
You know why? It's a scheme agents
Have developed to sell me
Because I bust a rhyme so cleverly
And you know that I got knowledge
Cuz I'm in show biz
And I bust a rhyme all the time
So MC Hammer you cannot step to
A single rhyme that I do cuz I knew
That you are through, you are washed up
Oh, so step to the back room
And I told you that I have to scold you
Because I am Vanilla Ice
I grab this mic and I get so precise
And you cannot step
So why don't you get swept?

[Interlude: Proof]

Now you makin' me mad boy
Now I'm gonna get your ass
Now you gonna know who's on this motherfuckin' mic! Yo!

[Verse 6: Proof]

It's about time that I turned out your lights
Now I see the Vanilla Ice tryin' a chill in my freezer
You just don't know that your mama is a geezer
She say Hammer, yo Hammer, yo Hammer Hammer Hammer
But she jump on me because I'm a bad mamma jamma
I did your bitch, Hammer don't play
I got the funky shit and it goes this way
I wish your whole ass try to step, you can't touch this
You fuck with the Hammer you'll be walking on crutches
Yeah that's what I'm sayin', I ain't playin'
I'm Hammer, I'm Hammer, yes it's the Hammer Man
My lips may be big but I can rap better
Than looking at your ass, you look like a piece of cheddar!
Yo though you steppin' to me, you know it's no dream
I dig Vanilla Ice and turn his ass into whipped cream
So you know who's the best by far
It's the muthafuckin' HammeR with a capital R, roar!

[Interlude]

Eminem: Now you made me mad.  And you know what happens when you make Vanilla Ice mad Hammer?
Proof:  What?
Eminem:  I don't like it.  So yo! (Pauses)
Proof: You scared boy?
Eminem: I ain't scared of you, Hammer. I'm just thinking. I gotta think of something clever
Eminem whispers: Ice Ice baby, too cold too cold

[Verse 7: Eminem]

When I'm through with you
You'll be goin' to heaven
Cuz I smash the glasses and fuck 3-5-7
24/7 they was bangin' my cock
I said "yo fuck Hammer
Get a piece of the rock, yeah"
I said yeah. My name is Vanilla Ice, you can't
Step to me, you thought that you was a champ
But I stepped on your ass like a piece of carpet
And rented you for sale like an upstairs apartment
Yo, that's my clever metaphor
And every time I grab the mic you know
Kids like me cuz I'm better for
Their ears, because their mothers and parents
Like to hear the way I rhyme and I make an appearance
And say hey, I got a blond streak
And that's why people like me cuz I'm hard as concrete
I'm always on beat when I do this show
You know that Vanilla Ice has to go cuz I'm so damn fresh!

[Verse 8: Proof]

Now you steppin' to me punk
There is no maybes
You steppin' to me wrong and I'm gonna ICE ya baby!
So you say what's the matter, why Hammer loves to rap
Cuz all that shit you talkin' to Hammer is bullcrap
Now I know a rhyme every day I'm ready
I'm down with Dougie Fresh, Van-L is not ready
Now everywhere I go, on MTV Rap
They know I'm the best cuz now I don't take no crap
Now Vanilla Vanilla he's beaming out Hammer
They say yo Hammer don't put me on the slammer
I said yo sucka, stupid muthafucka
You messin with me but I'm no sucka
I already pumped it up, and already got it started
So steppin to me white muthafucka you'll feel broken-hearted
So I'm gonna pass the mic and you know about me
Hammer get off the fuckin' mic!!! I'm outie!

[Outro: Eminem]

You blew me out, man, you beat me



[Intro]
Oh my goodness, what have I done?
Oh no, I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm
And I'm ready to drop bombs

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca, Rebecca
It's the village in New York, right next to the Tribeca
That's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector
I said, nice rectum, I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lecter in the guy section, I bet ya
I tantalize ya and in less than five seconds I get ya
They say once bitten then twice shy, well lie next to the guy
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities, why yes sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
That's my kind of vibe, what else should I try, Lester?
Drop-kick the bitch before her second trimester
Perform the home abortion with Dexter, then I guess I'll
Dig her fetus out with a wire hanger, then digest her

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

[Verse 2]
All my Westside bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef, and blow it up
Man, I think that he just fell off the deep end, sure enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up
Man, you seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls, so you know who did it
You know you with it, girl, don't front, oh no you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls? Nicole, you kiddin'?
I'll pee on Rihanna, see man, I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room, crazy-gluin' Madonna
To the La-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two, then sit on her
Imagine the visual for that, man, who would've thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick, unleashing his vengeance
But the chick's so old, she looks like she outlived a life sentence
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive, it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

[Verse 3]
Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
Here, you need a hand, big man? Grab hold of this branch
With both hands, man, they don't understand, I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me
Like it's my fault his name rhymes with so many different words, jeez
So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse, please?
"Eminem, I'm coming to kill you (inhale)
Always hated you, and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes, my Superman costume (inhale)
Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you
You're taking this shit too far (inhale)
Who do you think you are? Hang my suit up in the armoire
Every day I hate you more and more, throw down the cardboard
Let's breakdance if you think you're hardcore"

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

[Outro]
The world is mine



[Intro]
Let's just go, man
Is it recording?
Yeah, let's just rhyme out our ass
Bout to kick a rhyme right outta my head
Mic check one two
Mic check one two
Mic check one two

[Verse 1]
Here I go in the place to be, rhyming like this on the M-I-C
Here's the way that I rhyme so naturally, and actually
When I grab the mic, all the people say "M&M, you're one of the funkiest MC's out today
And I say "I agree", because I am a funky dope slamming MC
I slam them back, daddy, eveytime I grab the mic and say I wanna rap, daddy
But you can't, because I take it
Grab the mic and after I'm done, I break it
When I'm done, I just slam the
Microphone and cram it right in your asshole
Because 'asshole' and 'cram the' didn't rhyme, but that's alright 'cause I'm jamming
On the microphone 'cause I'm slamming, busting out lyrics and you like to examine
My style that I'm doing, but if you step to me pursuing, I'll ruin
All your hopes and dreams, 'cause I work with my man, he's on my team
My man Manix is on my side every time the (?) they say
"Damn, how'd you make a beat like that ma'am?"
And I say "I'm not a ma'am, I'm a sir", and if you step to me your eyes'll be blurred

[Bridge]
One two
One two mic check-a one two
One two one two
Mic check-a check one two
Mic check-a one two one two
Mic check three four six seven eight

[Verse 2]
Mic check one two
Do unto others as you would have them do to you
No, that's not the way I work because
When I rhyme I'm a jerk
I grab the mic and start dissing
All these MC's and try to put them into submission
Take them out for the count because the amount I throw is so deaf
Word! Deaf didn't rhyme but I
On your windshield just like a turd
Every time that I rhyme you know that I'm
Going to climb to the tip tip top and I'm
Not going to stop 'cause I grab the mic and dop-da dop dop
I fucked up, but that's alright because my luck's up
No it's not, 'cause here I am, I got a lot to give
And I don't live positive
Now I'm not saying I'm negative
But if I grab the mic I do mega kits
Every time that I grab the mic you know that M&M is gonna be rolling his tongue just like this
And then I go do a funky rhyme and if any MC steps up he gets fucking dissed
Bad, don't call me dad
Vanilla Ice said that, that made me mad
So when I step to the mic
Know that I gotta clear my throat and excite
I'm trying to get the mic cord away from the stereo so I can bust some material
I take it around my leg, and then all the MC's wanna beg
And say "Yo, please give me a turn!"
I say "No" because it's my turn to burn
And I bust a rhyme like this and you can't step to a rhyme that I do 'cause you're dissed!
You're dissed so bad every time
Sure, he don't get a turn, and he's starting to get mad but I'm
Just going to take the mic, I'm not gonna give it to him because I am
So damn hyped in the place to be
Rhyming like this 'cause I'm an MC
Rhyming so deaf to the happy ass beat
It's kinda gay like Liberace but hey
Listen to the words that I display every time I kick a rhyme this way
You know that the star is worthwhile, every time I grab the mic I'm longer than I mile

[Verse 3]
I waste no time, when I can't flip I caper
I cut your butt up like G Floyd like paper
When I bust a rhyme I'm a stud
That's what I like to say, jump on my pud
Girly girly, would you like to fuck me fuck me in my house early?
Or late, I don't care, let's make a date 'cause I don't pump weights to get dates
Just because I'm huge, I bust a lyric
But I get greedy like a Scrooge
When I grab the mic it's kinda stingy
I kick rhymes that ain't dingy
When I bust I'm like forcillin
You try to grab the mic and force it again
But you can't 'cause you are speechless
And I get sandy like teachers
I get sandy, I grab the mic handy
It's so I can get candy
When I bust the shit I get like a noogie
Then I boogie, boogie on down because
Every time that I kick a rhyme I just 'dud'
I meant to say 'do', but I got an addiction to friction every time I kick non-fiction
Non-fiction science, every time I grab the mic I got the alliance
Right behind me stepping into the 90's, you know you'll try me and you'll die, G
So don't even try it, I don't buy it, so you'd better keep quiet
'Cause you're into it, ain't nothing but to do it

[Verse 4]
You'd better catch up 'cause you're trailing
You'd better put springs in your ass and jump like Van Halen
Every (time I bust a) rhyme I get like a panther if you're lying that slander
'Cause you're lying like Berry Saunders, every time I grab the mic I get married and I
Like to kick a rhyme that I pick
Every time I pick the mic up I stick
A dick right up your ass like a faggot
You're gonna die, be crawling with maggots
Every time I dread you like hair, I said you'd better get (?) on your underwear
You'd better run, 'cause if you don't
Afraid you'll be seeing a ghost like a Rake
You ain't an eighth of me, every time I grab the mic girls try to act so faithfully
But I say "No, don't be a fan. Just try to step to my dick and act like a man"
No, that don't make no sense but every time  I cut class like a pair of scissors I get so damn hyped
On the mic, 'cause every time I step to the forefront I like
To wonder on to something that I'm drawn to
Every time I grab the mic and pass it to Sean he
Gets so deaf but I'm not gonna pass it yet
'Cause I burn like acid vet, word!
I'm a stick like a trident 'cause you need guidance



[Verse 1]
Once again, it's the sinister cynical minister Shady
Kryptonite to Superman, he's a dentist to Amy
Administerer of the pain, he just finished huffin' the paint
And muffler fumes like it was nothin', because it ain't
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
His venom he sprays, reaches like beams of energy rays
Menacing stares, he glares, making the hairs
All on the back of ya neck stand like Dracula, yep
Spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan
Yeah, Angela, so I command ya to start dancin'
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical shark
Throwing animal parts at Scarlett Johansson
Enter my gas chamber, you gangsta? My ass
He's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
You're facin' a task greater, he's chasin' your ass
He's got his face in a mask, your blood stains on his glass table

[Verse 2]
I'm checking the exposure of photos of me exposing
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
With or without clothing, next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off, overdosing
Windows opening, shutting; doors opening, closing
I think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and codeine
I was only 'sposed to swallow a half, I took the whole thing
I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink, I'm standing over the sink hosing
Myself, self-loathing, cause I'm on a brink, mostly
I don't wanna think; this will make everything rosy
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toesies
Totally frozen while I close in
I'm yodelling "Rosie, won't you come out to play?"
And no sense wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines
In the papers, making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put Nurofens in my syrup and stirred 'em
You never heard 'em like this, so don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, and lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
Eighty spirits of ladies cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turn of events  that he emerged
Took over the world and reeled in all the children
Lured 'em into the building and killed 'em
Buried 'em in the mulch and mildew and he will do what he feels
And still can spin, straw to gold like Rumplestilskin
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol 3 pills
The Real Slim Shady's entered the buildin'
There's nothing but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch
Mildred, he's ill with it, he still shouldn't be healed
There's no one as sick as he, MC's will get fricassed on the grill, then



[Verse 1]

Mic-Mic-Mic-Microphone...



Due to a massive amount of bootlegging
And constant downloading
People are no longer buying CDs so that we can get paid for our fucking work
They are just continuing to get songs for free
See, what they do is buy computers, strictly pick songs that they like
And burn them on CDs or put them on iPods
Causing major decrease in sound scan, putting music retail in a tremendous slump
Causing artists such as myself to make no money for record sales
Being forced to tour, causing more stress, more arguments with my wife
Not being able to see my kids, drink more, take more pills
Punch more people in the face, hate the world, and end up in rehab!
(sigh) This has been a Public Service Announcement and an excuse to vent by Marshall Mathers
Not that I wouldn't have done the same thing if I could get music for free when I was a kid
But now that I rap for a living, buy my goddamn CDs!
But in the meantime, buy this Obie Trice bootleg from DJ Whoo Kid
And put more money in his pocket
Thanks!



[Intro]
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now. But hey, what'd Daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip! What you cryin' about? You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, LainieUncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (heh)

[Verse 2]
It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bumsee, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Hook 2]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Ha-ha!)



[Instrumental]



[Intro]
Ayo 50
What I tell you?
We ain't even have to say shit, they did it, ha ha

[Chorus]
Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
So let them come to you, the rest'll just follow suit, monkey see, monkey do
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
If they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
Now here they come as we expected, now we just set 'em up
Check-mate, motherfucker, game's over, we won
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum

[Verse]
Doesn't take much for me to raise such a stink up
When motherfuckers hate your guts
You ain't even gotta say much
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
Is like smearing a bloodstain with a paint brush
I cant explain what it is my brain does
But however it works, it's insane, it's plain nuts
And it ain't just my brain thats dangerous
Its a whole combination of things, it takes nuts
And Im not afraid to raise the stakes up
I got a million bucks in the bank and 8 trucks
For anybody who gets on the track and spanks us
I'm patiently waiting for the day, Im anxious
To see the look on ya fake mugs
When you thugs go bankrupt
Ya drunk, you ain't tough
Whatever you drank must've just turned you into some gangstas
This is me talking, motherfucker, this aint drugs
You wanna pop shit? Wake up then make up
Fuck that! Its too late chump, now face up
I pray for the day that someone who spits with the caliber that Nas and Jay does
Opens up his jaw to say somethin' or rattle my name off
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
So I can blow the fucking dust off of this chainsaw
And give him the surgery that he came for
'Til I pull the paint off
I never been shot
But I think me and Fifty must've been cut from the same cloth
'Cause Ive always came off like Ja's chain
When they try to rush him and lost
And came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
I dont stop, only thing that I wait for
Is the day that I ain't gotta report to probate court
'Cause I'ma give you all a reason to hate more
'Cause I been holding my tongue 'til I got a sprained jaw
A lot of rappers on my list that just aint Ja
And I'ma read that motherfucker off come April
You pussies think I went soft 'cause 8 Mile
When I come back Ill be shooting more than just paintballs
Trust me

[Chorus]
Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
So let them come to you, the rest'll just follow suit, monkey see, monkey do
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
If they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
Now here they come as we expected, now we just set 'em up
Check-mate, motherfucker, game's over, we won
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum

[Outro]
Fucking dummies
This aint chess
You playin' motherfucking checkers
This shit is all day, man, its too easy
We playing chess, you playing checkers
You 'bout to get your mother fucking asses jumped
Fucking punks
And by the way
We aint just talking to one person
We talking to every-motherfucking-body who wants to bring it
'Cause we bring it into anybody who wants to bring it
So bring it
Dont pick up the ball if you dont wanna play, man
Its all fucked up now
Fuck Im supposed to do now?
Huh?!
What the fuck I'm supposed to do?!
Yo, we out!



[Intro: Kids' voices + Eminem]
I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America
And to the republic for which it stands
People!
One nation, under God, indivisible
It feels so good to be back!
With liberty and justice for all
Mosh with me now!

[Verse 1]
Scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight and you take it as "I'ma whip someone's ass"
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-taskin'
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
Entrepreneur, who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career, typical manure, moving past that
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack, he's a class act
Rubberband Man  yeah, he just snaps back

[Hook]
Come along, follow me
As I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me
And I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust
As I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gon' fight, we gon' charge, we gon' stomp
We gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors, come on!

[Verse 2]
All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together, let's all form and swarm just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause, no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain  yeah, the wetter the better
They ain't gon' stop us, they can't
We're stronger now more than ever
They tell us "No!" we say "Yeah!" They tell us "Stop!" we say "Go!"
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push shove, mush; fuck Bush!
Until they bring our troops home, come on, just

[Hook]
Come along, follow me
As I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me
And I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust
As I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gon' fight, we gon' charge, we gon' stomp
We gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors, come on!

[Verse 3]
Imagine it pourin', just rainin' down on us
Mosh pits outside the Oval Office
Someone's tryin' to tell us somethin', maybe this is God just
Sayin' we're responsible for this monster, this coward
That we have empowered, this is Bin Laden
Look at his head noddin', how could we allow
Somethin' like this without pumpin' our fists? Now
This is our final hour
Let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times-it, and multiply it by six
-teen million people, all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al-Qaeda through my speech
Let the President answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go
Fight his own war, let him impress Daddy that way
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles
To fight on our own soil, no more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country
We're patronizin' a hero; look in his eyes, it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know whycause I told you to fight!

[Hook]
Come along, follow me
As I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me
And I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust
As I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gon' fight, we gon' charge, we gon' stomp
We gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors, come on!

[Outro]
And as we proceed
To mosh through this desert storm
And these closing statements
If they should argue, let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this weapon of mass destruction
That we call our President, for the present
And mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard
Mr. President! Mr. Senator!

[Hailie Jade]
Can you guys hear us?



[Male Medic]
Mr. Mathers?
Mr. Mathers!
Mr. Mathers...
Mr. Mathers, can you hear my voice?
Okay, he's not responding

[Scratches: DJ Lenn Swann]
"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"
"Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"
"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"
"Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands
The shit is in my hands, here's your lifespan
And for what your life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland
See, I'm a nice man, but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'
Hurry up with the cash, bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin'
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description and sketches ya
Then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
'Cause I got a daughter to feed
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell
And hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' a MAC
Co-operate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin' the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nothin' for her to be smoked
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin', "Freeze!"
But I'm already wanted for sellin' ki's
And a bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit me square in the chest, wasn't wearin' a vest

[Scratches: DJ Lenn Swann]
"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"

"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"
"Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Left the house, pullin' out the drive, backin' out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin' out
Pulled the MAC-10 out
Stuck it in her face: "Shut your yackin' mouth
'Fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp!"
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Figured, "Fuck itmug her while you're there," jacked her up
Stole her car and made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and loft it
Out the window like the girl in Set It Off did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive, but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin', "Johnny, go in and call the police!
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores, the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
And collided with an eighty-year-old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, musta been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped a Beanie Baby
Fuck it, I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin', "truce-truce!"(Don't shoot!)
And surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me, it was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps

[Scratches: DJ Lenn Swann]
"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"

It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, girl
Can you hear that? It's playing our song
Are you sleepy? Take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?

[Verse 1]
You hear the beat as it makes ya not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door; it's locked, so I go to creep
'Round the back with binoculars, not 'cause I wanna peep
But because I'm hungry, she smells like tacos, I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows, all so sweet
With sugar plums; oh, look
Here comes Marshall, he's on your street
He's placing hot, smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em; he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with JonBent Rams'
I guess a modern-day Jack the Ripper is all that I am

[Chorus]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box, my music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?

[Verse 2]
I almost look comatose; who wants to be sober? Gross
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open, I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes, then I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged, I know
I put on my mother's makeup, get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains, but the sun is out?
The devil's upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do? It's locked
I pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig 'til I find it, I wind it up, and the tune just starts
It's playing a song, so beautiful, and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park

[Chorus]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box, my music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?

[Verse 3]
I'm fixated on asphyxiatin' and breakin'
This little chick's neck like a Pixy Stick
The sick, Satan-worshippin' bitches get horse whippings
I'm in the back, through the back door slippin'
Through the crack, leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love, sent from above
Forced entry, the more wenchy the more stingy I become
Been doing this for more than a quarter-century, I'm just numb
Am I dreaming, is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder
I've had enough of the chatter
Climb up to the window, look at her
Then climb in slow to shatter her brain matter and batter her
With a bat; a matter of fact, that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments back to back, like "Tabitha
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula"
Prolonging her plight as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that: cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back the camera
Stand back, 'cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

[Chorus]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box, my music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?



[Intro]
Yeah, ohh, yeah yeah, ohh
I feel like dancing, I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's making me (High)
I said, I smell something in the air that's making me high

[Verse 1]
Okay, here we go, do-re-mi-fa-so, fa-so-la-ti-da-so
Lyrical Roscoe, kick back the Tabasco
You motherfuckers must just not know the tick-tock, so
Time to show you the most kick-ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick-axe, a sick asshole
Tic-tac-toe 'cross your six-pack with X-acto
Knives, stranglin' wives with thick lasso
Big bags of the grass, Zig-Zags, I'm with the Doc, so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison to boys and girls who do not know
You do not wanna try this at home, my lil' vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a six-pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, nor what you thought, so
'Bout time that you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke

[Chorus]
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

[Verse 2]
Your dreams are gettin' fulfilled, ooh, I'm literally gettin' a chill
Spittin' at will, me and Dre have just finished splittin' a pill
You're submittin' to skill, sittin' still
I'm admittin' I'm beginnin' to feel like I don't think anyone's real
Faced with a dilemma: I can be Dalai Lama
And be calm or bring drama, a step beyond of Jeffrey Dahmer
Please don't upset me, mama, you're lookin' sexy, mama
Don't know if it's the lala or the rum and Pepsi, mama
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
How many people you know who can name every serial
Killer who ever existed in a row?
Put 'em in chronological order, beginnin' with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place; from the body, the bag, the zipper
Location of the woods, where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
And which model, which lake they found her in, how they attacked the victim
Say which murder weapon was used to do what in which one
Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife, and which nun
Don't stop, I like this, it's fun, the fuckin' night's just begun

[Chorus]
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

[Verse 3]
When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're tryna light
Behind the board sits Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some
Get behind a LinnDrum, make up a beat and cure the sucker syndrome
The spinnin' drum when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some
Startin' from scratch and then endin' up at the ending of
Capable of winnin' a Pulitzer
So unbelievable, it's a titanium cranium that's full of sur
prises when the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos (High)
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking

[Chorus]
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind



[Intro]
Oh! Yeah! So much for first single on this one

[Verse 1]
Shady's the label, Aftermath is the stable
That the horses come out oferra
Of course we're about to stir up
Some shit thick as Mrs. Buttersworth's syrup
It's the Mr. Picked-on-Christopher-Reeves-just-for-no-reason
Other than tojust to tease him
'Cause he was his biggest (*burp*) fan
He used to be Superman, now I'm pourin'
Liquor on the curb in his name for him
"Eminem, you wait 'til we meet up again, fucker
I'm kickin' your ass for everything you've ever said."
It goes one for the money, two for the fuckin' show
Ready, get set, let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco
Stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street like them buffalo
Soldiers, I told ya I'm 'bout to blow, so look out below, Geronimo
Motherfuckers, it's dominoes, I'm on a roll
Around and around I go
When will I stop? I don't know
Tryin' to pick up where The Eminem Show left off
But I know anything's possible
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game, that shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team I'll get away
With murder: I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today
We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes
In a safe, locked 'em away (*slam*)
Better watch what you say
Just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua
Gosh, I wish I could've told you to not do the same
'Cause one day it could cost you your name

[Chorus]
And this was supposed to be my first single (*burp*)
But I just fucked that off so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka

[Verse 2]
Eri-Eri-Erick swallowed some generic sleeping pills
And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick, bare-naked
Jig-a-jig-ji-ji-Janean just turned 16 and used a fake ID
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee to be so young and nave
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and carefree
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled, they cherish
Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hickory-dickory Dirk Diggler, look at me work wizardry
With these words  am I a jerk or just jerk chicken?
Or chiga-chigga-chig-chig-jer-chig-jer jerkin' your chain
Twenty-two jerks in a jerk circle, or is it a circle jerk?
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'? Allow me to run it back
And rewind it {blblblblblblblb}  wait, let me ask you again
Am I just jerkin' your chain? Am I berserk or insane?
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs workin' the dang
Cameras, filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade
Pornos, who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle
Jigga-ji-just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin videotapes of 'em fuckin'
When they was just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club
And dusted 'em and went straight to The Source with 'em
'Cause they could've sworn someone said, "Ni"
And then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
"Ga-hu" and then they come to
Find out it was Justin sayin', "I'm gonnuh cum!"
And this was supposed to be...

[Chorus]
...my first single (*burp*)
But I just fucked that off so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka

[Verse 3]
Any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'M-A-DICK-SUCKER-I'D-LOVE-TO-SUCK-A-DICK
And if someone picks up
You can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
That I fall out with Dre, wake up gay and make up with Ray (hey!)
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken
Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, big-a-big-cock!
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick, and eat a dick, and stick a dick in your mouth
I'm done, you can fuck off, fuck-a-fuck-off!

[Chorus]
And this was supposed to be my first single (*burp*)
But I just fucked that off so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka (*burp*)



IN PROGRESS



[Eminem]
Ballz, Ballz, Ballz
Ballz, Ballz, Ballz
You'll never touch my

[Hook: Eminem]
Catch me if you can but you ain'tmanenough
You're standing tough
Butyou know that no matter what
You'llnever get the chance to touch
My ballz, ballz, ballz
Ballz, ballz, ballz
You'll never touch my ballz

[Swift]
I see you ain't a player, you ain't balling
And I don't even care who the hell you call in
In this game, it ain't no talking
You can get it started, I nail the coffin
And all I here is "get your man up off him!"
So why I gotta stop it, this nigga was talking
And I ain't gotta prove you nothing
I do it and you ain't gotta push my buttons

[Bizarre]
This dude in front of me, he weighs a brick
He's quick and I can't get Marshall hit (MARSHALL!)
So I played my position and don't make a move
Been doing this for years, my team we can't lose (D12!)
And ain't nobody, ain't nobody hard
9 o'clock, I'm gonna punch me a guard
Hut one, hut two, I'm ready
Hike, give the ball to Nelly
And nobody out there feels me
Take this ball, you have to kill me
And any player in my way, I'm folding
Damn it, caught holding

[Hook]

[Eminem]
Football, Football, I love football
Yes, tres, dos, uno
Dos, tres, fuck, shit, bitch, asshole, son of a bitch
Everybody cuddle, blah I mean huddle
I just stepped in a mud puddle, butthole
Freak, who just tapped on my ass cheek?
Nevermind, let's try quarterback sneak
Cover me, smother me with love that's brotherly
That didn't work, try another play
Hut one, hut two, hut hut, hurry up
I'm reaching up another grown man's butt
Hike the ball, I mean I like Bizarre
But Jesus, he hikes, I think I can feel his balls
My dick is long as it is hard, yeah, so are my balls
It's the longest yard, whoops that's not the chorus
Run it back, wrong song, yeah disregard
That whole statement I just made, what yard line we on?
Our own 5 and our timeouts are gone
Less than a minute left, I just throw my ball
To the sideline to Von, he steps out of bounds
48 seconds left on the clock but every last one counts
Call another huddle, we're down by six
The plan is, to throw the ball to Swift
But he's so god dang high that he trips
Falls and slips, Proof grabs him by his fingertips
And runs the ball all the way down to the one
But he don't get in, but all we need is a put, put.. *mumbles*
But all we need is a touch down and an extra point to win
But then I get sacked all the way back to the ten
God dammit I'mma slap somebody if I get tapped on the ass again
Everybody's laughing now, no timeouts and its now fourth down
We're never gonna make it, wait, I just got an idea
Quick, everybody get naked, Denaun go long
I'mma throw the bomb, c'mon how they gonna tackle you with no pants on
Ass out with a flopping schlong, touchdown! Yeah, I told you
It's the longest yard

[Hook]

[Kuniva]
The new face on the yard, just hand me the ball
I'mma run through all of yall, yall just soft
Even though my cleats is kicking up mud
It's more traction for me, I'm stiff arming punks
High stepping through the end zone
I been grown, I'm so dirty you don't even know my skin tone
It's time to rumble, no time to fumble
And I won't stumble, your frontline will tumble
Playing ball with killers, my team's the realest
Three time offenders, even drug dealers
One of the best running backs there never was
Moving like Barry Sanders, leaving you in the dust

[Proof]
Yak is high, I got the highest yak
Hit the ground so hard I leave tire tracks
Bizarre snap like a fire crack
And my palm more stickier than spider back
Eying my eye, a Mack truck trying to sack us
No matter how big they flying backwards
Wide receiver receiving wide
For every stride in my life, yo, I breathe and die

[Kon Artis]
Defense is playing a pass
Then the quarterback peeps and screams (blue 43)
That means that its time for me
To run out the back like a bat straight outta hell
My tracks burn turf when they excel
I try to lateral pass the ball to Proof
He got dropped and the ball came loose
And shot up like a flare, I gave the ball a stare
And use my lineman's shoulder as a chair
Now I'm flying through the air like a superhero
They can use this pose for a box of cereal
I'm no joke punk, I get my dinerio
For being the best player on my team, what?
As soon as I hear the hut 1, 2, hut
I do one run, run, the screen go run run
Then I cut, spin around in the endzone (touchdown!)
Then I do the ninety shuffle so

[Hook]

[Eminem]
Footballs
I'm talking about footballs, dude



[Intro: Mark Avery]
Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old. Fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store. But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart and suddenly his conscience comes into play

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Alright stop, now before you walk in the door
Of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your mothafuckin' conscience!

[Eminem]
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money and run to one of your Aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades

[Dr. Dre]
Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns!

[Eminem]
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit, are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

[Dr. Dre]
Man don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right!)
Not over this shit, drop the biscuit (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
(You know what Dre, I don't like yo attitude)

[Hook]
These voices, these voices, I hear them
And when they talk, I follow, I follow
I follow, I follow all these voices

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Stan, 21 years old. After meeting a young girl at a rave party, things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom. Once again, his conscience comes into play

[Verse 2: Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
Now listen to me, while you're kissing her cheek
And smearing her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
(Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie, Kids?)
No but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest!
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail

[Hook]

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker. After coming home from a hard day's work, he walks in the door of his trailer park home to find his wife in bed with another man (What the fuck?)

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & (Eminem)]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathing
(Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheating
While you at work she's with some dude trying to get off
Fuck slitting her throat, cut this bitch's head off!)
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
(What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?)
Alright, Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy

[Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
(What you say?) What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
(I'ma kill you, mothafucka!) Uhh-ahh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Coming straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

[Dr. Dre]
Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that, aw fuck it, what am I saying?
Shoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at?



*Television static*
*Eminem begins to snort cocaine*

[Speech: Steve King & Hailie Jade]
Hello, boys and girls! Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships. Do you have a daddy? I'll bet you do!
*Hailie opens the door*
*Eminem snorts cocaine*
Who's your daddy?
Daddy, what are you doing?

[Intro: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
Ha-ha!
Okay then! Everybody, listen up!
I'm goin' to hell! Who's comin' with me?
Somebody, please help him!
I think my dad's gone crazy!

[Verse 1: Eminem, Hailie Jade & Dr. Dre]
There's no mountain I can't climb
There's no tower too high, no plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you
To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?
(Rahhnnn!) Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls
I cut 'em off and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed sunglasses
With Elton John's name on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off
(Suck it, Marshall!) So tell Laura and her husband to back off
'Fore I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
And launch one of these Russians, and that's all
Blow every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
(*Knocking*) Hailie, tell 'em, baby! (My dad's lost it!)

[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
It's like my mother always told me:
"Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and codeine and
Goddamn it, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say, then don't say nothin'!"
Uh Fuck that shit, bitch!
Eat a motherfuckin' dick, chew on a prick
And lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfuckin' gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch
Eat pussy and have pussy lips glued to my face
With a clit ring in my nose, than quit bringin' my flows
Quit givin' me my ammo; can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.
I wouldn't have to go eenee-meenee-meini-mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man, I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal anymore? (Dad!)

[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
At the same time, can make you dry your eyes
With the same rhyme, see, what you're seein'
Is a genius at work, which to me isn't work
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first, cause when I speak
It's tongue-in-cheek, I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums
Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as "Bump and Grind" comes on
More pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade
Standin' on Ronnie's grave, screamin' at the sky
'Til clouds gather; it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
9 millimeter heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

[Outro: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
Crazy
Ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha-ha
You're funny, Daddy!



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yeah, look
If I were to rap about the crap that's out
That's the route you probably want me to take
Cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
Hear my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin' about Paul Wall
You'd probably crap in your pants, cause I'm white and he's white
So he's like my competition, I mean, right?
Nope! Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba
So b-b-b-b-b-b, but I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep, it's awesome
I'm like a sleepin' giant, and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
And sink my teeth in 'em, and fill 'em
Full of poison, and make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em
And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em
And smack 'em with the backward E, the Eminem emblem
I was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face him
Tell him why, look him dead in the eye, then waste him
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
Then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
For this rap game and it g-g-goes
One-two-three, chk-chk, one-two-three
Chk-chk, one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers: "Come nearer!"

[Chorus: Eminem]
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

[Verse 2: Eminem]
"Shady, I know you're in there somewhere, come here!
Talk to me, sit! Here, pull up a chair!
Why don't you cut your hair?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Dye it back, come on, try it!"
Ahh, no! I told you, leave me the fuck alone, will you?
"But I'm here to rebuild you,"  but I already killed you!
"But Shady, we were meant for each other
Think about your mother,"  yeah, so what of her?
"You think about what she did to you and your little brother
All them foster homes,"  fuck you, motherfucker!
I had you beat!  "No, I was playin' possum
Remember? I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time, your soul's mine
I'm taking it back,"  you fuckin' bitch, why?!
"Because I love you, look a little closer
Isn't that us on that poster? Ha-ha-ha-ha!"

[Chorus: Eminem]
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
"Shady, listen! (Shady!) You hear that?
They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back!"
But I don't want it back  "Yes, you do,"  no, I don't
"Yes, you do! You're gonna regret it later,"  no, I won't
"I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the Doctor"
Go ahead, I already talked to Dre yesterday
"Well, I got him on the phone right now!"
(Slim!) You're lying! (Yo, Slim!) How, why now?
What up, Dre? (Check this out, Slim, I gotta talk to you
I don't know, it just seems like ever since you got off your
Drugs you became a lot softer)
But Dre, all that Shady is, is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
(Well, just think about it, Slim, I'm here
Just hit me back and let me know what's up)  fuck this mirror!
"I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you
Let me guide you,"  fuck you! Die, you son of a bitch!
"Put the gun down!"  bye-bye! Boom!
Okay, I'm still alive,  "So am I too!
You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to
Ha-ha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?
You remember that night you prayed to God
You'd give anything to get a record deal? Well, Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life, Marshall, right? Ooh
Look at this house, look at these cars: they're so nice, woo!
Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too?
That you just now seeing the downside to
Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil
Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle
Marshall"  What?!  "No one's gonna love you like I do."
*Chainsaw starting up*

[Chorus: Eminem]
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
(Sayin') I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body (your body, your body, your body, your body)



I don't know what point exactly it started to be a problem, I just remember liking it more and more, whenever people would try to help me I would say get that fucking person outta here, I can't believe they said that shit to me, they don't know anything about me or my life. It's not like I'm out here snorting coke or shooting heroin up my arm.

It's either you have a problem and can you control it or you can't, I literally thought I could control it until I overdosed during Christmas of 2007. Had I got to the hospital about two hours later, I would have died. My organs were shutting down. My liver, kidneys, everything. They were gonna have to put me on dialysis, they didnt think I was gonna make it.

I remember coming out of rehab and relapsing and shooting right back up to where I was when I overdosed. I was ransacking my whole house just looking for a stash of Vicodin that I maybe hidden away and then I found some in my basement wrapped up it was the extra strength ones.

After I got out of rehab I did not sleep for three week straights I mean like not even nodding off for a fucking minute I would just sit up and stare at my TV.

I would walk around my house and thinking every single day, "I'm gonna fucking die." I'm looking at my kids, and like, I need to be here for them. I'm growing. I just couldnt believe that anybody could be naturally happy or naturally function or be just enjoying life in general without being on something

The doctors told me I'd done the equivalent of four bags of heroin,
I was addicted Valium, Ambien, the numbers got so high I didn't even know what I was taking anymore. It never once hit me that drug addiction runs in my family, now that I understand that Im an addict, I definitely have compassion for my mother. I get it now.

I wanted to make an overall statement  Im back. It was a slow process. You gotta remember I hadnt recorded a song sober in seven years. So it took me a while to even feel like I could record a song sober  I dont know the last time I shot a video sober, without drinking or taking anything. Its been years.

I almost feel like a little kid again with rap, I wanna play around with different flows. If I dont feel like its what Im fully capable of, if theres one weak line, I wanna change it. Rap was my drug It used to get me high and then it stopped getting me high. Then I had to resort to other things to make me feel that. Now raps getting me high again.

So I would say to anybody, it does get better, you know. It just does.



[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 1]
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date (Ooh)
Susan, an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin'
Who love booze and alternative music (What up?)
Told me she was going back into usin' again (Nah)
I said, "Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze and the gin
C'mere, let's go in here, who's in the den?"
"It's me and Kelly!"
"My bad" (Sorry)
"Let's try another room"
"I don't trust you"
"Shut up, slut, chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, butt-naked, and run in the woods"
"Oh hell, I might as well try 'em, this party is so drab"
"Oh dag" (Mmm)
"I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag"
"Huh?"

[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (I'm sorry)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 2]
"Yo, Sue"
"Get away from me, I don't know you"
"Oh shoot, she's trippin'"
"I need to go puke" (Blehh)
"I wasn't tryna turn this into somethin' major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop crying, I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped ya
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out (Nah)"
She said, "Help me, I think I'm havin' a seizure"
I said, "I'm high too, bitch, quit grabbin' my T-shirt (Let go)
Would you calm down? You're startin' to scare me"
She said, "I'm 26 years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook"
"(Hello) I'm over here, Sue (Hi)
You're talking to the plant, look
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
'Cause I never seen no one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate"

[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl (Whoops)
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (It's an accident)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 3]
"Susan, wait, where you goin'? You better be careful"
"Leave me alone, dad, I'm sick of gettin' my hair pulled"
"I'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors
'Fore you do something dumb
I'll be right back, just chill, baby, please?
I gotta go find Dave, he's the one who gave me these
(I'ma kill him)
John, where's Dave at? Before I bash you"
"He's in the bathroom, I think he's takin' a crap, dude"
"Dave, pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants, choppin' her hair off
And there's only two days left of Spring Break
How long do these things take to wear off?"
"Well, it depends on how many you had"
"I took three, she ate the other 22 caps
Now she's upstairs cryin' out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol"
"She's gonna die, dude"
"I know and it's my fault"
"Oh my God"

[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world (I'm sorry)
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (What do I do?)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Outro]
My God, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Susan, please wake up, please
Please wake up, what are you doing?!
You're not dead, you're not dead
I know you're not dead
Wake up, Susan, wake up
Oh my God



[G] Eminem as Susan (the girl)
[D] Eminem as Dave
[J] Eminem as John
[R] Eminem as Ron

[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 1]
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and *tied* up
With first aid tape and *raped* on the first date
Susan -- an ex-manic depressive who just moved from Houston
Who loves blues and alternative music (Whattup?)
Told me she was starvin, I said it wasn't a problem (Nah!)
I got a coupon for this pizza with everything on it
We can double the mushrooms and minus the sausage
[G] I'm allergic to fungus
Come on Sue, that's nonsense
Who's at the door? Pizza man!
Who ordered pizza? Susan, it's yours
[G] Nuh uh
If you got it with double mushrooms on it then I don't want it
Shutup Susan I'll pick em off it
Oh hell, I might as well try it, I'll be alright
Susan you just swallowed the wrong slice!!

[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (I'm sorry)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 2]
"Yo Sue!"
[G] Get away from me, I don't know you
Oh shoot, she's tripping..
[G] I need to go puke!! (Bleahh!)
I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major
I just wanted to make you appreciate flavor
Susan, stop cryin, I don't hate ya
I'm sorry your father used to chase ya and spank ya with hangers
So what they locked you in the attic in your dad's house?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out
She said
[G] Help me I think I'm havin a seizure!
I said, "You're breaking out in hives, let go of the pizza!"
"Would you put it down you're startin to scare me"
She said
[G] I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook
(Hello!) I'm over here Sue, (hi) you're talkin to the plant, look!
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
'Cause I never seen no-one eat as many *shrooms* as you ate

[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl (Whoops)
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (It's an accident)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 3]
Susan (wait!) Where you goin? You better be careful
[G] Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of gettin my hair pulled
I'm not your dad, quit tryin to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors, 'fore you do somethin dumb
I'll be right back just chill baby please?
I gotta go find Dave he majored in allergies
"John, where's Dave at before I bash you?"
[J] He's in the bathroom; I think he's takin a crap dude!
"Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talkin to plants
Choppin her hair off, and there's only two days left
Of Spring Break, how long do these things take to wear off?"
[D] Well it depends on how many pieces she ate
Just one, with double mushrooms by mistake
Now she's upstairs cryin out her eyeballs, breaking out in hives"
[D] She's gonna die dude
"I know and it's my fault!"
[D] My god!!!

[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world (I'm sorry)
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (What do I do?)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Outro]
My God, I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry! Susan please wake up!
Please! Please wake up!! What are you doing?!
You're not dead!! You're NOT dead!
I know you're not dead!



[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay
Alright, a'ight, a'ight, a'ight, a'ight
Yo, yo
Alright, I'ma lay the chorus first
Here we go now

[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

[Verse 1]
My mom, my mom, I know you're probably tired
Of hearin' 'bout my mom, oh-ho, whoa-ho
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on Va-aliu-um
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank, fuckin' peas in my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So every day I'd have at least three stomachaches
Now tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an undera-fuckin'-chiever?
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin' either
"What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fuckin' seat for?"
"Mrs. Mathers, your son has been huffin' ether
Either that or the motherfucker's been puffin' reefer"
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
It was neither, I was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a teacup? Bitch, you ain't my keeper, I'm sleepin'
What the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for?
Slut, you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin'
Go find you a white crayon and color a fuckin' zebra

[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner
"You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I?
Now here's a plate full of painkillers, now just wait
'Til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
You little motherfucker, I'll make you sit there and make
That retarded fuckin' face without even tastin' it
You better lick the fuckin' plate, you ain't wastin' it
Put your face in it 'fore I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't givin' in, you're gonna just sit there
In one fuckin' place, finnickin' 'til next Thanksgiving
And if you still ain't finished it I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent?
A rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support, your father, he ain't sent the shit
And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business, kid"

[Bridge 1]
My mom
There's no one else quite like my mom
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on

[Chorus]
'Cause my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

[Bridge 2]
My mom loved Valium, now all I am
Is a party animal, I am what I am
But I'm strong to the finish with me Valium spinach
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it
I can't even write a rhyme without you in it
My Valium, my Vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohh

[Verse 3]
Man, I never thought that I could ever be
A drug addict, naw, fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually what has ended up happenin'
A tragedy, the fuckin' past ended up catchin' me
And it's probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb, Mom, beautiful
She killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache
"Here, want a snack? You hungry, you fuckin' brat?
Look at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap, eat it"
But I don't need it  "Well fuck it then, break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up"
Alright Ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'
I'll do it, pop it, gobble it and start wobblin'
Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip, then I fall in bed
With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead

[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

[Outro]
My mom, I'm just like her
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my momma
Me momma, I like-a da momma
Haha, sorry Mom
I still love you though

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady, you a basehead" (Uh-uh)
"Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted"
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg"
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?

Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?

Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends"
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?

My English teacher wanted to have sex in junior high
The only problem was, my English teacher was a guy
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (OW!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, killin' pedestrians, rapin' lesbians

Uh-uh! "So why's your face red? Man, you wasted!"
Well, since age twelve I felt like a caged elf
Who stayed to himself in one space, chasing his tail
Got ticked off and ripped Pamela Lee's lips off
Kissed 'em and said "I ain't know silicone was supposed to be this soft!"
I'm about to pass out and crash, and fall in the grass
Faster than the fat man who sat down too fast

Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Served the bartender, then walked out with the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship
While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more *** than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper

Hi, my name is, huh?
My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady

[Intro]
Excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class for one second?

[Verse 1]
Hi kids, do you like violence?
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids?
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is?
My brain's dead weight
I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
And Dr. Dre said
"Slim Shady, you a basehead!"
Uh-uhhh!
"So why's your face red? Man, you wasted!"
Well, since age twelve I felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut
"Shady wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!"
I don't give a fuck
God sent me to piss the world off

[Verse 2]
My English teacher wanted to have sex in junior high
The only problem was, my English teacher was a guy
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, killin' pedestrians, rapin' lesbians
While they're screaming, "Let's just be friends!"
99 percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
So I signed it: "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away!
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, my palms too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
I'm steaming mad and by the way, when you see my dad
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

[Hook]

Where'd everybody go?

Because I feel

Yes I feel

Yes I feel, I feel fine, I feel fine
Yes I feel, I feel fine

New time again, dis a new time again
For de time now, de dodge a man him come through and then

'Cause this hear time dodge a no work for satan
Lord have mercy

You know what?

My breath is bad
But my beer is stout
So take my hand and let us jump about
'Cause we got nothing to complain about
The sky is grey
I think it's gonna rain
But that's okay
'Cause hell, I like the rain
So join me here in this here refrain
And shut your shit
And don't complain
What?
'Cause we got nothing to complain about
And you got nothing to complain about
So c'mon
It ain't that difficult to figure out
That we've got nothing to complain about
So c'mon

A man a shot upon him, life through the dark
When you check it out, it's a natural fact
Jah jah have good judgement when you do all you want
And if...

You can speak of babylon while you're around me
'Cause every single little thing I see astounds me
Rainshine...

Inna this time, me no fight 'gainst no man
Me no want no man come try to test dodge
'Cause when you check it out and go upon one mission
And God and the Father and me inspiration
Me test upon a mission and a one-way plan
Me no want no man try disrespect me fashion
'Cause when you check it out and put inspiration
And that is how a you go reach Mount Zion

I feel magical, mystical, motherful, logistical

Lord have his mercy

Magical, mystical, motherful, logistical

Look around X3
On the ground X2
There's a finger on my blister



[Verse 1: Eminem]
My name is Eminem

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
No! It's not your name, your name is Marshall Mathers, asshole



[Intro]
This motherfucker, man!
Just won't shut up, will you?
Talking 'bout I owe him
Bitch, you owe me!
I'm promotin' you right now
Yo, let's put the nail in this coffin!

[Hook]
I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap (nope)
And old men have heart attacks
And I don't wanna be responsible for that
So, put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity

[Verse]
I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino
An 83-year-old fake Pacino
So how can he hold me over some balcony without
Blowing his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me?
Please don'tyou'll probably fall with me
And our asses'll both be history
But then again you'd finally get your wish
Cause you'll be all over the street, like 50 Cent
Fuckin' punk pussy! Fuck you, chump!
Give me a one-on-one, see if I don't fuck you up
Tried to jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up
And you put Jada on a track, that's how much you suck
Dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin'
You sit behind a fuckin' desk at The Source butt-kissin'
And beggin' motherfuckers for guest appearances
And you can't even get the clearances
'Cause real lyricists don't even respect you or take you serious
It's not that we don't like youwe hate you, period
Talk about a mid-life crisis, damn
Last week you was shakin' Obie Trice's hand
Now he's a buster? What the fuck's with that?
Get on a track dissin' us, kissin' 50's ass
And askin' me what I know about indictments, bite me!
Bitch, I got two cases and probationfight me!
What do I know about standin' in front of a judge like a man
Ready to take whatever sentence he hands?
What you know about your wife slicin' her wrists
Right in front of the only thing that you have in this world
A little girl?
And I put that on her, when this is all over
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
I don't know shit about no choppin' rocks
But what you know about Hip Hop Shops rockin' spots
Where you the only white boy up in that bitch just rippin'?
Pressin' up your own fliers and your stickers, stickin'
Them bitches up after spendin' six hours at Kinko's
Just makin' copies of your covers of cassette singles
To sell them out of the trunk of your Tracer
Spendin' your whole paychecks at Disc Makers
What you know about being bullied over half your life?
Oh, that's right, you should know what that's like
You're half white; Vanilla Ice, spill the beans and rice
I'm eatin' you alive inside, Jesus Christ!
If you're that much of a gangsta, put the mic down!
You should be out killin' motherfuckers right now
Kill a motherfucker dead, kill him dead, bitch!
Shoot 'em in the fuckin' headgo ahead, bitch!
Slap my mom! Slap the fuck out of her!
She can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of ya
Cause you're broke as fuck, you suck, you're a fuckin' joke
If you was really sellin' coke, well, then what the fuck
You stop for, dummy? If you slew some crack
You'd make a lot more money than you do from rap
You'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
You'll never know what it's like to be rich
Life's a bitch, ain't it? Raymond?
Here, let me break the shit down in layman's
Terms for you, just to make sure that you can understand it and
Canibus ain't using too many complicated fuckin' words for you
Here, let me slow it down for you
So that you could understand if I say it slower
Let it go, dog, it's over

[Hook]
I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear they grandfather rap (nope)
And old men have heart attacks
And I don't wanna be responsible for that
So, put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity

[Outro]
Haha talking 'bout I have motherfuckers callin' your crib
Bitch, you ain't even got a fuckin' crib!
You ain't even got a fuckin' phone fuckin' bum!
Threatenin' to shut me down at your lil' fuckin' Source magazine, if I come back on you and attack you
Bitch, you attacked me first!
Take it like a man, and shut the fuck up!
And fuck your little magazine too!
I don't need your little fuckin' magazine
I got XXL's number anyways
And y'all can't stand it, cause they gettin' bigger than y'all
Oh, and by the way, how'd I look on the VMA's?
When you was watchin' me
From whatever fuckin' TV you was watchin' me from
From Boston the mean streets of Boston
Fuckin' sissy! And you got us scared up in here, motherfucker
Suck our motherfuckin' dicks!
Oh! And for those that don't know
Don't get it twisted, y'all: The Source has a white owner!



[Verse 1: P!nk]
You're drunk, the carpet is burned
I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home and clean up your mess
What would you do without that?
Why do I always come back?
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you!

[Chorus: P!nk]
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

[Verse 2: P!nk & Eminem]
Some nights I want to run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile is as rare as it comes
What would I do without that?
Maybe that's why I come back
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you!

[Chorus: P!nk]
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Startin' to think we were made for each other
But one of us in this relationship is raisin' the other
You remind me of my mother
We drive one another crazy as each other
And we're both adults, so there's no excuse
For the games that we play with each other
Where you at? At a friend's? No, you ain't, mothafucker!
But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver when I touch her
'Cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
How her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble
She's in hot water, think I caught her cheatin' again
Give her another chance? Another one after that?
I'm swimmin' in that Egyptian river, 'cause I'm in denial
Say I don't eat shit, but I got a shit-eatin' grin when I smile
Makin' an excuse for us to act it out
She's just actin' out with her inner child
Then I set the truth on fire
'Cause I'd rather believe a lie
Then I breathe a sigh of relief, I don't believe in
Goin' to bed mad, I keep on tryin'
To make a bad girl good
But haven't I stood by you in good times?
And bad? I'm startin' to feel like your goddamn dad
'Cause I literally feel like you could die if ever should I
Leave you for good and never would I
It'd be all bad, never understood why they call it goodbye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy
And you're a good person too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep puttin' my fuckin' foot in my mouth
Every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
And I'm in trouble, but I can't leave, I'll sell you out
I could never turn my fuckin' back on youwhat is that?
I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticin' it
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it
I ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart
Our apartment's tore apart
You're usin' my heart for a dartboard
But God must've aligned stars for us
'Cause somebody paired us up
And they say He ain't capable of makin' a mistake
But this one's perfect, 'cause I'm

[Chorus: P!nk]
I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me



[Intro: Eminem and Denaun Porter]
Denaun, what up, man?
What up, dawg?
You all right?
Chillin', cold as hell
Yes, it is. Hey, bus didn't come here, didn't he?
No. Hey look, you got 15 cent?
Nah, I got just enough to get on the bus, I'm broke
We gotta go to the store. Alright, man?
Quick, cause I'm short
Yeah, we gonna have enough time to go to the store?
Nah, look
You should just, how much you got there?
I only got 75, I'm sure I got a dollar, know what I mean?
Just throw it in there, they ain't gonna know. You know what? Ayy look, I'm sick of takin' this damn bus everywhere, man
You gotta make some moves or somethin'
I know, look, I'm tryna get rich
I got a baby on the way, I don't even got a car. You know what I'm sayin'?
I still stay with my moms, 21 and still with my moms
Yeah, look, hey, we gotta make some hit records or somethin', you know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause I'm tired of bein' broke

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern
And dream of havin' a turn to earn money to burn
Mappin' out my strategies to get rich, huh
My desire is like a scratch that needs to get itched, huh
'Cause, man, I live in the D, this shit ain't given for free
Nothin' is different to me, so what else is there to see?
I'll be the prisoner to flee from all of this misery
I'm not wishin' to be another fish in the sea
But just an MC, so listen to me for this and agree
You're missin' the key, you ain't even in the vicinity
Unconditionally, my aspects to cash checks
My objects were never to swab decks
It's up to you, the decision is yours
If what you vision is tours, or a missionless course
When your shit is in the stores, 'cause you can be a star

[Hook: Eminem]
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue, huh

[Interlude: Eminem and Denaun]
Em: You know what I'm sayin'? See what I'm talkin' about, man? Cause that's it. Yeah.
A million dollars ain't even that far away, man.
De: Yo, we got to get the money, man!
I can't be broke for the rest of my life!
Em: Yeah, I hear what your sayin'. Look, there's got to be somethin' better, you know what I'm sayin'?
De: I can't live like this for the rest of my life, man.
Bummin' rides everywhere I go.
Em: Yeah, what's up with Lexus's and Land Cruisers?

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yo, I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handlin' business
I'm cancelin' Christmas to gamble and risk this
Financial interest is the matter at hand
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
I grab what I can and do what I must
Pursue what I lust, it's true that I just
Choose the few that I trust
Them's the people that I still got
Fuck with gangsta Philpot, get your grill shot
The 5 Ela for life: my man Thyme
Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through in the nine
My crew's true and divine, we never fronted
We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
Instead of hunted or bein' wanted as fugitives
It's all about a man plannin' what his future is
What he can do for his to be a star

[Hook: Eminem]
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue, huh

[Outro: Eminem and Denaun]
Em: That's what I'm talkin' about.
I'm not tryna be the player, I'm tryna be the mayor.
I want to be president.
De: Yo, forgot that president, man.
I'm tryna be king, makin' dead presidents.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Gettin' money any time I want, ownin' my own businesses and all that. You know what I'm sayin'?
Em: Yeah, I'm tryna be a millionaire, man.
De: Hahaha, but don't all, you know?
You only live once, '96, baby



[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie
Will have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erased me
I may be a little too fast-paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
Twenty times 'cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
Like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies
And gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die-hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving
To say to me, you had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to about face me
'Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
My flow's untouchable, now you gotta face it
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You gon' say the wrong shit and get your whole face split
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit
Graze it, your peace talk, save it
Your shit sounds dated, you're overrated
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you motherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy  you payin' attention, boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
Shoot it or pop it, roll it, bag it or chop it
It'll get you high over and over, but you gotta cop it
When it's hot, it's hot, your hatin' is undeniable, stop it

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough



[Eminem & Prostitute]
(Hello)
Hi how you doing? (Okay)
Um, who is this? (This is Nicole, who's this?)
Yo this Marshall, how you doing?
(I'm okay honey, but I'm very busy)
(Did you wanna set up an appointment?)
Yeah I actually would, I would like to set up an appointment to get my dick rubbed
(Oh yeah?) Yeah... You know what I mean?
I'm just like... Yo, I'm kinda mellow
You know what I mean? My personality, I'm like real laid back
You know what I mean?
(Yeah, but listen baby why do you have to talk over the phone)
(Is that the only way you can get off?)
(Or do you wanna come in person?)
Uh, I wanna come in person (Okay baby) Alright...
(Why don't you be a man about it and set up an appointment?)
(What time would you like to come?)
Okay, well first of all bitch, you offended me by saying I, I should be a man about it
Cause, yo I'm really, I'm really confident in my sexuality
(Okay, but you know what? A man would just call)
(I, I deal with men all day, they call)
(They call, they make an appointment, they come by)
(And then I deal with little wimps who just wanna get off over the phone)
Right, right, but I'm saying, what-what's you saying
Right I ain't trying to get off over the phone
I'm trying to set up an appointment like a man
(Okay, what time is good for you honey?)
I don't know, if we could do it, like, at 2 o'clock or something like that, you know what I mean?
(You call me when you know for sure baby, I'm very busy)
Alright, alright bitch I'mma call you in a minute, you know what I mean?
(Okay baby, go jerk off your little dick)
Alright bitch



[Verse 1]
In my mind I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
An arsenic writer, author with arth-r-itis
Carpal-tunnel, Marshall with start-shit-itis
Hard-headed and hot-headed
Bull-headed and pig-headed, dick-headed, a prick
A big headache, I'm sick, quick-witted for every lyric spitted
There are six critics who wait for me to slip with it
So quick, this dynamite stick, bury the wick
It's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it, and it's not Nelly
Do not tell me to stop yelling
When I stop selling I'll quit, so stop dwelling!
I am not failing, you fuckers are not ready
Cause I got jelly, like Beyonc's pot belly
This is destiny; yes, money, I'm off running
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening

[Hook]
No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
No apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies!

[Verse 2]
My head hits the pillow, a weeping willow
I can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow
Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows
I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over
These cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough
So keep playing it, and stand next to the subs
I choke mics like asphyxiation
When I'm strangling my own throat masturbatin'
Fuck yeah, I'm a basket case and
I master this rap shit 'til my ass gets wasted
'Til my assassination
'Til I'm slain because of some fag's infatuation
.44 mag's fascination
A taste for disaster, and if that's the case, then

[Hook]
No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
No apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies!

[Verse 3]
This song isn't for you, it's for me
A true MC, it's what he'll do just to see
If he still has it and if his skills mastered
He's able to spill raps long after he's killed, that's a
Real MC, got you feelin' me
Whether willing or unwillingly, you still agree
As long as there's still this hunger and will in me
Then expect a longer life expectancy
I'd be a savage beast If I ain't had this
Outlet to salvage me inside
I'd be exploding, soaked in self-loathing
And mourning, so I'm warning you don't coax me
It's silly, Im really a sheep in wolf's clothing
Who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be
Fooled, the press blows up this whole thing
It's stupid, they don't know, cause they don't see
That I'm wounded, all they did was ballooned it
I'm sick of talkin' about these tattoos Cartoon did
That's why I tuned it out, I'm sick of dukin'
They can suck my dick while I'm pukin'
And you too, you can

[Outro]
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen
It don't even beat, so expect no apologies
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen
It don't even beat, so expect no apologies



[Intro: Haddaway, Eminem, & Lil Wayne]
Love, love
Love, love, love
[Mumbling chorus]
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
Young Money, yeah
No more
Love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & Haddaway]
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "Fuck the world," get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (no love)
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage?
Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (yeah)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (hurt me)
That's right, it don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (love)
You showed me nothing but hate (haha!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (yeah)
And I don't need you (don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
And I don't need you (no more)
Get 'em!

[Verse 2: Eminem, Lil Wayne, & Both]
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
In my whole entire life, I can (yeah)
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
Uh, I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit and I stick it in
I ain't never giving in again (yeah)
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (yeah!)
They call me a freak, 'cause I like to
Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (haha)
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage!
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (oh!)
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (yeah!)
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (yeah!)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (shit)
People just get sick cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (ow!)
And you can never break my stride (nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (uh)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (hurt me)
Yeah, that's right, it don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (love)
You showed me nothing but hate (yeah!)
You ran me into the ground

Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
And I don't need you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)

[Intro/hook: Bizarre]
Yeah ha ha ha (BANG!)
Yeah, Bizarre Kid comin' at you
Eminem and Fuzz and Mr. Swifty, ha ha
No one's iller than me (what?)
No one, no one is iller than me
No one is iller than me
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313

[Verse 1: Swifty McVay]
I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meaning
Got your whole crew doin' subpoenas
Hell nah, you ain't seen a crew, genius
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
Keep it close, you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this
I done made quadriplegics outta these non-rappin' rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape
It ain't no secret that your shit sounds fake
You can't stop it, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
I'm like toothaches: I'm painful to rappers
Then you can tell from these shells
How I gotta bend 'em like root canals
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linking trials
Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates  BLAAAOW!
It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said, no one is iller than me, unnhh

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
Me and Eminem and Mike, drivin' down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason
Should be takin' my medication, it's 9 to 10 I'm facin'
Last week this old man I had to blast
Cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TV's and VCR's is at
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route
Throwin' bombs at day care centers and yell: "Everybody get out!"
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2-piece
Cause she found out I was havin' an affair
With her 10-year-old niece

[Hook: Bizarre]
No one, no one's iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Nobody better test me, cause I don't wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dipped freshly
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth, crack open a six
I'm on my seventh 8-ball, now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was?
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does
They probably don't be packin' anyways  do they, Fuzz?
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted, stab your abdomen
With a hand-crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin' felon, headed to Hell in a handbasket
Talkin' shit'll get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van, wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked
By these fantastic furious four motherfuckers
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grandmasters
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me

[Verse 4: Fuzz Scoota]
I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
Ask the feds if I'm past the edge
Rockin' the most classic threads, flashin' bread
Roll down the window: "Bitch, you got some fantastic legs!"
You can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre, you get him and him
Swift, you get him and him, I'll get him and him
Leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screamin', "Get the cops, quick!"
And got drop kicked, now she screamin', "Stop it!"
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop, bitch, Fuzz Scoota '97 crop pick
Sick of y'all niggas lookin' at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggas still don't know the top pick
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
And have you shittin' socks, bitch
P Rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split
Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits
(No one)  ain't nobody iller than me

[Hook: Bizzare]
It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313

[Outro: Bizzare]
You have now witnessed four ill emcees
From the home of potholes and trash
We'll lyrically blast



[Intro]
Yo, how do I keep
(Man, I don't know whats up with these hoes, man)
Gettin' in relationships like this?
(I'm just sayin)
Maybe it says somethin' about me
(Yeah, yup)
Should I look in the mirror?

[Chorus 1]
I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not 'til she gets her act together

[Verse 1]
She thinks I'm bein mean and now
She starts to scream and shout
Shes about to let the demons out
She don't wanna see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin to leave the house
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how

[Chorus 2]
I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
I guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein weird's normal

[Verse 2]
And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
So much so that I bet you she don't even know that she's
The first thing I think of when I wake up
And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats, so do I, I'm soulless, she's heartless
No wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 911 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause alls it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger
She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep it a hun', we over
Kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the fuck did I get so twisted
Up with someone so unlikable and shifty
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing
She's only mine for the time being
That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she
Tried to two-time me
And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
Into a motherfucking crime scene?
Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't s'posed to agree, you fucking bitch!
'Specially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me to flip, little conceited cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it
Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!
I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hopin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Who the fuck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognize me and had Milo flip me off
Right out the passenger side window
I hit a light pole, you skirt off
And then pull up at 5 a.m. in the drive in a stretched white limo
Stumble in the side door and hit me in the head with Milo's demo
But like a drunk bum, what do I know?
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you you're the apple of my eye, so shut your pie hole

[Outro]
Just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal? (Yeah)
I just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?



[Chorus]
Im not afraid (Im not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
Well walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that youre not alone
Holla if you feel like youve been down the same road

[Intro]
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're tryna get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me
I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a "fuck you" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

[Chorus]
Im not afraid (Im not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
Well walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that youre not alone
Holla if you feel like youve been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
For you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehh"
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

[Chorus]
Im not afraid (Im not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
Well walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that youre not alone
Holla if you feel like youve been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just cant keep livin' this way
So startin' today
Im breakin' out of this cage
Im standin' up, I'ma face my demons
Im mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
Ive had enough, now Im so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm

[Chorus]
Im not afraid (Im not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
Well walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that youre not alone
Holla if you feel like youve been down the same road

I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowin' smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flyin' to a party I am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me
I ain't gotta dance long as my Ferrari Spider move like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons
I'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tires is new
The Maserati white and cool like G-Eazy
Why these dudes tryna figure out
How to do a freestyle as fly as me? (Why?)
I'm confused tryna figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G
Everybody doin' chick joints
Probably rob these little dudes at fist point
'Member everybody used to bite Nickel
Now everybody doin' Bitcoin
We don't got nothin' in common (No!)
We don't got nothin' in common (No!)
Y'all into stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups
On them uppers-and-downers (Woo!)
I'm into stuff like doublin' commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up and then bust the shit down
If the cops hit us up, we can flush the shit down
We cannot give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic
Sellin' your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible couple of dollars, you powder sniff
Now you slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics
Y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless
If you've got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Hirin' strippers, prostitutes retirin'
We can spit it for ya advance
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in Prince pants
You niggas

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Brain dead, eye drops
Pain meds, cyclops
Daybed, iPod
"May-back", Maybach
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Payless, high-tops
K-Fed, iHop
Playtex, icebox

[Chorus: Eminem]
That's how much we have in common (Yah!)
That's how much we have in common (Whoa!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (Yah)
That's how much we have in common (Yuh!)
That's how much we have in common (Woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's nada like us

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You say you're affiliated with murderers, killas (Ayy!)
The people you run with are thuggin' (Gang!)
But you just a wannabe gunna (Gang!)
Like you was gonna do somethin'
Actin' like you catchin' bodies (Ayy!)
And you got juice, lil' youngin', you buggin'
You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery
Bitch, you ain't plugged into nothin'
Rap God spit lyrical bullets (Pew!)
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with muscular
But have guns for sure, you better put a
Strap on, other words if you're gonna
Roll up with your (Gang!) you're gon' need a arsenal
'Cause this bar is over your head
So you better have arms if you're gonna pull up (Skrrt!)
Oh, you run the streets, huh?
Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?
This little cock-sucker, he must be feelin' himself
He wants to keep up his tough demeanour
So he does a feature, decides to team up with N9na
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne
If you wanna come at me with a sub, Machine Gun
And I'm talkin' to you
But you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling you motherfuckers
But just in case you forgot really and need Ja memories
Jarred like strawberry or pineapple, apricot jelly
I respond rarely, but this time Shady 'bout to sound off
Like a fuckin' cocked semi-Glock demi-god
Let me put a fuckin' silencer on this little
Non-threatening blond fairy cornball takin' shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rock Steady Crew
Obviously, I'm not gettin' through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, lettin' off like Remy Ma
Heavy artillery, Godzilla, harsh with a hard shell
With a motherfucking heart bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say I lost
You'll be talkin' 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off
And you better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OGs, R.I.P. Prodigy
Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me
That I'll be the most hated, though made it
So that there's no shame, it's okay to own it
'Cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho
But now those days are over
I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hanging open
My code name is groper, I role play with lotion
I fuck the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
Old lederhosen with home-made explosives
I blow 80 holes in you
Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows and
I'm insult to injury, Rolaids to Goldman
I'm throat spray and Motrin, I throated Nicole
As they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'
I double-edge sword it 'cause one place I poke and
I stick and I turn in a rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal
I'm fuckin' these syllables, I let 'em lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick
A little bit unpredictable, I spit the formidable
That you bitches fuckin' with, the original
I consider me and Nickel identicalbut not us
The only thing we have in common is I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
None come close to skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older
Sponge, mug, folder, nun, rug, holster
Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster
Young Thug poster, unplugged toaster!

[Chorus: Eminem]
That's how much we have in common (Yah!)
That's how much we have in common (Whoa!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (Yah)
That's how much we have in common (Yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (Woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's nada like us
(Man, fuck this shit, let's go)



[Chorus: Kehlani]
Ashes blowin' in the air
Our worlds on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and were never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold
Fuck doin' what you're told
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
This road is takin me back
Down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
Im simply stating a fact
I had Wembley Stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
Another terrorist attacks
Like a tariff, blows half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish in the blast
But that isnt scaring us, we pass
Nowhere we're fearless, 'cause we're just

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]
Ashes blowin in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give ano, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Fuck doin' what you're told, act like a two-year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow
Anyways; for MC's it's a funeral
When I'm devisin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto, guts, bravado
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
'Cause some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothin' although
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow
But if at times my heart it seems
Like it's in the wrong place, it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves speed of life, avoid or veer
Or just steer toward it, we're only lookin' forward
But where we're goin', we have no idea
Nowhere to go, but hysterical, it's gettin' warm in here
I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitchwar machine
But you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have somethin' for your rear
And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe
Go to war with me, you'll end up blew to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up ruinin' your career
But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run I'll just rewind clocks, forever young
Make time stop, will I ever fall off? That day will never come
'Til the pine box, bitch, fuck you! I'm better than I ever was
'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does
But I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top, so everyone's just

[Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]
Ashes blowin' in the air (so we're)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give ano, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast

[Bridge: Eminem & Kehlani]
You can't tell us nothin'
Hard-headed and we're stubborn
So, one ear and out the other when we're young, we're young
(We're on the run of our lives)
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter? Uh oh
(We're on the run of our lives)
No more tomorrows, we're done
And all we are is

[Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]
Ashes blowin' in the air (so we're)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care (don't care, yeah)

'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sandy Hook, Stoneman Douglas
Another lone-wolf gunman
Sometimes I don't know what this
World has come to, it's blowin' up
And this whole country is goin' nuts
And the NRA is in our way
They're responsible for this whole production
They hold the strings to control the puppets
And they threaten to take away donor bucks
So they know the government won't do nothin'
And no one's budgin', gun owners' clutchin'
Their loaded weapons
They love their guns more than our children
Shhh, think another one just entered in our buildin'
And we'll be

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Ashes blowin' in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah

[Intro]
Aye, Em
Yeah

[Chorus]
So, Slim Shady, to the stage, please
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
You know what you doin' when you do it for the ladies
So, ladies, this ain't the place to be in if you're lazy (Get up!)
I said, "Shady, to the stage please"
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
You know what you doin' when you do it for the ladies
So won't you please step up to the mic, baby?

[Verse 1]
It's been a little boring lately
I've been playing in poison ivy and pee
I've been itching to get in some S-H-I-T
You heard what I S-A-I-D
This club? I guess they I.D.
But they just let me in without it, so I guess they like me
I put on my best dang white tee for the season's festivities
And I even got it pressed and dry-cleaned
It's me and the rest of my heathens, we in the building
'Til it closes, we're partying 'til then nobody knows that I'm drinking
Keep my Bacardi concealed inside of my jacket
When no one's looking, I tap the bottle, crack it, then swig it then put the frigging top back on it and cap it
Yeah, that same bullshit, man, I just got back on it, god dammit
Boy, you don't want it, doggone it, that gin and tonic, I slam it
An alcoholic, I am what I am, that's all that I am
And upon my further inspection, Monica's bra I examine
And if you're wondering why I'm looking in awe as I am
It's 'cause I'm just so overjoyed to see people brawl to my jam
And now let's go

[Chorus]
So, Slim Shady, to the stage please
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
If you know what you doin', fellas, turn to the ladies
And tell 'em, "You just the hit the lottery, baby"
I said, "Shady, to the stage please"
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
We heard the fellas, now let's hear it from the ladies
Say, "You just the hit the fucking lottery, baby"

[Verse 2]
Man, I hate it when no one's paying me any attention
So I won't let up 'til they do, I don't have any intention
Ma, I like your breast, but your booty's too skinny to pinch it
How is that possible with a waist on me about 26 inches?
Ease up on the Henny, just sip it
There's so many winches up in here that's got my interest
I'm drenched in sweat down in the trenches
Continue to make my way all the way to the center of the dance floor I've just entered
Hope that I don't get injured, oh, here I go
I'm shaking my tail for the oh-so member
Oh, feet, don't fail me now
Better be nimble when you swoop this bimb' up
Get the info on the nympho dudes went for 'cause of the way he pimped up
Shady's Mercedes Benz with the crazy rims got the ladies trembling
Like a gremlin with a head full of Red Bull at 12:15 AM and
Dude, I feel incredible, is medicine edible? You are unforgettable
Girl, the fact we didn't meet sooner is the only thing that I think's regrettable
Let me check my schedule (Shit)
Oh no, your phone number ain't even legible, this night's unmeasurable
It'd be my pleasure to introduce you to

[Chorus]
Slim Shady, to the stage please
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
If you know what you doin', fellas, turn to the ladies
And tell 'em, "You just the hit the lottery, baby"
I said, "Shady, to the stage please"
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
We heard the fellas, now let's hear it from the ladies
Say, "You just the hit the fucking lottery, baby"

[Verse 3]
So when you come in the club, don't care if you paid or you snuck in
Soon as you hear the beat drop, stop what you doing, start buckin'
So get up like you're up and, homie, get down like you're ducking
Up like you're stuck in the air and down like you're down on your luck
And not down like out, so just turn that frown upside down that you're stuck in
There's no upside when you're down
The only downside when you're up is being hungover
So, Shady, won't tell you 'em what's up?
Then go get your cup and refill it
Now speed it up a little bit and just kill it
Don't stand there and look at my whip, chick, get in
I ain't gotta tell you again, now close the door, you're lettin' flies in
What? Am I supposed to be air conditioning the whole outside then?
Would you look at what you're riding in?
You better take pride and stare at it for five minutes
You're lucky I didn't just drive by in it
You're privileged just to be inside of it
I stepped in this party to liven it
I just caught a vibe in it the minute that I arrived in it
So, ladies, where you at? Make some noise if you're likin' it
Then tell your boyfriend to take a hike again
Two Heinekens and you're mine
So, Slim Shady, won't you please step to the mic again? (Come on)

[Chorus]
So, Slim Shady, to the stage please
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
If you know what you doin', fellas, turn to the ladies
And tell 'em, "You just the hit the lottery, baby"
I said, "Shady, to the stage please"
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
We heard the fellas, now let's hear it from the ladies
Say, "You just the hit the fucking lottery, baby"



Detroit

There is a resilience that rises from somewhere deep within your streets

You can't define it, but you can feel it

You can feel it overflowing from the people who call you home

From people who are always proud to declare, 'I'm from Detroit'

You took our country from it's infancy, into industry

And your name still carries with it the idea of a nation built on steel, muscle and sweat

You became the city that carried the country

The city, like the sport, is built on dreams

People who arrived here, driven to excel

Who know nothing is accomplished without hardwork, without sacrifice

When you hurt, we hurt

Your streets witness our struggle

Your bricks are our rage through the emptiness of each house shuttered, of each factory closed

We've lived through the ups and the downs

But we remain, Detroit

We can never turn our backs on you Detroit, because we are you

My home

The home of Motown, Cadillac and Joe Louis

Through all this, we cannot be defeated, because we have never been defeated

You've built us, you've moved us, you've shaped us

Sometimes down, but never out

Take strength in us, your people

Stay up Detroit



[Verse 1: Eminem]
You claim if you get knocked by the cops
You'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment
Shoot the bailiff, karate kick the plaintiff
Gotti with the stainless
I'll just call it shoddy entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lame
Your hobby isnt robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawin' them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description
Ain't nobody dippin'
Out the back of the club like, "Oh my God, he's trippin'!"
Only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
I need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing, I'm still coppin' a feel
Like Bill Cosby at will, poppin' a pill
Then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggy
This blonde fuck's reprehensible
Misconducts, never sensible
Kiss my butt, my set of principles
Is gone, but 'til I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And send it to Mitch McConnell
Just as big of a bitch as Donaldshit's on, bruh! (Ha-ha)
Let me sing this shit soprano
While I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff-arm her while I'm hittin' on Melania
And this song's for all ya

[Chorus: Eminem & Kent Jones]
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

[Verse 2: Eminem & Paul Rosenberg]
These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam
I'm gettin' handies with the zanny Xannys in the Caddy armrest
I'm imaginin' objects
So I'm battin' cobwebs from a daddy longleg
In Hamtramck, got the panoramic camera
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice her age and I'm actin' half it (Ha-ha)
Grow up? Nah, not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul
Got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin' all through those Klonopins like a bowlin' ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol
And go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to
An interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal
You're so appalled (Em), so's my manager
Bitch, I am mature, fuck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close so don't compare
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me'cause I don't own a mirror!
But, Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits, whiff it
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these rape lines
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
Bang, bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives're butcher than gay wives
You're gonna need sutures the same size
As the blade I push into caput'cha
When I pull 'em like (What?) sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times to make it on Dateline
I came to stake my claim like a canine waitin' in a buffet line
So, Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre
Come play, belly dance on me
I've been makin' wedding plans all day

[Chorus: Eminem & Kent Jones]
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Eight-year-old with the wordplay
Girl, take this pole like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape, 'cause you're in a slurrin' state
Im a ten, youre an eight
Like what I do before, after, and durin' rape!
You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
And be made a fool out of when I pull on 'em?
R. Kelly with a full bladder
Non-high school grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold when I'm droppin' knowledge
My degrees is the same as I got in college (Zero)
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
I owe you nada like Haloti, partner
Blow me, told you I'm so dirty, homie
You can throw me in some holy water
With some floaties on and get the soap and try to
Get the Pope to hold me while you hose me off
And nope, I won't be washed
Hope to God I don't explode
I gotta blow this spot up though, I got a lotta mo'
I won't put the sugar coating on it though
'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone (Uh-huh)
I get why you're tapped
"But you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire, get upset and fire back!"
Is what I tell myself when times get bad
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
But I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie when life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad: don't cry, get mad!
'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
I'm right in your ass (Sodomy!)
Foot up it, I stood up for the kid
Who had to put up with the bullies at his school (At his school)
You ain't had to have no money
Or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude (Attitude)
Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain
That's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish
I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it, then I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage
But it's embedded in my head I never
Hunted for the bread and butter
What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but
I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood
I put up in the pen, and when I'm dead I wonder
Will they put me on a pedestal
Or forget I was ever this incredible?
I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause
I'll never get another motherfuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this, I can simply because I can

[Chorus: Eminem & Kent Jones]
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds



[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, play that shit
What the fuck you doing Stretch
Gotta stretch your neck
You better protect it
Imma Inspectah Deck
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ho, ho

[Verse 1]
Paul Wheres my words at
Yo see Slim Shady yo, where the birds at
Being flipped the middle ones
Rappers get these little ones in they mouth
These little nuts, yeah
Shit, I dont care I aint afraid to admit it
I got a little dick yeah, but so do you
You scared to admit it
You wont spit it on this mother friggen mic
Cause I will strike and smack your ass like a friggen fag
And I dont care if you get offended
I never pretended to rock this microphone beef
You wanna start it now well end it
Cause when I slip in the zone up on this microphone
People want me to do a written rap but fuck that go home
I dont really give a damn Ill kick right off of the top
And everything that I drop always gonna remain hot
Let on the spot, Slim, I mean woops, Grim its when im dim
Yo, Im in affect mode
Rappers get they neck sewed
Get they whole threshold fucked up
Get they damn fleshed sewed
Ha, ha
I busted, I kill it, I crush it, I do it, the fluid, I spill it, Im ill wit
These motherfucking rhymes that I be coming with and running with and kick you in yo motherfucking stomach with bitch
Cause you dont want none of it
Rappers always try but they always die
And rappers always look to me and tried to lie
(Arf, Arf)
Yo, where my dogs at
Yo (err, ribbit) where my frogs at
In the house, It really doesnt matter cause I still turn it out
When I step on this mic, smacking your spouse
Ha, Ha
The illest MC to come off the top
When I get this drum off
Yo Strech give me a break, let me catch my friggen breath
And till` the death, bust rhymes till` theres none left
Im wanted for theft and robbery
And probably smack a bitch up in the lobby G
Cause she dont want none of me
Im the illest MC to ever hold a cordless on the planet earth and youll see
That Im from the friggen D
Yall dont get my point Im from Detroit
Smoke your fake ass like a joint
Thats the first simplest rhyme I ever said in my life
But, at the end of the night Ill still be fucking your wife
Shit, I really dont care your style needs to switch
Cause you aint rich, thats why you aint rich
Remain underground, cant come off the top
You cant drop rhymes nonstop like this
I might twist my friggen dick up in your ear
Rappers always wanna stand clear
Im a motherfucking landmine
Yall dont understand mine
Im Slim Shady showing out like my tan line
Ha, ha
The illest MC to rhyme
Every time the illest MC of our time
I rhyme time and time twice but Im nice
With this mic device I slice right through your Adams apple
I had a Snapple and a motherfriggen syringe
Up in the bathroom I shouldnt have but yo I boinked
To any MC up in this shit who want some
To any MC who wanna step up and get some
Get done, fuck competition
Let me catch my breath one more time
Yo, Im on a mission
To stomp any MC comp I just trunked
And swamp is this truamp a word?, no its not
Yo, but here I go with this lyrical, lyricols, spiritual flows, that I flow so hysterical
Driving MCs crazy, Slim Shady, up in your motherfucking radio baby



[Intro]
Oh no, what's happening to my brain?
I can't believe this is happening again!

[Verse 1]
Lava on my lips I flips, wake up think I have a cramp
I'm trying to shove the lava lamp up my father's ass
I think I'm out of gas, man, I need another mask
I'd ask my mother but I think she's laughing at the plants
A half a gram of graham crackers and some Van de Kamp's
I think I'll eat some Ambiens like they're candied yams
Cut a couple cadavers up and have a little snack
Abra-fucking-cadabra, motherfucker look who's back
Just like a pendulum, Satan's pentagram swings
I accidentally dented it and bent the damn thing
Shit I think I might have did it when I was dancing
While I was chopping one of my legs off when I pulled a hamstring
First I Re-Up, then I Relapse
Go to rehab and I Detox after I see Doc
And I'll be back with the sequel, repeat the cycle
Cause I react like the She-Hulk when I see NyQuil

[Hook]
Oh no! (Oh no!)
Here we go again (again)
Don't know (don't know)
When it's going to end
Uh, oh! (Uh, oh!)
Where did it begin?
Don't go (don't go)
Maybe way back when
(Relapse!)

[Verse 2]
Into the well, baby Jessica fell, she may have wetted herself
Quit playing, get her some help
Mary Kay Letourneau sending me letters from jail, every day in journals
Saying how, she wanted to smother me in lettuce and mayo
I'm the medicine man, my medical marijuana
Was prescribed by a doctor, shove a typewriter up
Perez Hilton's ass, shit, almost forgot that
He's always shoving something up his ass so why not that?
And fuck it while I'm venting let's shove a vending machine
Up his rear end when he's bending over pretending that he
Didn't say anything that would be offending to me
Stick his head in a blender, begin blending in G
Where should I put the pink sissy with the fluffy hair?
Put him under the stairs? People are already under there
Hmm, I wonder where. Wait, I think the cubpoard's bare
Stuff him up in the Tupperware and shove him up in there

[Hook]
Oh no! (Oh no!)
Here we go again (again)
Don't know (don't know)
When it's going to end
Uh, oh! (Uh, oh!)
Where did it begin?
Don't go (don't go)
Maybe way back when
(Relapse!)

[Verse 3]
Vicodin's like a nitrogen hydrogen vitamin
I bite into five and then I get high as a kite again
I like it when I get in my zone on the mic again
Who am I kidding? I couldn't quit this shit if my life depends
I relapsed twice after I came outta Brighton then
Yeah, rehab's nice, I had my name up in lights again
You see that's why I can't decipher what life I'm in
I might pull a knife on your wife and slice her and dice her then
It sounds so enticing, isn't it nice when I'm hype again?
On nights when I'm like this, no time to write just type it in
If I could get my pen to slow down, what'd I write just then?
Man I'm 'bout to hyperventilate, I just have hypertension
I have the type of mental state you couldn't comprehend
Unusually stupid of you for you to think I'm your friend
I usually do what I do and suffer no consequence
I offer no mercy, the controversy is once again

[Hook]
Oh no! (Oh no!)
Here we go again (again)
Don't know (don't know)
When it's going to end
Uh, oh! (Uh, oh!)
Where did it begin?
Don't go (don't go)
Maybe way back when
(Relapse!)



[Intro: Eminem]
Good evening
This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of
Four million and a half.. feet
That's eight million miles in the sky
Please... undo your seat belt for takeoff [chkk]
You are now free to smoke about the cabin

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I'm Dre, from back in the day
From N.W.A, from black and the gray
From choking a bitch, to smacking her face
From stacking up bodies, to racking AKs up
From racking up hits, to stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry, and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we're what's happenin' in rap entertainment
Me and Shady, as far as competition, faggot, there ain't none

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Speak of the Devil, it's attack of the Rain Man
Chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun, vrrunn, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon? No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one
Wait, it ain't funny, man, it's urgent, I need one
Two boxes of detergent in a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1

[Chorus: Eminem]
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smoking with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smoking with the best)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon Wireless
A nice environment, surprised entirely
Hypnotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants
Taking lives of firemen; say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and Vicodin
Before I begin to get so high, pussy boy, I could spin
Vinn-vinn, fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach, and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some french toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin
Show me nipple, I pinch both, and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse; if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain

[Chorus: Eminem]
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Now where there's smoke, there's fire
Where there's fire, there's flames
Where there's flames, there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Nuh-uh, he ain't playin'
He's gon' get the AK and aim it right at your brain
I'm slightly insane, vodka and creatine
Hpnotiq and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And it's given me wings, I believe I can fly
While I pee on a girl, you won't catch me CSI
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake
Dre, get on the mic and make 'em tremble and shake

[Verse 6: Dr. Dre]
Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your Henny and Coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke 'til there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it, you're smokin' with the triedest and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rollin' shit up
You motherfuckers ain't smokin', you just holdin' shit up
Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
Won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing as how I blew up off of puffing them trees

[Verse 7: Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
Well smoke enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up, Cheech
Come on, smoke me out cuz, give me contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff
But this is Earth calling Shady, man, come on backWhat?
Man, we're losing him, he won't even respond back, fuck!
Now look at all the pretty women in here (Damn, bitches!)
Dre, it's hot, I think we better go check on their temperatures
I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages
Now baby, just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit, just

[Chorus: Eminem]
Give me one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)



[Intro: Eminem & Manix]
Yo man, yo Marsh, man
Yo, you've been kickin' all this shit about yourself
What of the homies, man?
Oh you want one about the posse? Alright

[Chorus: Eminem]
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride

[Verse: Eminem]
Well foolish pride has a lot of things to say
You got foolish pride, like you got tooth decay
But tooth decay is another problem
So let's take this ole foolish pride problem and solve it
Now, when I talk about foolish pride
I mean blacks and whites taking different sides
When blacks and whites take different sides
Unity never happens, and we will subside
We will subside and hatred will release
And everything will just crush that peace
But when we crush that peace, you see we start hatin' each other
But remember, you are my brother, and you are my sister
Just like I'm a mister
I seen a black girlfriend and I kissed her
I kissed her, I placed it on her cheek
And she didn't come back 'til next week
Now it was next week and she was back again
Wanting to kiss a white kid
So she was my girlfriend, we started going out
But that's okay because we were black and white
Blacks and whites sometimes mix
But black girls only want your money 'cause they're dumb chicks
So I'ma say like this
Don't date a black girl, take it as a diss
If you want, but if you don't
I'ma tell you like this, I surely won't
Never date a black girl because blacks only want your money
And that shit ain't funny
So I'ma say look honey
Why do you do this?
You know, you step up to me like you a Brutus
Then you try to grab my spinach
Because it's green and that's cash
So get outta here, 'cause I don't need your ass
I said that before, but that's okay because like I said you're a whore
Black girls and white girls just don't mix
Because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks
White girls are good, I like white girls
I like white girls all over the world
White girls are fine and they blow my mind
And that's why I'm here now telling you this rhyme
'Cause black girls, I really don't like
We don't mix, it's like riding a bike
When you're peddling hard, uphill both ways
You know it's kinda hard and that's why I say to you
I'm giving you a little advice
Don't date a black girl, if you do it once you won't do it twice
You won't ever do it again because they'll take your money
And that ain't funny
So I'ma say, "Look honey"
I thought I said that before
But like I said again you're nothing but a big whore
So when mike catch on the bass line
That's okay cause we will not just waste time
I'll get straight to the point, black girls are bitches
That's why I'ma tell you you better pull up your britches
Cause all that cash is making your ass drag
From the boyfriend you ganked and that's pretty bad
I mean that's pretty sad when you're dating a black guy
And then you turn around and fuck another big black guy
Now that's pretty wrong, but you're just ganking
But that's okay because you need a god damn spanking
From me, the funky M&M
I'm busting rhymes and I'm swallowing phlegm
I'm busting a freestyle just like this
I say "swallowing" phlegm and Howard gets pissed
But when Howard gets pissed that's okay
Because he leaves and he doesn't show up for two more days
So I'll just worry about that problem when I come to it
I'll cross that bridge when I come to it
'Cause I forgot the chorus
But that's okay cause y'all saying bust a rhyme for us
So I'ma bust another rhyme about this black girl
She turned out to be a fuckin' wack girl
A wack girl, because black girls ain't funny
All they want is your goddamn money
They take you for everything you've got
And then you stand with a bunch of snot
In your hand
So I'ma kick it to you just like this
How does the chorus go?
I forgot
But that's okay, 'cause I'ma tell you in stride
I'ma say, "Ole foolish pride"

[Chorus: Eminem]
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh
Date a white girl, 'cause they got the raw hide



[Intro: Fatt Father]
I told y'all motherfuckers I was coming back (oh shit)
What now nigga? What now? What? Brewster Projects nigga

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club
And I'm trying to run and get my motherfucking gun
(Nigga what about yo' wife?) Nigga fuck my wife
I'm trying to run and save my motherfucking life
Oh, shit! The shooter's coming
Bitches hollering, niggas running
People, shot all over the floor
And I'm trying to make it to the Saint Andrew's door
(Hey man) ...That's the sound of the Glock
Even DJ House Shoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around, and forgot my TEC
I don't see nobody, but Fatt Father and Hex

[Verse 2: Kuniva & (Eminem)]
(Kuniva, you alright?) These niggas is tripping
(Where's Bizarre at?) (I don't know, man)
I'm trying to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screaming everywhere and niggas is wylin'
Two minutes ago we was all joking and smiling
This chick is clinging on to me, sobbing and sighing
Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she crying
But it's real and it's on and caps is getting peeled
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield and
She got hit and now she's yelling (Don't leave me!)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me!
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38 I hope it's not too late!

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 3: Swift & (Kon Artis)]
(I been trying to call you all day motherfucker where you at?)
I'm on 7 Mile...what the fuck was that?
Damn, somebody hit me from the back!
(What with? They car?) With a gat nigga, and my tire flat
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?) I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi (Shit, that's the clique we beefing with)
Man! (I swear) And I was on my way there
Believe me, I'm leaving a carcass today
And I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up!

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleeping outside the door, waiting in line still
Trying to get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshals know the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd
Fans and some cum-wad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of them off
Missed who he's aiming for, six feet aways the door
Into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flying all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar, having a mazeltov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah I guess not, what the fuck? Oh my God, it was!
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him hauling ass, I think he left his wife
There she is, on the ground, being trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her
God damn, there just went another damn bullet
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
It's too thin, if I get hit again I can't do it
I scoop Dee, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it and
Made it to the front door and collapsed
On the steps looked up and I seen Swift
Shooting it out but I can't see who he's shooting it out with
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezing his four-fifth

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Yo, it's Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass on my left, hand Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for trying to check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck
That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show
The third's for the bartender (bitch bring me a bottle of Mo')
I just wanna know who driving the black Mitsubishi?
He tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off



[Intro]
You know, critics, man
Critics never got nothin' nice to say, man
You know, the one thing I notice about critics, man
Is critics never ask me how my day went
Well, I'ma tell 'em

[Verse 1]
Augh, yesterday my dog died
I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said: "Next time you blog, try to spit a flow."
You wanna criticize, dog? Try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole
I'm fired up, so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter, here I go
Flows tighter, hot-headed as Ghost Rider
Cold-hearted as Spider-Man throwing a spider in the snow
So you better get lower than Florida
Inside of a lowrider with no tires, in a hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes?
Listen, dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf, this is a blistering assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt, so get lost
Shit, dissin' me is just like pissin' off the Wizard of Oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze
Beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers, gizzards, and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him, and visit his dog

[Chorus]
(You're on fire) That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold
(You're on fire) Man, I'm so fuckin' sick
I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit
(You're on fire) You need to stop, drop, and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow
(You're on fire)
(You're on fire)

[Verse 2]
I just put a bullshit hook in between two long-ass verses
If you mistook this for a song, look, this ain't a song
It's a warning to Brooke Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over, so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
I'm lightning in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan
I pop up, you bitches scatter like hot grease splashing a fan
Mr. Mathers is the man, yeah, I'm pissed
But I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man
Turn him into plastic
So for you to think that you could stand a fuckin' chance is asinine
Yeah, ask Denaun, man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon
Fuck it, I ain't playin', pull up in a van
And hop out on a homeless man holding a sign sayin'
"Vietnam vet", I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can, beat his ass, and leave him nine grand
So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute
You wanna get graphic, we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke
On a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop
Sayin' you sick, quit playin', you prick, don't nobody care
And why the fuck am I yellin' at air
I ain't even talkin' to no one, 'cause ain't nobody there
And nobody will fuckin' test me
'Cause these hoes won't even dare
I'm wasting punchlines, but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Nah, don't waste it, save it, psychoyeah
Plus you got to rewrite those lines
That you said about Michael's hair (Woops!)

[Chorus]
(You're on fire) That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold
(You're on fire) Man, I'm so hot
My motherfuckin' firetruck's on fire, homie
(You're on fire) You need to stop, drop, and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow
(You're on fire) Yeah
(You're on fire)



[Produced by Mr. Porter]

[Intro]
Hey yo, what's up, man?
Hey yo, you been here all day, man
Y'all been here every weekend, man
I don't ever get a chance to rap first, man!
That's 'cause you wack!
What?!? I ain't wack, nigga, I got some raps for all y'all
Nigga, my raps fresh, I'ma bust my raps first
You can bust yours after me if you want to
No, no, man, I'm goin' first
I'm gettin' tired of everybody wantin' to go first, man
You always rap first, I'm rappin'
I don't care what none of y'all say; I'm fresh, I'm fresh

[Hook: Thyme]
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Man, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, I wanna know"
I said who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, I wanna know"

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'll have you taken back to Christ when you're sacrificed
The way you're hacked and sliced
When I fill your back with knives
Jackin' life's of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowin' up the stage with illegal contraband
I stomped your man, so unless you want what he got
You better set the mic down, I'm steamin' like a teapot
I make the D hot, people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
It's an amazin' task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
And win a slug fest, I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry like a sorcerer, no remorse for you
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicin' up an enemy's appendages 'til he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when he's through with his verse
I'm all covered in flea bites
You wanna see fights, I got a match for ya
You couldn't flip shit playin' in toilets with a spatula

[Hook: Thyme]
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Man, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, I wanna know"
I said who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, I wanna know"

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespectin' me
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a TEC to me
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
Inferior, deterior rate, like bacteria
Materially, killin' serially, clearly you'll see
How much in fear when you hear me you'll be
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme and feel your jaw get stiffer and ache
Wither and break, you slitherin' snake
Gibberin' fake, fibber and flake
I'll twist you in a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake
If this is a dream, you wish you can wake
Every diss you can take, personal
We ain't friends tryin' to make amends
If you ain't ever stole a gate you can take offense
I make intense masterpieces
And smash to pieces your last releases
You pass diseases, that's the reason
I'm showin' you the proper way to
Operate a mic, so pass it like a hot potato
I've never been less than clever and fresh
Severin' flesh of fools who never impressed ever infest

[Hook: Thyme]
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Man, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, I wanna know"
I said who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, I wanna know"

[Outro: Thyme]
Whhhooo the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?!
Point him out! I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, I wanna know"
(Ayo, let me get that mic, man)
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic?!
Who the fuck passed you the mic?!
(I got the rhymes, bitch, I'll kick that shit)



[Kuniva]
Check my vocals, 'cause you know what I'm about
It's best to play like O.J. Simpson and I just stab out
Why did you enter? You didn't comprehend
See this is a battle for MCs who think they might win
But fuck the battle, let's take it to the streets
'Cause you a pussy, oh well, if you are what you eat
Now you can go get your crew ? you now
? me wrong ? and all this shit gon be blew out
Claiming you jumped out bitch
Nigga we bust in the bitch, you talk more shit than Reggie Miller
Never spent nothing more, nothing less
The first single that you drop is "I wanna be fresh"

[Eminem]
Any rapper sayin' those kind of rhymes
In this day and age, in this period of time
Trying to battle Eminem is worse than David Starr
Trying to battle Proof, Eye-Kyu, B-Flat and Bizarre
? that's why you beg to differ me
You ain't got no style plus you lack delivery
Not to brag, I don't mean to boast
Look, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost
You're that bitch, you couldn't slip up in the zone
If I put banana peels around this fucking microphone
So get a bull dozer, start from bottom to top
And take this building down 'cause that's the only way you're wrecking shop



[Intro: Eminem]
Here's the story, of a little boy
Growing up in a suburban home
Trying to cope with everyday life
Who lives in a little house
That was built, in the middle of the street

[Verse 1: Eminem]
"Hey, Mom! 2Pac's on the jukebox"
"So what, he shot two cops
And raped a little girl while two dudes watched"
"Nuh-uh! They were tryin' to frame him"
"You and that Tupack Shaker..."
"No! That ain't how you say his name, mom!
You're so lame, don't you know anything?"
"Yeah! I know that you'll probably go and join in a gang,"
"Yeah, right. I'm out. Where's my fuckin' Walkman at?"
"Stop cussin' at me!"
"Shut up, bitch!"
"Quit talking Black!"
Well, slammed the door and I'm out
Now, what? It's probably warm in the house
Fuck, I forgot my jacket, forgot it was winter
I'm gettin' thinner, I'm hungry
Is Mom cookin' dinner?
"Mom! Let me back in! I forgot my coat
Mom, come on, I'm not playin', it's cold!
Alright, sorry, I need a jacket
Mom, look, my 2Pac tape, I just cracked it
Ma, please let me back in
It is Tupack Shaker, I just asked him"
I'm freezin', I'm sneezin'
I'm breathin' too much cold air, I'm wheezin'
"I ain't did nothin' I didn't say 'I'm leavin'"
I said "I'm goin' on the front porch to get somethin'"
(scissors cutting) "Alright, here take your damn coat and leave,"
"Fine, I'll le Mom, you cut off the sleeves!"

[Hook: Fred Durst]
Our house
In the middle of the street

[Verse 2: Eminem]
One, two, three
My teacher's two-faced, went to lower all my school grades
Since last Tuesday I had a toothache from Kool-Aid
So Mom kicked me out, and all I had in my suitcase
Was one shoelace, a tube sock, and a tube of toothpaste
Sometimes it was cool cause I could go to Fred's
Crash there, fool around and just skip school
But other times I'd rather just be home
In my own room alone beat my shit and nobody would know
My little brother sucked on a bottle 'til he was six
So I'd hide it inside the couch and say
"I don't know where it is"
But as soon as Mom found it I would either be grounded
Or kicked out of the house a thousand weeks and still countin'
Even when I was underage
Mom was tellin' cops I was tryin' to run away
I told her "Someday, bitch, you're gonna pay"
Please, Mom, please, Mom, please, I wanna stay
(Let me stay)

[Hook: Fred Durst]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My brother's incoherent, Mom's a single parent
Who ain't carin', starin' through me
Like I'm transparent, made it clear
That I was just there to run her errands
Told her friends I was a son from her last marriage
Sent me up to the corner store with a little note
"Please, sell my step-son some cigarettes so I can smoke"
One time I tried to fake sick to get attention
Back-fired, Mom sent me to school with a vengeance
My life's the worst thing that could ever happen to me
I go to class and every teacher's always laughin' at me
And Mom says white rappers are laughed at
Not only that, she heard me upstairs
I can't rap, and I'm stupid
I'll never make it averaging a D+
I need to sit on my ass and sue people like she does
One time, I got food poison from a hot dog
Mom sued and got $2,000 from Ballpark
"Hey, Ma. You got a dollar?"
"I don't think so, now keep an eye on your brother
I'm goin' to bingo."
"But, Mom, you said you were broke."
"Who said? You got your ears messed up
From that damn rap music."

[Hook: Fred Durst]



[Teller]
Don't kill me!

[Eminem]
Hurry the fuck up! 
(Shoots the teller)
Thank you! 
(Running)
Go, go, go! What the... fuck? The fuck did he go?
Mothafucka bail on me? Fuck you! (Car stops working)
Aw, you gotta be fucking kidding me!
Are you fucking kidding me? Shit! 
(Running)
(Climbs a fence)
Get off! 
(Shoots a dog)
Ha-ha! 
(Sirens)
Parking lot! Shit, ah!

[Officer]
Let me see your hands, bend over!

[Eminem]
Ah, fuck it!
(Shoots himself)



Aw yeah
Let's go

(Aw yeah, let's go, take the course check it out.)
My posse
It's my posse yeah
My posse
It's my posse yeah

Many occasions and situations are endangered
My posse has arisen in collision in Vertjas
The outcome is the same as; the remains are never changing
No surprise we specialise in facial re-arranging
'clusion is protrusion using this line as I curb
Plus, damage with advantage we'll step on you like a smurf
Pissing competition with an underdog ambition
Given our position pain inflicts in repetition
Ridicule arrival and survival of a battle
Sequential is essential first intent'n to dismantle
Copulate and demonstrate a form of repercussion
So fasten your mouth 'fo' we start passin' out concussions

My posse
It's my posse, yeah

(Alright now)

Nobody can catch the way that I display the rhymes
I lace those, they just stand and huddled in dismay and say "how the hell did he do that"
But if I told them how, they still would never be able to get the pattern
It's just the wondrous way of one who's working as a new jack
Trying to prove that in order to make you move you take the hyper crew and have the hypest rhymer and then you come up with something what?...hype
Taking the time to demonstrate the rhymes that I create
It's only half the job and I'm working a double shift to make it right
Cause other things that go along with a job like making sure you have a style that's totally different from the others in the Bassmint
Always staying a couple of steps ahead
And even though we're bred to look the same the difference is our styles are separateus

My posse
It's my posse yeah

Oooh it's my posse

Em, what's going on?
This is Paul Rosenberg, your faithful attorney at law
Listen, I listened to the rough copy of your album
And, uh, y'know, I've just got to be honest with you
Can you tone it down a little bit?
Because there's only so much I can explain
Give me a call



[Paul]
Em, whats going on?
Its Paul. Uh
Dre gave me a copy of the new album
And I just*sigh*Fuck it!



Em, it's Paul
Listen, Joel just called me and
He said you're in the fucking back behind his studio
Shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range
I told you not to fucking bring your gun around
Like an idiot, outside of your home
You're gonna get yourself in trouble
Don't bring your gun outside of your home you can't carry it on you
Leave your fuckin' gun at home



Hey Em, it's Paul, uh, listen, I just got a call from the label
And you're probably not gonna be surprised but, um
Michael Jackson is extremely upset about the "Just Lose It" video
And, um, I mean he's pissed, so I don't know what he's gonna do
But we gotta talk about how we're gonna handle this
Um, oh yeah, anyway, somebody told me that, um
They heard a rumor that you got a new gun
Um, I know it's probably not true
But I just need to talk to you about that
So, um, gimme a call



[Paul Rosenberg]
Em? It's Paul
Ah, I just listened to the entire album
You gotta be fucking kidding me
I mean with this Christopher Reeves shit?
You know the guy's dead, right?
And then the whole gay stepfather incest rape thing?
I don't have your back on this one
I can't even fuckin' handle it, I'm done

EMINEM YOU FUCKING BITCH







I



[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, Oh, its impossible
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Verse 1]
Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in a verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself
Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
Into waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, Oh, its impossible
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Verse 2]
Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists and just ball it
Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on 'em like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, Oh, its impossible
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Bridge]
Oh, step into the unknown and find yourself
Youre floating freely, no emotion

[Verse 3]
Got a fuckin mouth with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfuckin' tongue thats how
I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
You're a legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Manage to prove who the best man is
Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standin'
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowin' what it's like to be southpaw
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
Cause I am

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, Oh, its impossible
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal



I'm ice grilling you, staring you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, cause Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac with a cranium packed full of more uranium
Than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spasmodic
Strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in a hospital in critical condition
I flat lined, jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai-weed
Looking Chinese with my knee's, stuck together like Siamese
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope god forgives me for my sins
It probably all depends on if I keep on killing my girlfriends



[Eminem]
Yo yo, back again
Ha-ha-ha (Agh!)
Turn it up a little bit, pick it up pick it up
Yo pick it up, pick it up
Yo pick it up
If you find a phone call in a Tim Westwood line, what the hell you gonna do?
Pick it up! Pick it up!

[Proof]
If your ball falls out with a pad on the floor, what the hell you gonna do? (Pick it up! Pick it up!)

[Eminem]
While I'm smacking up girls to keep the hoes in check
The double S-Slim Shady wreck the London set
Sit back and relax while my squad smokes crack
And tap your man back and be like (Did you see that?)
Ah yes, coming from the mother freaking Midwest
Lift your shirt up and let me see them big breasts
We molest girls three times a day, three times a night
I got G-fulls of criminal peoples
Jumping out when we ten deep
Beat you down and speed off in a Benz Jeep
Brothers be like: Eminem changed his style up!
Shut the hell up, I'm still seven miles slut!
It's '97 so get with it
Peep that back in the day stuff when that Infinite tape was hitting
Listen, must we forget
I originated all that rough shit, that talk drug shit
That left motherfuckers who said our sound like [?]
Detroit city is where I grew up bitch
Peace to all my Outsidaz in Jers
Forget what you heard, this is three and one third

[Proof]
If you got an STD and your penis falls on the floor (What the hell you gonna do?)
Pick it up! Pick it up! (Ahhh yeah yeah yeahhh pick it up, pick it up)
If you see a Slim Shady tape on the fucking rack
What does Dre do? (ooohhhh)
(On the uckin rack, on the uck without the f)

[Eminem]
I get deaf MCees stepped to the left
I bust MCees and my name is Wyclef
How you doing? I play the banjo, piano whatever it is I rock like Barry Manilow
Yo it's Slim Shady on the freaking deck
Y'all don't check it out I wreck the Frim Shady set
The Frim Shady is what I said because I'm freaking drunk

Aggressive dialect with aggressive sober pitch

From miles around they can feel us lethal

Me recipe to be with this don't even test MCees
Y'all can't get with us it's the dress, dress on ya



[Verse 1: Chaos Kid]
Get up this morning, I'm feeling sleepy as hell
Went to use the bathroom when I tripped and I fell
All the way downstairs onto the couch
And I pissed my pants on the way down south
So I went back upstairs to change my underwear
Took a while to get em unstuck from my pubic hair
Finally got unzipped I went to put em down the street
But then I threw em in the garbage cause it all said pew
Hopped in the shower put shampoo in my hair
Went to rinse it out but then the water wasn't there
That damn toilet it must of went foul
Got another bath to wipe the stuff up with the towel
Went to get my clothes but I couldn't wear the wash
So I sat and played some Mario on my Nintendo
I was gonna see my girl but I forget that stuff man today
I just feel like a pooh butt...

[Hook-2x]
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I'm just feeling like a pooh butt today

[Verse 2: Chaos Kid]
Now every single day I make habits to get up
But today I just feel like a pooh butt so ill stay in bed
I dont know whats wrong with me, I'm just taking everything nonchalantly
I just feel like I can't move one muscle
My girlfriend calls me up and tells me now we gotta hustle
My plane leaves to roll about quarter to 8
It's 7:15 looks like I'm gonna be late
Aww forget that baby said I just can't make it
I know you're disappointed but your gonna have to take it
I'm sick in bed I'm making [?] foot it but before hung up the phone she told me where I could put it
Comes next day I got a call from M&M he said
(We gotta make a record get ya butt outta bed) I said I ain't doin nothing I wish you nothing but luck he said (What's up?) I said I feel like a pooh but...

[Hook]
Sometimes things just never go my way you know i, im just feelin like a pooh butt today

[Break]
(Chaos Kid) "yo you ever have one of those poohie stinky ridiculous rotten days, M&M" (M&M) "man I had one once check this out"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Woke up, 6:30 in the morning, yawning
Gotta get to the recording studio
I gotta get a take done
Put all my rhymes together so I can make one
Get outta bed, fall on my head
Slipped on the rug, I thought I was dead
Cussin', I think my head is busted but it's really nothing
Only a concussion, shake it off, get off the ground
Look around couldn't find my rhyme sheets; Where'd I put em down?
They were just there last night on the chair
Had to look everywhere but couldn't find em anywhere
Go to the basement might of misplaced em
Gotta find em in hurry but my visions still blurry
Goin' down the stairs what could happen next
But, when its this early you can't skip steps;
Fallin head first -- As I fall, I curse
Things are lookin' bad, I'mma only get worse;
Aching I shake and I hurt I stand up slowly
Wiped all the dirt off memory lapse
I can't remember nothing, think I'll collapse
If you forget the whole thing pause for a second
What was I looking for? Oh yeah, my rhyme sheets
They might be on the floor or on the chair
Wait a minute where am I? I'm in a basement
Damn, how does time fly? Think for a second
Record my memory if I were a rhyme sheet where would I be??
Now I remember I put em in the closet next to my jacket
So I woulda never lost em
Already seven, I've only got an hour to eat breakfast
Get dressed, plus take a shower got undressed
Got the zest off the rack
Turn the water on and I almost had a heart attack;
Cold as hell, started to yell jumped out the shower
And said fuck it, I'll smell
Grabbed the towel off the rack, dried off got dressed
Still had to eat but my hair was a mess
I was in a rush, grabbed the brush
And ran into the door on the floor I land
Always to fate now; I know I'm cursed
I think it might help if I open the door first
Tried to turn the handle but I sprained my wrist
But that's what happens on a day like this...

[Hook]
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I'm just feelin' like a pooh butt today

[Break]
(Chaos Kid): Wow, that sounds pretty poohie to me

(M&M): Now, I'm gonna break it downfor those who don't know what a pooh butt day is

[Outro: Eminem]
Now, a pooh butt day is something everybody's had
No particular depression neither mad or sad
You couldn't see your butt because your butt is what it is
Cause when your feeling like a pooh butt
Then you're feeling like shit



[Intro]
Hello, what up? Hello?
Yo, I can't, I can't hear you
Let me call you right back

[Verse]
I sense someone's tappin' into my phones, why do
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon?
The FBI might be tryin' to pull my file soon
I might be walkin' blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seein' rockets light up the night sky
Right outside the window of my living room
And if they do, you can say good night
And bye-bye to them my tunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
The plan is to have as many in the can as I can
As I stand before you in this booth a walking-dead man
Blank stare, dead pan, look on my face
As I gaze into space, as I wait to be scooped up in that van
As I mysteriously disappear into thin air
And they gonna say a sniper just appeared outta nowhere
And I'll go down in the history as the bloodsuckin' leech
Who hid behind the freedom of speech
Tried to take the 5th Amendment, use it, twist it and bend it
And ended up dyin' the villain, not the hero, splendid
Stupendous way to end this
I can feel the tremors tremendous
In remembrance of September 11th
Flashback to September 7th
When 2Pac was murdered in Vegas
He said it, he predicted his own death, let us never forget it
Should we ever live to regret it
Like the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated in broad day
By the crazed lunatic with a gun
Who just happened to work on the same block
In the library book depository
Where the President would go for a little Friday stroll
Shots fired from the grassy knoll
But they don't know, or do they?
Who's they for them to say "touch"?
We're all vulnerable and it's spook-ay
This is about as kook-ay as I've ever felt now
Count down to nuclear meltdown
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
You can run, you can do what you want to
But you know you ain't gonna do nothin'
When it's time, it's your time, you are the prime target
You have become Public Enemy number one

[Intro]
*Eminem pukes into the toilet*
*Eminem hocks and spits into the toilet*
*Toilet flush*
There I go, thinking of you again

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Verse 1]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song, whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of
Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it, I'ma start right here, I'll just be brief, I'm
'Bout to rattle off some of the reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now I'm sitting here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim (Shi-i-i-i-i-i-it)
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfucking thing you've ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you (Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-hoo)

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Verse 2]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter that you'd probably just shred up, yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece of
Paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fucking hate you in a freestyle
You're a fucking cokehead slut, I hope you fucking die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fucking guts, you fucking slut, I hope you die (Di-i-i-i-i-i-ie)
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yack (A-a-a-a-a-a-ack)
But what else can I do? I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I wanna do is pu-u-u-u-u-u-uke

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Outro]
*Eminem pukes into the toilet*

Ah, damn!
Fucking bitch



[Part I: Quitter]

[Intro 1: Eminem]
Yo, I dedicate to this to you
To all my fans, keeping y'all in health
Let's tell this Whitey Ford to go fuck himself
Cause it's cruel when you cause a bad heart condition and
Which I create, cause that's my mission
So listen close, to what we say
Because this type of fag claims to never be gay

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I knew you was jealous from the day that I met you
I upset you, cause I get respect, I bet you
I'm even liked better by your niece and nephew
And now you hate Fred because Lethal left you
Peckerwood mad cause his record went wood
No respect in the hood, fled to his neck of the woods
Got in touch with his roots, found the redneck in his blood
And said, "Heck, country western rap records are good"
So he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes
He can't rap, or sing, but he wants to do both
Puts an album out and rules for part of the year
Then Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit come from out of nowhere
It's the start of an era, rock rap's harder this year
No one's tryin to hear some fucking old fart in a chair
Sittin on stage, strummin acoustic guitar in your ear
So you start to get scared, sit back and spark an idea
Figure you can diss me to jump start your career
I punch you in your fucking chest 'til your heart kicks in gear
And fuck your underground buddies' nameless crew
Like I'mma say they names so they can be famous too

[Chorus 1: Eminem]
You just a Quitter and you bitter cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'mma kill you, I'mma kill you
You just a quitter and you bitter cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'mma kill you, I'mma kill you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Heart attack to stroke from the crack you smoke
To the rap you wrote, your fuckin' answer back's a joke
And I'mma tell these motherfuckin' fans the truth
The reason why you dissed me first and I answered you
You said I passed you in a lobby and I glanced at you
Like I ain't notice you, bitch, I had a show to do
Like I'm supposed to be star-struck, come over to you
You better shut your fuckin mouth while you oh-for-two
Back in '94 Limp opened the show for you
Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you
Took your motherfuckin' DJ and stole him too
So you fall in a slump and get all emotional
So now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings
Confused as fuck cause now your music sucks dick
Mr.-Mr. Ass Kisser to get accepted in rap quicker
But never last, and Everlast is a

[Chorus: Eminem]
Quitter and you bitter cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'mma kill you, I'mma kill you
You just a quitter and you bitter cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'mma kill you, I'mma kill you

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Aight look, so this is what we ask of our fans
If you ever see Everlast, whoop his ass
Hit him with sticks, bricks, rocks, throw shit at him
Kick him, spit on him, treat him like a ho, bitch-slap him
Do it for me, do it for Fred, do it for Limp
Do it for Rock, do it for rap, do it for Kid
Do it for Ice-T, do it just to do it, fuck it
He's a bitch, he ain't gon' hit you back, he's nothin
Shit in five years we'll all be eatin' at Whitey's
And he'll be bussin tables in that bitch, cleanin the toilets

[Interlude 1: Eminem]
Ayo, fuck this, cut this shit off
Ayo Head
That's why I fucked your mother you fat motherfucker

[Part II: Hit 'Em Up (Remix)]

[Intro 2: Eminem]
Kill Whitey (hahaha!)
Kill Whitey, Detroit
Kill Whitey, yo, yo
Kill Whitey, haha, look

[Verse 4: Eminem]
First off, fuck your songs and the shit you say
Diss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay
You claim to be a Muslim but you Irish White
So fuck you fat boy, drop the mic, let's fight
Plus I punch you in the chest, weak hearts I rip
Whitey Ford, 40 and white, lethargic ass dickhead
I keep 'em comin while you runnin' out of breath
Steady duckin' while I'm punchin' at your chest, you need to rest
Dilated, go ask your people how I leave ya
With your three CDs nobody sees, when they released
Evidence, don't fuck around with real MCs
You ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks
I let you faggots know it's on for life
But Everlast might die tonight, haha!
Fat boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and take a heart pill, you know

[Chorus 2: Eminem]
Grab .380s when you see Slim Shady
Call the doctor to heal your heart
They shocked you back to life at the clinic
But you 'bout to get relapsed any minute, honkey, I hit 'em up

[Interlude 2: Eminem]
Hahaha, yo check this out
You faggots ain't even on my level
I'mma let D12 ride on you bitch-made ass faggots

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Yo, get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Whitey Ford's heart just stopped
Eminem shocked him back, he had another heart attack
Whitey Ford's gettin his ass floored for talkin' back
Little faggot Hamburgular, I show you where the burgers are
At your own restaurant, while I'm servin' ya
Drop and stomp your whole heart 'til it stops
Call the cops, I'mma beat your ass while they watch

[Verse 6: Kuniva]
Ha ha, now we got the whole industry makin fun of you Erik
Where's your House of Pain now? It's only one of you Erik
You a petty coward, you ain't ready to steady go a round
With some killers from 7 Mile to the muhfuckin' Belle Isle Bridge

[Chorus 2: Eminem]
Grab .380s when you see Slim Shady
Call the doctor to heal your heart
They shocked you back to life at the clinic
But you 'bout to get relapsed any minute, honkey, I hit 'em up

[Verse 7: Eminem]
Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still
This ain't no freestyle battle Everlast gettin' killed
With his chest open, tryin to throw a fuckin' punch
But you just chokin', having a stroke
And now you learn why crackers never earned a dime
Cause you suck, motherfucker you should learn to rhyme
Talkin' about you packin' pistols but it's funny to me
You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me
I'm a paleface killer whale
On his way to fuckin' prison, pistol whippin' tail
Erik, remember when I passed you in the lobby that day?
That shit was obvious, you probably was gay
Now it's all about country, you gave up hip-hop
49,000 copies the week your shit drop
While my sales making records break
2.5 million scanned by the second week
Motherfucker I hit em up

[Verse 8: Proof]
I'm from Detroit's Pemberton Ave where bullets tear you in half
Fuck the music, we got a Uzi for all you fags
Get the shit out of our stereo, Dilated, you violated
Now you 'bout to get annihilated, we gon' bury you
Erik's irons get choked up and yoked up
All you underground bitches get your throats cut

[Verse 9: Swifty]
What the fuck, is you stupid? I choke Whitey Ford
With his fucking guitar cord and stuff him in cardboard
Chopped up in a box, with sixteen parts, I stomped on his heart
D-12, Amityville, fuck your mother while you watch
Keep your restaurant locked and block your door
Cause we hit 'em up like motherfuckin 2Pac Shakur

[Verse 10: Eminem]
You a, Black Jesus, heart attack, seizures
Too many cheeseburgers McDonald's Big Mac greases
White devil, washed up honkey
Mixed up cracker who crossed over to country

[Outro: Eminem]
Yo, ayo cut this shit off
Sheeeit! Fuck him!
That's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm done
That's it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I promise
I just believe in kicking a man while he's down
Goddamn! I quit!
Mention my daughter's name in a song again, you fucking punk Ayo!



[Verse]
Some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits
My life's like one great big ball of shit
If I could just put it all into all I spit
Instead of always trying to swallow it
Instead of staring at this wall and shit
While I sit, writer's block, sick of all this shit
Can't call it, shit, all I know is I'm about to hit the wall
If I have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it
I ain't dealing with another fucking politic
I'm like a skillet bubbling until it filters up
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it building up
Blow this building up, I've concealed enough
My cup runneth over, I done filled it up
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts
Well, I'ma show you what, you gon' feel my rush
You don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch
Peel the Dutch, I'm about to tear shit up
Goosebumps, yeah, I'ma make your hair sit up
Yeah, sit up, I'ma tell you who I be
I'ma make you hate me 'cause you ain't me
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see
What you closed-minded fucks were too blind to see
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee
Out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me
You need peace of mind? Here's a piece of mine
All I need's a line
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme
To express how I'm really feeling at that time
Yeah, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
It's just sometimes, it's always me
How dark can these hallways be?
The clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half-past three
This half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece of paper
[rip] I'm desperate at my desk
If I can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
Stuck in a slump, can't think of nothin'
Fuck, I'm stumped up, wait, here comes somethin'
[crumples paper] Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out
New pad, crinkle it up, and throw the shit out
I'm fizzlin' now, thought I figured it out
Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid?
Why am I a slave to this trade? Cyanide I spit to the grave
Real enough to rile you up
Want me to flip it, I can rip it any style you want
I'm a switch hitter bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter
I'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a
Fucking boiling point, put some oil in your joints
Flip the coin, bitch, come get destroyed
An MC's worst dream, I make 'em tense
They hate me, see me and shake like a chain-link fence
By the looks of 'em, you would swear that Jaws was comin'
By the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawing someone
By the way they're running, you would swear the law was comin'
It's now or never, and tonight is all or nothin'
Momma, Jimmy keeps leaving on us, he said he'd be back
He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest
I'll be back, baby, I just gotta beat this clock
Fuck this clock, I'ma make 'em eat this watch
Don't believe me? Watch, I'ma win this race
And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch
I found my niche, you gon' hear my voice
'Til you sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice
If I gotta scream 'til I have half a lung
If I have half a chance I grab it  Rabbit, run!



Some days I just want to up and call it quits
I feel like I'm surroundedbya wall ofbricks
Every time I go to getup I just fall in pits
My life's like one great big ball of this
If I could just put it all into all I spit
Stead of always tryin to swallow it, instead of starin at this wall and bricks
While I sit writers block sick of all this stuff, can't call it, skitz
All I know is I'm about to hit the wall if I have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it
I ain't dealin with another flamin politic
I'm like a skillet, bubblin until it filter's up
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin up
Blow this building up, I've concealed enough
My cup runneth over, I done filled it up
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
You think all I do is stand here and feel my stuff
Well I'ma show you what, you gon feel my rush
You don't feel it then it must be too real to touch
Bill the dutch, I'm about to tear this up
Goosebumps, yea, I'ma make your hair sit up
Yea sit up, I'ma tell you who I be

Damn I'm stumped, uh, wait, here comes somethin
Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out
New pad, krinkle it up and throw the thing out
I'm fizzlin out, thought I figured it out
Ball's in my court but I'm scared to dribble it out

Cyanide, I spit to the grave, real enough to rile you up
Want me to flip it, I can rip it any style you want
I'm a switch-hitter, hit, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter
I'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a frickin boilin point
Put some oil in your joints, flip the coin boy, come get destroyed
An M.C.'s worst dream, I make em jinxed
They hate me, see me and shake like a chain-link fence
By the looks of em you would swear that Jaws was comin
By the screams of em you would swear I'm sawin someone
By the way they're runnin you would swear the law was comin
It's now or never, and tonight it's all or nothin
Mama, Jimmy keeps leavin on us, he said he'd be back
He pinky-promised, I don't think he's honest
I'll be back baby, I just gotta beat this clock
Screw this clock, I'ma make them eat this watch
Don't believe me, watch, I'ma win this race
And I'ma come back and rub my hits in your face, snitch
I found my niche, you gon hear my voice
Till you sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice
If I gotta scream til I have half a lung
If I have half a chance, I'll grab it
Rabbit run!



[Intro]
Eminem
Slim Shady
Representing Detroit, you know what I'm sayin'
With my man DJ Yooter, Dirty Dozen shit
What y'all know about Dirty Dozen shit
Shout out to [?]

[Verse]
Distorted, ordered by the court to be aborted
Snorted, right before these vocals were recorded
Morbid, too perverted
Stay alerted
Went to the club, murdered the first slut that flirted
Deserted, abandoned by my mama and it hurted
The worst nut my daddy ever squirted
Screamin, cussin, buzzin when I'm bustin, open sores pussin
I need another dose of Robitussin
Fussin over nothing
An army couldn't calm me
Bitching like a lady
Shady like a palm tree
What the fuck you call me, who you calling soft?
I'm still fresher than you and bitch I'm fallin off
I'm horny, and corny girls won't even cross my path
I'm so dirty, I don't even wash my ass
Never took a shower, cower from a scower
Prowler, clean your house out in half an hour
What's your flavor, how you want it, ripe or sour?
Rifle power
Snipe you from the Eiffel Tower
Too much weed, I'm bout to malfunction
Style's drunken, carjacking Al Duncan
Slim Shady, peace

[Verse]
Spray and wreck, with my man Sway & Tech
Freestylin' on the mic, rappers ain't know what's comin' next
Yo, I'm in a 'Vette breakin' necks
Cashin' checks, whiplashin' necks, smashin' decks
Freestyle right off the top, rappers ain't ready
Cut 'em like a machete
The Freddy of rap, hold it steady
Bustin' rhymes off the top of the dome wit' a popular poem
Forget a team, man, I can stop you alone
Killin' rappers, rappers ain't ready for the way I do it

[Lost Verse]
Fluent when I be kickin' these rhymes, ain't nothin' to it
'Cause I be bustin' 'em
Rappers ain't ready, ain't got no stamina
And I be bustin' rhymes on Sway & Tech in front of the camera
Damage ya like Ja Rule
Hey you, I'll mess up your debut
Rappers ain't ready for the way you can't save you
They can't save you, you're gone, you're finished
You're done, you're diminished
Rappers will never replenish
'Cause I'm Infinite, and when I step in it
In a minute, I'ma kill it when I bust rhymes
Rappers ain't ready, 'cause I don't feel it
Yo...



[Intro]
Yo, yo
(Huh, huh, huh, huh)
Aight, aight (huh)
Slim Shady
Yo, yo, yo

[Verse]
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4 door Ford
But I'm more towards droppin' an a cappella that'll chop a fella
To mozzarella, worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showin'
Developin' anorexia while I'm standin' next to ya
Eatin' a full course meal watchin' you starve to death
With an IV in your veins feedin' you liquid darvocet
Pumpin' you full of drugs, pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receivin' with the asses ripped out of they pants and given
A less than 20 percent chance of livin'
Have a possible placement, it's a hospital patient
Storin' the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream, "I'm still alive!"
Drivin' a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pullin' your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arson
To set fire to carpets and burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight, you need a crowbar to pry her apart with

[Outro]
Motherfucker
Slim Shady, bitch
Recognize
For the 99
I'm on February 23rd



[Verse]
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fuckin' head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with the 40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leavin' you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers? We blowin' up your house killin' your parents
And comin' back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keepin' a promise as Nostradamus
'Cause I ain't makin' no more threats
I'm doin' drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more 'cause I smoked crack today, yesterday and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin' together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!
Motherfucker!



[Intro]
Yeah
Definitely, definitely
Definitely dope
Definitely
Definitely K-Mart
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You find me offensive
I find you offensive for finding me offensive
Hence, if I should draw out or line any fences
If so, to what extents if any should I go
'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive
Psychological nerve damage to the brain
When I go to lengths this far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship and it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now 'cause I won't stand for this
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too, I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me, I even believe I
Had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must've put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault 'cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman, I killed Superman
And how ironic
That I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name

My aim was not to become what I became
With this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man

[Verse 2]
Now in the bible, it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
Have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course it's intercourse and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad
As long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during, or after
Performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids in a more derogatory way
But who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say?
Let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre (What up?)
I got a question if I may (Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt butt when he tees off (Yeah)
But, but, I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hut-hut
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant, it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped, and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details, but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
'Til then, I'll just walk around with a manly strut because

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name

My aim was not to become what I became
With this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man

[Verse 3]
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit this is the same verse, I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spider-Man is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whoop ass canister
Goddammit Dre, where's the goddamn beat? (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway, I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic, yup, yup, don't worry, I'm on it
I got it, high-five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away
And as she flew around the room like a balloon
I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can
And zoom, I headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich
And I don't even gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name

My aim was not to become what I became
With this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man

[Outro]
'Cause...
Yup, Rain Man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre
Super dope beat maker
2000, 2400 and 87 million, 900 and se-73,400 and 63... and 70
Yeah



[Round 1: Eminem]
Aight, look! Any rapper saying those kind of rhymes
In this day and age, in this period of time
Tryin' to battle Eminem is worse than David Starr
Tryin' to battle Proof, Eye-Kyu, B-Fat and Bizarre
[] That's why you beg to differ me
You ain't got no style, plus you lack delivery
Not to brag, I don't mean to boast
Look, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost
[]
You're that bitch, you couldn't slip into the zone
If I put banana peels around this fuckin' microphone
Go get a bull dozer, start from bottom to top
And tear this building down
Cause that's the only way you're wrecking shop



Whoa Nelly, Tell Angelina Jolie Im ready
With petroleum jelly, to smear it all over me belly
And tell her she can hit me on me mobile, me celly
And meet in the salami section of the grocery deli
And maybe we can find us an appropriate telly
A motel 6 or 8 it think they both could be helly
I hit it, then I quit it and I told her email me
And dont call me, Ill call you, can you feel me? Ho do you smell me?
Animal instinct, cannibalistic, I just ran out of lipstick, man Im a twisted, sick
Sadistic, son of a bitch, 666, Broke his crucifix made out of sticks then fixed it
Chick chick chick chick chick chick chick chick chick!
Now play it backwards muscle relaxers mixed with liquid
Dilaudid its diluted for a quick fix, your delusional illusions look realistic
..I Need Christopher Reeves to come and lay his verse
I think he can spit it better on Medicine Ball, first
Off I did not even realize the guy died
So I guess them Christopher Reeves jokes ain't gonna fly
Oh! I'm on a roll don't get me started
Ellen got pissed at me and tried to push me into the garden
With such accuracy she aims and shoots the target
Cupid's arrow done forced it...
Now look sweetheart it's the, kissing bandit
On a mission to leave Ms. Degeneres Disenchanted
By men now just listen dammit
Mr. Rossi I need no posse I single handed-
-ly will steal your heart with a kiss where should I plant it
Moi! baby its Moi! and my repertoire
Is running around in pink panties and leopard bra's
And negligah, neglige you say tomato I say tomah-to
I'm Tommy Motola Mariah don't stop me I'm on a roll
Oh!



Role Model?
I'll roll a model down a hill over broke bottles and coke products if she don't suck
And ? To the bumper hit the throttle while im tryna hit the pothose
I'll freakin take Madonna to McDonalds
Any ho in the porizontal getting fondeled
I don't cuddle I don't caddal
Only models that I follows
Everything I drive, whether it's a navo-ho or tatho
It's got a ho in it
Nah ho I don't got no freakin Bronco
You're looking for a buck? Get a horse ? tano
I got a rusty Honda with some bonda and a box of condoms
Little blonde Bitch Fuck me? Fuck you too
Like a Mcbanaro-boo-abano
And I ain't from this planet so nano - nano nano
I'm intolerable, too vilatle, screw it
I don't gotta make the Honor roll to be On a roll
I don't know much, But what I do know I do it pronto though
So knock it off all these knock-off me's
The last thing the world needs is another me
But if you think, this is part 2 to recovery
Or Love the way you lie part 12
Or something Heartfelt you're about to make a Discovery
Like you failed Christopher Columbus's compass
Aint dumbing shit down for you dumb motherfuckers so suck it
I took your best punchline like a punch in the stomach that punctured a lung punk but I'm still functioning from it
Chump, this is nothing now watch, while i fuck one up it and toot my horn
Once i think of something to trumpet
And i don't need a fucking In-strument to sound off like a trunk of a elephant the triumphent
Return of the ether spittin' retard, reborn, but chances of you having another rebirth, slim to none
Like a skinny Mother Theresa, Give a fuck it's easter! So kiss my keester! Because that's the only thing i turn the other cheek for !



High on? What'd you say, trick? What am I on?
Two tubes of airplane glue and a can of Krylon
Eatin' a crayon, settin' fire to rayon
Flamin' the nylons of two white lesbians screamin', "Die, blondes"
Strike matches on white patches of dry lawns
And I run and jump right in front of the fire hydrants
Five blunts, and you expect me to die once
With nine lives, fuckin' chickens in front of my blind wives?
Suicidal, my friends tell me to try knives
You wanna mess with a mothafucka who skydives
Out of a plane to give the Statue of Liberty high fives?
Doin' drive-bys and miss you with five tries
It's Slim Shady and BET and Big Tigger, all y'all who see me flee



[Verse]
I'ma get snuffed, cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
I'll pipe down when the White House gets wiped out
When I see that little Cheney dyke get sniped out
Lights out, bitch, adis, goodnight [gunshot] (AHH!)
Now put that in your little pipe and bite down
Think for a minute, cause the hype just died down
That I won't go up in the Oval Office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
I'm all for America; fuck the government!
Tell that C. Delores Tucker slut to suck a dick
Motherfucker ducked, what the fuck? Son of a bitch!
Take away my gun, I'm gonna tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switchblade with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a six to a sixteen inch blade
Shit's like a samurai sword; a sensei
Shit just don't change to this day
I'm this way, still tell that ut-slay itch-bay
Uck-say my ick-day, 'scuse my ig-pay atin-lay
But uck-fay you ig-pay (50!!!)



[Intro]
"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings."
"But I'm only going to get this one chance."
"Something's wrong, I can feel it."
Six minutes. Six minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
"Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; and if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances."
"You are just what the doc ordered."

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like  have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet RunD.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a massacre
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
"Oy vey, that boy's gay!"that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Kryptonno, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream."
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,"'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use."
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retardbe a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?







[Intro]
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)

[Verse]
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and

[Intro]
"Guarda, stavo per andarci leggero con te e non ferire i tuoi sentimenti"
"Ma coglier quest'occasione e basta."
"Qualcosa non va lo sento."
Sei minuti. Sei minuti. Sei minuti, Slim Shady, sei in onda!
"Solo un sentore che ho. Tipo che sta per succedere qualcosa, ma non so cosa. Se significa quello che penso significa siamo nei guai, grossi guai; e se  cosi pazzo come dici, non rischier nulla."
"Sei solo quello che il doc ha ordinato

[Chorus]
Sto cominciando a sentirmi come un Rap God, Rap God
Tutti i miei fan dal fronte al retro annuiscono, annuiscono
Ora, chi pensa che le loro braccia siano abbastanza lunghe per fare a ceffoni, ceffoni
Dicono che rappo come un robot, quindi chiamami Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
Ma per me rappare come un computer deve essere nei miei geni
Ho un portatile nella mia tasca posteriore
La mia penna esploder quando lo impugno
Ho un grosso legame con il profitto del rap
Ci ho fatto i soldi per una vita  e un casino sopra
Sin da quando Clinton era ancora presidente
Con Monica Lewinski che gli leccava lo scroto
Sono un MC onesto come allora
Sillabe, Abilista (Abile + Alcolista) (Uccidi tutti con queste)
Questo hip hop innovativo, cattivo, esplicito
Non vuoi davvero fare a gare a chi piscia pi lontano
Con questa canaglia del rap, che porta un MAC nel retro di un' Ac'
Impacchetta il rap di merda, chiacchiera, parla
E allo stesso identico momento in cui provo questi esercizi lirici acrobatici
Sar ancora in grado di rompere un fottuto tavolo
Dietro a una coppia di froci e a romperlo a met
Solo io ho capito che ero ironico, ho firmato all'Aftermath dopo l'evento
Come potevo non sfondare? Tutto quello che faccio sono bombe-F
Sentite la mia ira dell'attacco
I rapper stanno avendo un periodo duro, ecco un'assorbente enorme
 proprio disastrosamente pessimo per gli scarsi
Mentre sto costruendo questo capolavoro con maestria

[Chorus]
Sto cominciando a sentirmi come un Rap God, Rap God
Tutti i miei fan dal fronte al retro annuiscono, annuiscono
Ora, chi pensa che le loro braccia siano abbastanza lunghe per fare a ceffoni, ceffoni
Dicono che rappo come un robot, quindi chiamami Rap-bot

[Verse 2]
Tutti quanti vogliono la chiave ed il segreto per l'immortalit nel rap che ho. Beh, per essere veritieri il metodo 
Semplicente rabbia ed esuberanza giovanile
Tutti quanti amano tifare per una seccatura
Ho colpito la Terra come un'asteroide
Da allora non ho fatto altro che mirare alla luna (Pew!)
Gli MC vanno a scuola con questa musica
Perch la uso come veicolo per "spostare la rima"
Ora guido una nuova scuola piena di studenti
Io? Sono un prodotto di Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella,Eazy, grazie, hanno creato Slim
Mi hanno ispirato abbastanza per crescere, un giorno sfondare ed essere nella posizione
Di incontrare Run-D.M.C., invitarli nella fottuta Hall of Fame del Rock and Roll
Anche se entrer in chiesa ed esploder in una palla di fiamme
L'unica Hall of Fame in cui entrer sar l'alcol of fame
Sopra il muro della vergogna
Voi froci pensati che sia tutto un gioco
Voi froci pensate che sia tutto un gioco, fino a che cammino su un mare di fuoco
Sopra una tavola, e ditemi a che cazzo state pensando?
Piccolo ragazzino che sembra gay
Cos gay che a malapena riesco a dirlo senza ridere, bel ragazzino
Stai assistendo ad un massacro
Come se guardassi una messa svolgersi, bel ragazzino
"Oh ehy, quel ragazzo  gay!"-  tutto quello che dicono, bel ragazzino
Ti prendi un pollice in su, una pacca sulla spalla
E un "vai cos" dalla tua etichetta ogni giorno, bel ragazzino
Hey bel ragazzino! Che dici bel ragazzino?
Ho preso un "Hell yeah" da Dre, bel ragazzino
Lavorer per tutto quello che ho, non chieder mai un cazzo a nessuno
Sparisci dalla mia vista, bel ragazzino!
Praticamente, ragazzo, non sarai mai capace
Di tenere lo stesso mio ritmo, bel ragazzino, perch

[Chorus]
Sto cominciando a sentirmi come un Rap God, Rap God
Tutti i miei fan dal fronte al retro annuiscono, annuiscono
Il modo in cui corro attorno a questa traccia, chiamami NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt nel campo delle roulotte, Il bianco Dio del teash
Inginocchiati davanti al generale Zod
Questo pianeta  Krypton-no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
Quindi tu sarai Thor e io sar Odino
Tu arrogante, io onnipotente
Smetto, dopo ricarico
Immediatamente con queste bombe, sto mirando
E non dovrei essere risvegliato
Sono la morte che cammina, ma solo una testa parlante, uno zombie fluttuante
Ma ho tua mamma che mi succhia il cazzo
Sono fuori dal mio Noodle Ramen
Non abbiamo niente in comune, fallito
Sono un Doberman, datti un pizzico sul braccio e mostra rispetto, allievo
Sono io, la mia onest  brutale
Ma onestamente  inutile, se non utilizzo che faccio perci
Almeno una volta ogni tanto
Voglio essere sicura cho da qualche parte nei miei scarabocchi da gallina, io faccia abbastanza rime nei miei sgorbi e scarabocchi da poter provare e aiutare qualcuno a superare brutti momenti
Ma devo tenermi alcune battute finali perch anche voi rapper senza contratto
Siete affamati, guardatemi, sono il vostro pranzo
Lo so che c stato un tempo in cui sono stato il re
Dell underground , ma faccio ancora rap, sono il goal  Pharoahe Monch
Perci io mastico rime, ma qualche volta, quando mescoli
Attrazione con il colore della mia pelle
Diventi troppo potente e eccoli qui loro che provano a censurarti
Come quella rima che io ho scritto in Im Back di Mathers L.P
Dove io provo a dire che prendo 7 bambini dalla Columbine
Li metto tutto in liena, aggiungo un AK-47 , un revolver, una nove millimetri
Vedi, se riesco a farla franca ora con questa rima che non sono cos grande come ero
Ma mi sono trasformato in un essere immortale che viene da un portale
Ma tu sei rimasto fermo nello spazio temporale del 2004, credo
E non so per quale cazzo di motivo rimi a fare
Tu sei senza senso come Rapulzel senza quelle fottute treccine
Tu sei tipo normale, fanculo essere normale
E io ho appena comprato una nuova pistola a raggi X dal futuro
Solamente per venire e a spararti  come quando Fabolous  ha fatto incazzare Ray J
Perch Fab ha detto che lui sembrava un frocio nel suo appartamento in Mayweather
Cantando ad un uomo mentre suonano il piano
Amico, oh, amico, quello fu uno speciale di 24 su 24, 7 giorni su 7  in una canale via cavo
E allora Ray J  and dritto alla radio il giorno dopo
Hey, Fab, ti ammazzo!
Le rime ti arriveranno troppo veloci ora
Uh, sama lamaa,dumaa, lamaa tu credi che io sia un essere umano
Quello che sto cercando di farti capire  che io sono un supereroe
Originale, sono stato creato dalla gomma
Perci tutto quello che tu mi dici mi rimbalza contro e diventer colla per te
Sono devastante, di pi di quello che ho dimostrato
Come dare una fottuta audience  la sensazione che stiano lievitando
Non declina mai, e lo so che gli Haters aspetteranno per sempre
Il giorno che loro potranno dire che io sono crollato, celebreranno
Perch io so che il modo per motivarli
Io faccio musica per sollevarti, tu fai la musica per gli ascensori
Oh, lui  cos di tendenza
Beh, questo  quello che dicono quando diventando gelosi, si confondono
Non  hip hop,  pop, perch ho trovato il giusto modo per fonderli
Con il rock, shock rap con il Dottore
Ho tirato fuori lose yourself e li ho fatti perdere (nella musica)
Non so come fare canzoni cos
Non so quale parole usare
Lascia che ti spieghi come possa accadere questo a te
Mentre sto rappando tutti questi versi, contro di te
Fa male, ti sto inavvertitamente facendo male
Quanti versi devo uccidere per provarlo
Che tu sei alquanto carino nelle tue canzoni, puoi sacrificare le vergini
Bocciato a scuola, pillola dipendete
Ma guarda quanti grammy la mi attitudine mi ha portato
Sono pieno di me stesso, ma sempre affamato
Mi costringo a fare ci che voglio fare
Sono mille volte sopra di te, malato quando parlo diverso lingue
Cos ubriaco che Satana ha preso il timone, mi sono addormentato nel sedile
Ascoltando Heavy D e Boys, ancora potente ma funky
Ma nella mia testa c qualcosa che sento  che mi strattona e lotta
Angeli che lottano con i diavoli e ecco cosa vogliono da me
Mi chiedono di eliminare alcune delle donne che io odio
Ma se prendi in considerazione lamaro disprezzo che io ho avuto
Allora tu potrai essere un pochino paziente e pi comprensivo per la situazione
E riusciresti a capire le discriminazioni
Ma fanculo, la vita ti sta dando limoni, allora fai le limonate
Ma se io non posso comportarmi meglio con le donne, come cazzo posso  cucinare a loro una torta allora?
Non confondermi per Satana
 un errore fatale se tu pensi che io abbia bisogno di uno sconosciuto per
Prendere una vacanza  per viaggiare in giro
E farla colpire nella sua stessa faccia , e non essere un ritardato
Essere un re? Credo di no, per quale motivo essere un Re quando puoi essere Dio?



(Dial tone)

[Eminem & Fat Beats Receptionist]
(Fat Beats)
Um, I was wondering if you have, um, wha-what's his name?
Sli-Eminem, or Slim Shady
Cause a friend of mine's got the album (already?)
Yeah! (He bought it?)--The whole album
I don't know if he bought it, I don't know if he got it off the internet
I don't know, I don't know what the deal is (uh huh)
I don't know, but he's got it, like--(Yeah, well we don't-we're not selling it)
Aww, well cause the third, have you heard the third track? (No I haven't heard it)
Th-the, okay, aw, I was wondering who produced it, the third track
I don't know, cause the snare, the snare is like "csh, csh, csh"
(Well I really don't know, I don't know the song)
Aw okay, alright
Well if it-cause everybody's telling me they have it
I don't, I don't know, is it--(Yeah I don't, I don't know where it's at either)
Oh okay, is Ka--(I have to take another call sir)
Okay I didn't mean to hold you up I'm sorry (alright)
Fuck you!



[Eminem & Fat Beats Receptionist]
I was like -oh, hello? (Yeah)
Um, I-I just have one more question
I don't know if you were the guy we were talking to, um
I just called a few minutes ago, about Eminem (okay)
Um, probably what I was wondering, um
Is if, I-I-I don't know, I've seen Eminem
(What's the question, sir?)
He did a show at Tramps and his hair was like, blond
And I was wondering, actually, that's not even a question
But I was wondering, um, is-is-is
Is Dr. Dre, um, is he white?
(muffled sounds]
(Hello?)
H-Hello, hi (yes)
Um, I had a que-
The oh-this ain't the--, oh this a girl
(This is a girl, yeah) Oh, I-I'm sorry
I had a couple of questions about, um, about this guy Eminem
I-I know him, I-I'd, I know him, I've-I've like, I've like studied him
I-I've-I know all his freestyles by heart
(Okay, can you please lower your voice?)
I'm sorry, I'm just really excited because something-
My friend came over here, the album (Uhuh)
And, I don't know how he got the album, he sa-
He said he got it off the internet or something
But I was figuring like, maybe Fat Beats like, had a bootleg
Or something that I could just get
I wouldn't, like, turn you guys in or nothing like that, just--
(We don't have Eminem's album, Eminem's album coming out in February)
They don't have it Brian, you fucking dick!
Okay, is-is-is-i-i-i, it's, um
Is Dr. Dre white?
(Dr. Dre is not white, that I know of
The Dr. Dre I know ain't white, I don't know)
Oh! (He's black as I know him)
Oh, okay, okay, oh!
Dr. Dre, the Dr. Dre from The Chronic, you asshole!
You guys are so-- you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
These guys are embarassing me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry (alright)
Dr. Dre is not white, Dr. Dre is not white, you fucking dicks
Hello? (yeah)
Ok, thank you very much (You're welcome)
Ok, goodbye

[Chorus: RBX]
Remember me? Seven executions
Remember me? I have no remorse
Remember me? I'm high-powered
Remember me? I drop bombs, like Hiroshima

[Verse 1: RBX]
For this one, they scream "X, you retarded?!"
'Cause I grab the mic and get down like syndrome
Hide and roam into the masses
Without boundaries, which qualifies me
For the term universal without no rehearsal
I leak words that's controversial
Like I'm not the one you wanna contest, see
'Cause I'll hit your ass like the train did that bitch
That got banned from TV, heavyweight getup
Hit you, watch your whole head split up
Loco is the motion, we comin' through
Hollow-tips is the lead the .45 threw

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz]
Remember me? Throw ya gunz in the air!
Remember me? Slam! Slam!
Remember me? Nigga, bacdafucup!
Remember me? Chka-chka-Onyx!

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
Niggas that take no for an answer get told no
Yeah, I been told no, but it was more like No! No! No!
Life's a bitch, met her, fuck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor
This vet is ahead of the shit, it's all redder, you deader and deader
A medic instead of the cheddars and credda
Settle vendetta with metal Beretta from ghetto to ghetto
Evidence, nope, never leave a shred of
I got the soul of every rapper in me, love me or hate me
My mom's got raped by the industry and made me
I'm the illest nigga ever, I told you
I get more pussy than them dyke bitches Total
Want beef, nigga? Pbbt, you better dead that shit
My name should be Can't-Believe-That-Nigga-Said-That-Shit
Probably sayin' he ain't a killer, but I'm killin' myself
Smoke death, fuck bitches raw on the kitchen floor
So think what I'ma do to you, have done to you
Got niggas in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two
What you wanna do? Cocksuckers, we Glock busters
'Til the cops cuff us, gon' start ruckus and drop blockbusters
Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
I'm gettin' wires, niggas wantin' me dead
Wantin' my head, you think it could be somethin' I said?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Remember me? I just don't give a fuck!
Remember me? Yeah, fuck you too!
Remember me? I'm low down and I'm shifty!
Remember me? I'm Shady!

[Verse 3: Eminem (& Dr. Dre)]
When I go out, I'ma go out shootin'
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid!
I'm tryin' to clean up my fuckin' image
So I promised the fuckin' critics
I wouldn't say fuckin' for six minutes
Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin' these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on?
Came home and somebody musta broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trench coats
Six sick dreams of picnic scenes
Two kids, sixteen, with M-16's and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?!
Fuck that! Pbbt, you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
And reappear in hell with a can of gas and a match
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at!
(What the fuck you starin' at, nigga?)

[Outro: Eminem]
Don't you remember me?
Remember me? Remember me?
Remember me? (Slim Shady!)



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo! I bust in, devilish grin, disgustin'
Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt-chin
Callin' all party animals, get
On the floor when I pop up on some Whac-A-Mole shit
In search of a chick who's stacked and so thick
And implants are so big
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits
Like Anna Nicole Smith
Body's bananas and sass to go with
I spot you at first glance and go "shit!"
You wearin' those pants that don't fit
That butt won't ever give up
That's why you stick it out no matter what, huh?
'Cause you got an ass that won't quit
So, get on the horn, my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow "whee"
You just laugh and go heehee
'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate
That's why

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (Yeah, me)

[Interlude: Eminem]
You know, I'm wearin' a new shirt tonight too
With me on it

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea
The plan's to bring you to my house
You're drinkin' Jack and Beam
I'm thinkin' soon this tramp'll lean so we should bounce
But you're outta your tube-top
If you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
Yeah, you're a cute fox
Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
Girl, you're smokin' like Snoop Dogg
But you must be tokin' if you think you're takin' over my quarters
There goes the dime into the jukebox
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll
Turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
So, Rick, scratch on the break like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (Yeah, me)

[Bridge: Eminem & Joan Jett & The Blackhearts]
Said "Can I take you home, where we can be alone?"
Shorty, you the shit, girl, I ordered you to sit
I know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceilin'
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Beside ya fired up like a starter pistol
Crystal, let's slide hon, tonight I'm your pilot
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl
You're so fucking fly, you belong in the mile high club
So come on, baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm high-strung
We might wind up on mound like we're tryin' for the Cy Young
Fuckin' 'fore we get to the house
Screwin' our brains out like changing a lightbulb
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim and fire
Yes, babe, Im fallin' in like, that's kinda, why I love

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (Yeah, me)



Yeah
Damn girl
Do I drive you crazy?
You make me crazy, too
You make me do things
I normally wouldn't do
You make me feel things
That I never felt
You gotta be the real thing
Cause you remind me of myself



[Verse 1: Royce]
It's several different levels to picking up shovels
And dumping you in ditches under sea level
Front and you can witness
Let me refreshen you niggas, tell you my position in this
(Ch-chk!) Beef! Leave you under Venice, opposition finished
Here it is, we invaded, created a pyramid
Of a Haven of names, so blame Dre, and that ear of his
So (ah-ha, ah-ha) breathe, I'd rather reach for your neck
And I never heat you for respect, unless you greet me with less
I got a skunk in my trunk, I'm lying, I got a pump in my trunk
You dying, how many lumps niggas want?
Who's ready for y'all? We ready for y'all
We too incredibly raw for any artist that said he would draw
I stand firm, and it hurts to live it
You open that can of worms
I hope you ready for the dirt that's with it
Slap a ho, snatch a mic
Being brought to y'all in black and in white
(It's the new!) Joe Jackson and Ike
We renegades

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
Cause see, they call me a menace
And if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference
They're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Nah, nah, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned
And keep your ears glued to the stereo
'Cause, here we go: He's Royce, he's the King of Detroit
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a

[Hook: Eminem]
renegade!
Never been afraid to say what's on my mind
At any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to talk about anything
(Anything?) Anything
'Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to say what's on my mind
At any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to talk about anything
(Anything?) Anything (Anything)

[Verse 3: Royce]
I determine what time it's on, I call my nigga Proof
Hand him a pint of Limon and turn him loose
I'm tired of you new jacks, I'm tired of niggas that's like (I'm 'bout to blow)
Unless you a bitch, we don't care if you 'bout do that
Move back, youngster, the Glock gon' speak
Chew up your vest and turn your chest hair to taco meat
The street, continuous to pit, quick to smash ya
Or flash the clip, or give you the picture, develop the
Click clock, six shots blows through another door
And it gets hot, Hip-hop Quotable tug of war
Who did you niggas' beats, you bitches, who made it work?
That shit was *pfft*  I got harder two-way alerts
Just when I thought my dog couldn't get any meaner
You talk about his daughter, he probably go get you the nina
You talk about his momma, he won't even give you the finger
(He's crazy) Deranged, not media eaters, we renegades

[Verse 4: Eminem]
See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the King of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
As a monger of hate and Satan, a scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today
See it's as easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie
While I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they try to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers
'Cause I'm a motherfuckin'

[Verse: Alice and the Glass Lake]
I've drowned in high from the ashes
Now I can't recall your laughter
The smoke of everything go grasp
At ends of what's left over
And the lights in every broken
Blown-out window screaming, laughing
I hope to feel it coursing out
This is our revival



(dialing tone)

[Dialogue: Eminem & (Masseur)]
(Hello?)
Hi, can I speak to Rex please?
(Speaking)
How ya doin', um, my name's Ken
Um, I'm lookin' for a buddy
(What do you need?)
Just- cold work my wife is sitting right here
Um, just a buddy, like, you know, a friend
Someone to pal around with
I'm thirty-two, I'm, I'm single
Can it be arranged?
(When?)
Um, whenever
If you have time tonight, um, that'd be great
I mean, I'm just- I'm really waiting
(I don't understand what you're looking for)
Cock massage, whatever
I'm just really ready
I've been waiting too long
(I don't under- what do you mean)
I mean, I'm just ready
You know, like
(Well, I mean its, what I do is a massage)
Alright, do you use lubricants?
(Right)
Cause- okay
Aww, good, thank god, cause-
I was wondering cause I never, I never did this before
But man... Rex
(But you know I'm not working tonight, so you'll have to call me another time)
Really? Um, okay, what about tomorrow
(Yeah give me a call tomorrow)
Okay, if- what time should I call
(Well, whenever you're- you know, you know for sure your schedule)
Ok- are we gonna fuck or what cause I'm ready
(No)
Please?
[Hangs up]
(Laughs)



[Intro: Sample + Eminem]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
("What's your name?") Marshall
("Who's your daddy?") I don't have one

[Verse 1]
My mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle, then crashed in
The side of loco-motive with rap, I'm
Loco, it's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'Bout to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap, "In a spasm
Your music usually has 'em
But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't
Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan."
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and
Thoughts are entertainin'
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seein' eye dog
Can't even find the page I was writing this rhyme on
Oh, it's on the ram-page
Couldn't see what I wrote, I write small
It says, "Ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with whitewalls
Had a fire in my heart
And a dire desire to aspire to Die Hard."
So as long as I'm on the clock, punching this time card
Hip-hop ain't dying on my watch

[Chorus]
Now sometimes when I'm sleepin'
She comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine?
Don't got time, don't care, don't have two shits to give
Let me take you by the hand to promised land
And threaten everyone
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

[Bridge: Sample + Eminem]
("Now, what's your name?") Marshall
("Who's your daddy?") I dont know him, but I wonder
("Is he rich like me?") Ha
("Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?")

[Verse 2]
No, if he had
He wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad
Yeah, Dad, I'm the epitome and the prime
Example of what happens when the power of the rhyme
Falls into the wrong hands and
Makes you want to get up and start dancin'
Even if it is Charles Manson
Who just happens to be rappin', blue lights flashin'
Laughin' all the way to the bank, lampin' in my K-Mart mansion
Im in the style department
With a pile in my cart, rippin' the aisle apart but
With great power comes
Absolutely no responsibility for content
Completely despondent and condescending
The king of nonsense and controversy is on a
Beat-killing spree, Your Honor
I must plead guilty, 'cause I sparked a revolution
Rebel without a cause who caused the evolution
Of rap, to take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
("Hip-hop is the Devil's music")
Does that mean it belongs to me?
'Cause I just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you hear a beep
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, 'cause it's the

[Chorus]
It's the time of the season
When hate runs high
And this time, I won't give it to you easy
When I take back what's mine
With pleasured hands
And torture everyone, that is my plan
My job here isn't done
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

[Bridge: Sample + Eminem]
("What's your name?") Shady
("Who's your daddy?") I dont give a fuck, but I wonder
("Is he rich like me?") Doubt it, ha
("Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?")

[Verse 3]
So, yeah, Dadlet's walk
Let's have us a father-and-son talk
But I bet we wouldn't probably get one block
Without me knocking your block off, this is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm so bananas I a-ppealed to all those walks
Of life, whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
'Cause I related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're rippin' out their fuckin' hair again, it's hysterical
I chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
Yeah, uh-oh, better beware, knuckle heads!
The sign of my hustle says:
"Don't knock, the door's broken, it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold-cocked
You critics come to pay me a visit?
Misery loves company, please stay a minute!"
Kryptonite to a hypocrite
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy gettin' stoned in your glass house
To kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out
Mr. Mathers as advertised on the flyers, so spread the word
'Cause I'm promoting my passion until I'm passed out
Completely brain-dead: Rain Man
Doing a Bankhead in a restraint chair
So, bitch, shoot me a look, it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas
I'm angrier than all eight other reindeer
Put together with Chief Keef 'cause I hate every fuckin' thang, yeah
Even this rhyme, bitch
And quit tryin' look for a fuckin' reason for it that ain't there
But I still am a "Criminal!"
Ten-year-old degenerate grabbin' on my genitals!
The last Mathers LP done went diamond
This time I'm predicting this one will go emerald!
When will the madness end?
How can it when there's no method to the pad and pen?
The only message that I have to send
Is: "Dad, I'm back at it again!"

[Outro]
Yeah (Who's your daddy?)



I put my orange
4 Inch
Door hinge in storage
And ate porridge
With George



[Hook]
So, Just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick
It's also Richard cause I feel like you should
Pry your fucking mouth up off of it
I said just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick
You ain't gotta be no detective to figure out I'm a dick
When I hold my privates to your first clue, Sherlock, prick!

[Verse 1]
And I would like to introduce myse-self, surprise! Hi, it's Ike
'bout to get my Ike on I come with a life supply of wife beaters
And my Nikes on and a white tee over that iron mic
Lookin' fly tonight, feel like I might die from a spider bite
Come back as Spider-Man, park my Peter inside a dyke
Bitch actin' like she got fuckin' higher standards than Meijer's, right
Had to pry her fingers off the mothafuckin' Breyer's ice cream
With the pliers, like "Ahh!" only a ruthless bastard would do this
Take a toothless bitch with no taste buds to Ruth's Chris
Give her toothpicks, stop on the way home, pick up two Big Bufords
Scrupulous, girl, you got a nice pair, but you're plumb stupid!
So when I pull up in that Benz, don't try to pretend you ain't interested
To impress your stupid ass friends and refuse to get in woman
And get slammed on the ground and snap like a pool stick against cement
If you sick of dick, pretend it's a musical instrument
You get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
I can tell at first glance you're a ho cause your pants are so tight
When you dance with O. Trice, your implants explode
So cold to dykes, the chance is snow in San Francisco
Boy I'm from Detroit city, you live in animosity
That's a fucked up state to be in, such an atrocity
Look where these random thoughts get me in senseless mind babble
"What me? Apologize?" That's just the way the rhyme unravels
And I wouldn't fucking take it back if I time traveled!

[Hook]
So, Just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick
It's also Richard cause I feel like you should
Pry your fucking mouth up off of it
I said just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick
You ain't gotta be no detective to figure out I'm a dick
When I hold my privates to your first clue, Sherlock, prick!
Just call me Richard



[Hook: Eminem]
Once you call my name out, things will never be the same
They should've never let us get our foot in this game

[Verse: Eminem]
Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missing a screw like Bishop in Juice, I could lose it
At any moment, those who know me know it
So they probably told to go with the flow, just so that
I don't explode, and- have another episode
Where I let it go as far as the one with Benzino did
I'm waiting for that next beef, I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad
I'm going bananas, my dick's so hard Anna Nicole could
Use it to fucking pole vault with
Oh shit! I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'd it (Heheheh!)
Anybody I throw flames at, gets a name
It's a game, 'cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame, what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Everyday, it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy-buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have something to do with that
They all trying get that stamp
They after that Shady/Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally understand "How to Rob" fully
50 Cent was like a fucking jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fucking lottery
And the damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers?
When we rhyme with each other, in time we discovered
That we had more in common that we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers, our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault?
'Cause we started thinking God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence it is, 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica
Queens, I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's getting dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come, and, uhh-
Operate, that's when he popped up at number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wondering
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye-to-eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is, if it is, I could give a shit
I'm still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
Egos aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nikes, Earthlings, how do you like these?
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats
Stomping, I been romping
Since Tim Dog was, hollering, "Fuck Compton"
I was whiling, freestyling
Back when, they were still making, Maxell casettes
I wasn't even rap's Elvis yet, that tells us that
Any doubts in your head that seals the shit
Ricky ticky toc, ticky ticky toc
Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc
And ya' don't stop



[Intro]
Aw, man, yeah
You ever be in the club, man, you get in a fight
And people that you don't even know jump in?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You feel like you wanna hit somethin'
Your fist clenches, you're pissed
You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this
You're 'bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away
From splittin' your shit wide open, no stitches can save
You'll die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way
You end up going out, but I guess it just is, I'm afraid
Razors, scissors and blades make Jason say, "Isn't this great?"
On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate
That's startin' to take place in the middle of the street
Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl
Soon as you heard this beat
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene
But it's too late, it's absolute pandemonium
Whisked away in an ambulance is your fate
Nothing nobody told you when you left the house today
Could've made you anticipate such an ass-whipping, okay
'Til the anger dissipates
You'll get punched in the face, reciprocate, come on

[Chorus]
So what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said, so what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

[Verse 2]
You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
You better go get your mace 'cause Shady said so
You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
That's how fuckin' rowdy you feel, now do you still wanna grill?
If you don't wanna get the shit beat out of you, chill
'Cause if you doubt me, you will
Yeah, got me a pill, found me a thrill
I got a couple of drinks here, and I'm bound to refill
Girl, howdy, how do you feel, ma?
This cocksucker did not spill my drink, oh, hell nah
He must be trying to kill my buzz
I will not budge, so what the deal, ridaz?
Now here they all come
And they got your back in, like, two seconds flat
And that's probably a record, yeah, you wasn't expecting that
'Cause they want in on the act, there's a Cognac bottle
We snuck it in 'cause the beer
That they was serving here was only tap
I'm bitin', I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts
You're frightened like, "This guy might hurt me"
You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder
Play smarter, you may start her over, you need a chainsaw to
Dig your way out or go powder your nose, pussy
The louder you yell, the harder I slap the shit outta you hoes
You set it off, faggot, so now how do you 'spose we settle it?
Hit me in the nose and we'll see how it goes

[Chorus]
So what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said, so what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

[Verse 3]
It's sheer hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles
We're tusslin', the crowd's starting to cheer us and
Adrenaline's rushin' through us just like a geyser gushin'
Too much Budweiser in my blood
I'm stranglin' your windpipe for nothing
My signature's ligature marks, look at you all
Big with your remarks 'til I swing an icepick at your heart
At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart
And dig at ya, and break you down like the bitch that you are
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
The pain inflicted upon you is so sick, it's bizarre
Shit, this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
As havin' me wanna rip out your fricking ligaments, ah
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails for that
You catch an open hand slap like a female like bap
In fact, I'll have the crowd smackin' you themselves
Where's D12? I don't feel like doing this by myself, come on

[Chorus]
So, what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said, so what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

[Outro]
Yeah, what the deal?
I'm feeling hard as hell right now homie
I almost feel... invincible and shit
Ay Dre! You got me feeling like I can't be touched right now fool
I'm unstoppable
Damn



[Verse 1]
I feel phenomenal as usual
Pharmaceuticals, glue sniffin', pools of vomit at Bonnaroo
But I don't know if I'm in Tennessee, Chicago, or Houston
In the corner tryin' to seek solitude
Shallow but such a hollow dude
I won't even swallow solid food
Alcoholic too, plus I'm on lean like the Tower of Pisa
Top it off I'm on mushrooms, so fuck all of you!
Roses are violet, mollies are blue
Lost in a ball of confusion, it's all an illusion
It's probably the shrooms I'm on
Cause I think I started hallucinating, cause I just thought I heard Jay Electronica and Odd Future's new shit
And all I could do was follow the music
And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza
Fillin' water balloons with nail-polish remover
Just to pop 'em and wallow in fumes
I feel uptight, I gotta get looser
After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution
Concentrated like orange juice, so I'm not as deluded
Cause all this delusion got me seein' shit
Excusez-moi, but that hoochie that passed
You see her ass? Wouldn't make her my main squeeze
Butt juicier, ass, it belongs in a juicer
It's mouth-waterin' too
So I walked over to her, like, Im Marshall
Wanna try to meet my standards? I'll introduce ya"
Oh, I'm a misogynist too, but I'm not a masseuse
But my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth, uh!
Chronic abuser, and I don't mean a user of marijuana
I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers
Got a bazooka, a shotgun, a Ruger, a Glock, and a nuke
And a Rottweiler too, and I'm not in the mood, so
When I say I'm bringing the TEC out
I'm not coming to repair your fuckin' electronic computers
God, I'm gonna puke, I'm so gone off the hookah
I think I swallowed a loofah
I'm tore up, demolished, I'm fuckin' stoned like Oliver
Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her
The thoughts I produce are loony tunes
The box of reusable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes
That were placed next to Veronica's boobs
And the paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box
In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues
The girl was just not the one suitable for him

[Hook]
Right for me, (that will) change me
Rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me
Dont laugh, please listen to me

[Verse 2]
Thought Id give in to the pressure
Collapse and crumble perhaps, relapsing under that
Well, that's a bunch of crap
In the clutch, I'm the Captain Crunch of rap
And I'm sick of acting humble, that's enough of that
Fuck that shit, cut the sack
Like it's a natural reaction
That's why I'm actually trapped in this shoving match
Cause push keeps coming to that
I can keep getting my ass kicked and coming back
Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit, still mad
Disgruntled, had some struggles, yeah
But that passion and hunger's back
What a fantastic juggling act!
And the way I flip my tongue on the track
It's like verbal acrobatics, but in fact
Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic
I fuckin' crashed my hovercraft
After I strapped a duffel bag to my back
And stuffed a massive punchin' bag in it
And an elastic bungee strap, rubber, plaster, a thumb tack
And a piece of plastic bubble wrap
Went spastic and fuckin' snapped
Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid
Stumbled back, recovered, back flipped
And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat
And for my last trick, lunge on back
Latch on a NASA shuttle flap, fuckin' snap the rudder in half
Chuckled and laughed, utter my last rebuttal
And just as I'm to come crashin'
I grab my Go-Go-Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress and ceramic construction hat
Rub my magic mushroom tat
For luck, then splat, get up from that
Face taped to a waste paper basket
Throw up, then gasp, lungs collapsed
And that's more likely than finding someone that's

[Hook]
Right for me, (that will) change me
Rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me
Dont laugh, please listen to me

[Verse 3]
Couple of shots of Jger
Public intoxication, dis-fuckin'-combobulation
Flooded with thoughts of anger
While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin'
"You're top ten, ain't cha?"
Stop it, you fuckers are talkin' crazy
And stop interrupting, you're not even up in that conversation
Whether you're punchin' a clock or famous
Underground, pop, or nameless
Whatever your job is, I give a fuck what's your occupation
You're thinkin' just cause you came in with scrubs
And you brought the scalpel and sponge
The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon
Stuck in the operating room
Once you done swapped your name with him
Smuggled in Ronald Reagan
If you dug him up; Donald Fagen
While juggling waffles, bacon
A fuckin' McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagled it
Flung it across the table
Then bump it and knock it shake it
Jumped and got in the way, then disrupted my concentration
I said fuck it and lost my patience
They all woke up from sedation
Ain't none of you Dr. Dre, so then what is it got you thinkin'
You can fuck with this operation?!
Aftermath, still running hip-hop amazin'
I'm still pluggin' along
No need for an assumption, here's confirmation
I'm up for the long duration
I'm just looking for something to walk away with
Some pocket change and a little integrity
Though I'll probably be jumpin' across the stage
'Til I'm fuckin' Madonna's age and
Stuck in an awkward place in my life
But I shit you not like I'm plugged up with constipation
That day will come
Before I finally stumble upon some lady thats

[Hook]
Right for me, (that will) change me
Rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me
Dont laugh, please listen to me



[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run



[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Intro]
Ayo, this song is dedicated
To all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck

[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
I'm 'bout to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they flossin' in they Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless
Them snakes slither in the grass, spineless

[Chorus]
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

[Verse 2]
My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play
'Cause when we die, we know we all goin' the same way
'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
Or comfortable and roomy in a 6
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away

[Chorus]
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

[Verse 3]
There's people that love me and people that hate me (Yup)
But it's the evil that made me
This backstabbin', deceitful and shady (Mhm)
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
That means I end up burnin' in Hell, scorchin' in flame
That means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'Cause right now, I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom
I've got problems, now everybody on my block's got 'em (Duh)
I'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em
Holdin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunt 'em
I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want 'em?
'Cause I ain't never went gold off one song
I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn

[Chorus]
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom



[Intro]
Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check, one-two, we recordin'?

[Verse 1]
I'm cancerous, so when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fuckin' legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out, I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out (C'mere) his blond dreads (Fuck you)
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les'
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?

[Chorus]
Now, follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat shrooms, then OD
Now, don't you want to grow up to be just like me?

[Verse 2]
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco
(We did it) My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel)
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it

[Chorus]
I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I've been with ten women who got HIV
Now, don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up to be just like me



[Verse 1]
I'm cancerous, so when I diss, you wouldn't want to answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
A hellspawn droppin' a stealth bomb
Six mics in The Source, they borrowed one from LL's arm
You beef with me, I'm a even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too funny off of twenty N-Dz
Hop on a snowboard and hit a tree harder than 'Sonny' Bono
So if I said I never get buzzed
That would mean I lie and get butt more than the president does
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I took her freakin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet
My nerves hurt and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads
Every girl I ever went out wit' has gone les'
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Talk back, fake sick, get out of school, steal from people
And don't think before you do somethin' that's illegal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Fry from an overload and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm 'posed to teach kids how to behave?

[Hook 1]
Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat 'shrooms, then O.D
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me?

[Verse 2]
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must have been 'Ron' Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the session on hold
Did 'em both and smeared blood on a white Bronco
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme-sayer
That'll spray a Aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm about as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed a main vein
With a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm fried or I'm nuts
Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
Cause when I drop this solo hit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it and dubbed over it

[Hook 2]
I came to the club drunk with a fake I.D
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I've been with ten women who got HIV
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I've got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably want to grow up to be just like me



[Intro]
Mic check, one-two, we recording?

[Verse 1]
I'm cancerous so, when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fucking legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no!) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les'
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?

[Hook 1]
Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat shrooms then OD
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me?

[Verse 2]
Me and Marcus Allen was buttfuckin' Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both then smeared blood on the white Bronco
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm running out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates
With deformative traits, a premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head-



Are you feeling good about the album at this point?
Um, that's a tough question, man. For the most part, yeah. But I don't know if I ever feel totally great about a record when I put it out. With every record that I put out, someone has literally got to come pry it from me because when I listen to my own music, I just hear flaws in it. Like I hear 'Oh fuck! I could have done this better or that better!' And I'll work it to death. Obviously if I wasn't comfortable with it, I wouldn't put it out. But from the beginning, ever since my career started, I don't know if I've ever been totally like, this is completely it.

In this last crunch, what have you been working on?
I guess you would say last minute jitters of "Fuck! Are the vocals loud enough? Can you hear what I'm saying on this part? Is the beat right? Are the vocals too loud?'" If I could not have to mix any songs and just take the actual two tracks that I rapped over and put them out, I would do that. 'Cause nothing ever feels the way as when you first did it.

But you're not changing lyrics or anything like that? It's just all mix and sound stuff? It's just sonic shit that needs to be worked out for the most part, because when I decide to keep a song, that's pretty much it. Like, if it doesn't work, I pretty much know right away, right when I get it in the car and take it home.

Rolling Stone's Review of Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP 2

So why did you dye your hair blonde again?
Um, I'll say that one was [manager Paul Rosenberg's] idea. In the earlier stages of the record and developing this shit I had thought about it. And once the songs started to come together and the picture got a little more clear of what it was gonna be, he hit me with the idea and I was like "Yo, you know I thought about that, right?" And he was like, "Well you know, why not?" And I was like "I don't know how it's gonna look. I haven't had it in how many fucking years? Five, six years." I was like, "I'm so used to it being dark," you know. So I just tried it. And I was like "Fuck it."

Did physically looking like that help you get back in the mindset or change the way you were recording?
Not really, honestly. Because I already had most of the songs. And I don't know if I'm gonna keep it like this or how long I'm gonna keep it. But for right now it is what it is. And I feel like it may fit and maybe people will understand when they get the record.

For Recovery there was a lot of rejected stuff. You recorded 100 songs or something, or at least you had 100 beats. So was there a lot of stuff thrown in the garbage pile this time around?
I feel like right now I'm probably working harder than I've ever worked in my life. And I've probably worked harder on this record than any other record aside from maybe the time period during The Eminem Show, which is a little hazy 'cause just so much shit was going on at that time. Just being so busy with The Eminem Show and doing the 8 Mile movie, and the soundtrack and the score to the movie. This is probably the equivalent of that but all focused on the record mostly.

That's crazy.
Once I had the direction that I wanted to go, and you know calling it The Marshall Mathers LP 2, obviously I knew that there might be certain expectations. Like, I wouldn't want to just call it that just for the sake of calling it that. So I wanted to make sure that I had the right songs to be able to call it that. So, a lot of recording. A lot of songs that people probably will never hear. We hit a couple of road blocks. There were songs where the beat leaked or a producer sold the beat to someone else or whatever. And just when you think you got it or you got the right amount of songs you go back and you listen and you're like, "Fuck man! I feel like it needs this or this" to paint the whole picture.

A lot of people, maybe even you, think the original is your best album.
It's probably my favorite. I think some of them are my favorites for different reasons. Hate to even say that about my own record, but I mean the first three records, I think they may have captured a time period. And then I think I pretty much probably have publicly said, you know, Encore and Relapse wasn't  it was just a different time.

You've been hard on Relapse, but Tyler, the Creator says that it's his favorite hip-hop record in years. He loves that record.
Yeah, he tells me that every time I see him. I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, but at the same time find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like "Ha ha this is funny!" You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it. Because when I got sober it was like  I've said this before  but it just was like "Oh shit! I can think straight again!" So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the ground. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it.

On Recovery, obviously the world came to you on that one. How do you feel now about that record?
I feel like that record I finally got back to where I was at maybe during The Eminem Show. Like, creatively and songwriting, I guess. I mean obviously Recovery was the first time I had ever worked with that many producers outside of our camp. Aside from working with Dre, it was like I always wanted to produce my own records, because producing is fun to me too. One of the things that was cool for me about that record was getting beats that already had choruses on them. It's kind of like a challenge to myself to be able to hear somebody else's hook and kind of interpret the words. Because my own hooks, I already know what I mean when I write them. The way that I do music is, like, regardless of what the beat is and whatever kind of appeal it may or may not have, I always want to try to go as hard lyrically as I can. So regardless if the beat feels like "Wow maybe this could be played on the radio," I'm not like, "Maybe radio would play this so I'll just wing it." Like, I always have looked at it like I want to approach every record from an MCs' aspect.

So how did you come to decide to designate this the sequel to The Marshall Mathers LP? How did you decide to make your life miserable like that?
Well here's what it is: It's not necessarily a sequel.

Okay.
As much as it is a revisitation  like this is a different time period in my life. So there's not gonna be like, continuations of every song or anything like that. To me, it's more about the vibe and the nostalgia. One of my favorite new things to do is experiment with new, older breakbeats and sounds and shit like that. You know, retro shit, and try to make it current, like bring it up to date.

So did seeking out Rick Rubin come from that direction? You were like "Why don't I go back to the source?"
Paul had mentioned to me that he might be interested in doing it and he had been talking to him and I was like, "Fuck man." Another thing with this record is that I kind of got back into producing more. On Recovery, I wanted to focus more on writing, and not have to worry abut making the beats. On Relapse I think it was mostly all Dre. So I kind of started producing again a little bit. I was kind of in the middle of that when Paul had mentioned that, and was fucking around with those kind of sounds and I don't know if that's what made Paul reach out to Rick or if Rick reached out to him. But as soon as I heard he was interested I was like, "Yo, just let me finish this up and let's go see him."

You've called Rick "Yoda"  was there still stuff to be learned from him at this point in your career?
[Yoda voice] Learning I did. Um, yeah, I mean the best part about Rick's vibe is he's very Zen-like in the sense of just "Let it happen." The weird thing about it is nine times out 10, we would know instantly if something didn't work and it didn't feel right, you know. He's almost like a coach.

He's very psychological, right?
Yeah the guy's got his shoes off. [Laughs] Working with him is the most relaxed atmosphere. He's not afraid to try anything. I kind of felt in the same way I felt, and still feel to this day, as far as like wanting to impress Dre. We talked at his house and then I think we went straight to his studio from there and we started going through breakbeats. I told him that I had started experimenting with some more retro sounds. So we just sat down and started picking shit out and I would start writing to them and next time I'd get together with him we'd start adding shit to it. The dude's got so many ideas, man. One of the coolest things about the sound that he gives you is the Rick Rubin scratches. When he fucking scratches some shit, it's almost like this perfect slop that it has on it. Not that it's off-time or anything like that, but it's just like  it's fucking weird. I don't even know how to explain it. You just know that he scratched it. I don't know if that even makes sense or not. It's like a simple scratch, like a basic kind of thing, but it's so fucking dope when you hear it. It's just, it's vintage him. And plus he knows what a lot of those sounds came from and shit.

Did he have all the old drum machines sitting around the studio?
Oh, he's got some shit in the stash. Yeah. Definitely.

So much has changed in hip-hop since you started producing  did you find the beats you were making on your own were influenced by newer stuff?
Um, not necessarily, because like I feel like I just do whatever feels right. Obviously I pay attention to what's going on and what's out and keep my finger on that pulse. But I don't ever want to be like or do like what anyone else is doing. That's no offense to anyone else.

Basically, if there are outside influences that are current, you let that come in from the other producers, but your shit is your shit.
Yeah. That's exactly it. More current-sounding shit I leave to them. And not that I don't feel like my shit sounds current, but it's not the exact same thing. And I think I've updated as well.

On the new song "Legacy" you're talking about yourself in detail as a kid. What does it take to get back in that mindset at your age?
I always try to make my music relatable to the kid who people said, "He ain't shit" or bullied or whatever. It felt like one of them self-empowerment songs. Everybody, I believe, wants to show the world that, "One day I'm gonna be this. One day I'm gonna be that." Everybody has goals, aspirations or whatever, and everybody has been at a point in their life where nobody believed in them. Like, if you haven't been kicked or whatever, if you never went through. . .

Tribulations.
Tribulations and shit like that, then you're perfect and fuck you anyways. So everybody has been in that place where they just have been counted out or not even counted. Like, "You don't matter." "Oh yeah? I'm gonna show you." So it was about incorporating that idea into the idea of my legacy  into what I leave behind when I'm gone. And I always looked up to other rappers for the words that they gave me. There's many, many songs that got me through a lot of shit.

I just love that you rhyme "Onyx" with "comics" on that song.
I don't know if anyone will get this, like this is super-nerdy, but the rhyming words in that song never change. And that's just one of the things that I do to try to challenge myself. I wanted to try to make a whole song where the rhyming words never changed.

You've praised the Beastie Boys' evolution, but it doesn't seem like you're going to have a "the disrespect for women has got to be through" moment.
I mean, listen, my sense of humor has certainly not gone away. I realize that I'm an adult, a grown-ass man, and I don't know what I'll be doing a year from now, 10 years from now, but I don't think that my tongue-in-cheekness will ever go away. I guess it's just a part of my personality. I always want to keep some type of element of fun to the music as well. If one song is darker or talking about a sad subject, I don't want to make a whole album of that, of being a downer. I don't want to make a whole album of being too uppity. You gotta try and find that right balance, and that's one of the things that the creative process was on this record as far as just experimenting. In other words, recording till I get it. And if I record 100 fucking songs and I don't have what I feel like I need yet to make the body of work, then I'm gonna keep going and keep recording.

You've written a bunch of your own hooks, and even sing some of them. Where does your sense of melody come from?
That's a good question. I would want to say that it's stemming from early hip-hop. Rappers used to fuck around all the time with melodies, at least on the shit that I grew up on. I don't know keys on a keyboard or what note this is or that is. I can only hum something. But I think it just comes from all the data that I've collected in my years of listening to music. And you know, fuck man, I think that as hip-hop started evolving, there was more melody in it, people were starting to sing hooks. Even like, early Slick Rick  [sings] "Hey young world"  those kind of things. Maybe I took it somewhere different at times, I don't know.

Maybe it's just pure instinct.
Honestly, that's probably what it is. I don't want that to sound like arrogant or nothing but I just don't know where I get that sense from, you know what I'm saying? I'm not a singer singer. I just know what's in key and what's not.

Having Kendrick Lamar on your album, did you have any concern that he might go in and try to upstage you?
I completely respect what Kendrick does and the fact that he's in the same camp, that he's on Aftermath, only made sense to me. He came to Detroit, we kicked it for a few minutes, you know, and I felt the vibe of what he's like and everything, and you know, he's a super cool and super humble dude. When we did that record, I think that was actually a week or two before he did the verse to "Control."

Is there advice you would give him at this point?
I don't know if he needs advice. He seems like he's got a really good head on his shoulders, man. He's very smart and you can tell by the way he put his album together for one. He's like a hip-hop head, man, he just loves hip-hop. And obviously the way that he did the "Control" verse, it was almost like if you get mad at him, then you might look foolish. He set it up so that you can't really get mad at a lot of that shit he said because it was what every other MC is already thinking. Or you should be thinking.

Fundamentally, do you feel like a rap god or do you feel like an underdog?
I think everything switches back and forth from hour to hour, day by day with me. That whole "Rap God" record pretty much from top to bottom is tongue in cheek. So I mean, do I want to feel like that? Maybe sometimes. Again, it goes back to everybody who competitive raps and does this for just purely the sport of it wants to be the best. Again, that's why Kendrick's verse worked so well because he only said what every rapper's already thinking, If you don't want to be the best, then why are you rapping?

[Intro]
Yeah
Same song and dance
Damn girl, everywhere I go
Same song and dance
I like the way you move, all over the globe
Same song and dance
Something about it, man
Same song and dance
In the pale moonlight, yo

[Verse 1]
I'm lookin' at ya, yeah girl, you're kinda tooken back by
The whole rapper thing, aren't ya?
Probably thinking you'll get slapped so dang hard, ya
Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?
Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster
The police constantly bugging you non-stop
I walk up on ya, Well, hello Tonya
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck
You out of gas? Do you got a flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
I got your back
Why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
And sit up front; I'm not asking, it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched, and it's a wrap
In broad day, and no mask for this attack
I heard 'em say exact opposites attract
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back
Come on

[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

[Verse 2]
The first victim I had, she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab every four-to-six months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
At Nickelodeon, flashed the little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in, son
Look, here she comes, I better pull out the big guns
Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin, hun
How 'bout a ride to rehab? Get in, cunt
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl, I'm just kidding, let me start over again, hun
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
You little wench, ya, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you, it would've already been done
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her
With 66 inches of extension cord

[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

[Verse 3]
My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played a little schoolgirl when she first
Burst upon the scene and seen that the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me, it made me mad at first
I lashed out in my songs, but what was really going on
Was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collection of skeletons, or
Footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos, and just
Climb the gate, and ring the bell, like "Hello, my love"
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you 'cause I'm feeling you Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feeling you, ooh-ooh, girl, you sexy little gal, you
Hold that pill any longer, it'll get sentimental value
C'mon toots, give me the Valium alley-oop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you
New outfit? Shit, I'll make a suit out of you, shoot
Now, show me how you move, baby, do how a-you do

[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

[Outro]
Same kicking and screaming, same crying and sobbing
Same song and dance
Same begging and pleading, same yelling and bleeding
Same song and dance
Yeah
Same song and dance
I know
Same song and dance



[Chorus]
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

[Verse 1]
I thought I had it all figured out, I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs
Which should've been a reason enough for me to get my stuff
And just leave, how come I couldn't see this shit myself?
It's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
To catch me; the minute shit was heated, she just bailed
I'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around, saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down
Try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now

[Chorus]
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

[Verse 2]
Bury my face in comic books, cause I don't wanna look
At nothing, this world's too much, I've swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would
And end it for good, just say goodbye to Hollywood
I probably should, these problems are pilin' all at once
Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
I think I'm bottomin' out, but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank God I got a little girl
And I'm a responsible father, so not a lot of good
I'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood cause I don't know how I do it
All I know is I don't wanna follow in the footsteps
Of my dad cause I hate him so bad
The worst fear that I had
Was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass
Man, if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell 'em I'm

[Chorus]
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it
For me to have this much appeal like this is sick
This is not a game, this fame, in real life, this is sick
"Publicity stunt" my ass, "conceal" my fuckin' dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whipped some ass
I love my fans, but no one ever puts a grasp
On the fact I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more than I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood or mask
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that?
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt
I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine goin' from bein' a no-one to seein'
Everything blow up, and all you did was just grow up emceein'
It's fuckin' crazy, cause all I wanted was to give Hailie
The life I never had, instead I forced us to live alienated, so I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

[Outro]
Goodbye, goodbye Hollywood (Goodbye)
Please don't cry for me (It's been real)
When I'm gone for good (This shit is not for me)
So goodbye, goodbye Hollywood (I'm not a fuckin' star)
Please don't cry for me (No way)
When I'm gone for good (I'm goin' back home)



[Intro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Heh, so I'm out the game, huh?
Yo, Dre, we ridin'?
Whatever (Ha-ha)
Well, I'm with you, homie
Okay, let's handle the small shit

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
Kick up dust, cuss 'til I slur up spit
Grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit
Corrupt, and I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick and rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to Earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep goin'
First take I make, mistakes, just keep it
No punches pulled, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit, I'll eat shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit
Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age (But what about Jermaine?)
Fuck Jermaine! He don't belong speakin' mine
Or Timbaland's name and don't think I don't read
Your little interviews and see what you're sayin'
And I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked
When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me with a bunch of little mini-you's
Runnin' around your backyard swimming pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with 10- or 11-year-olds

[Chorus: Eminem]
Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss
From a Dixie cup, if you ever mix me up
Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri
We'll rub it in, every club you're in, we'll have you blackballed
And make sure you never rap a-fuckin'-gain
Dre ain't havin' it, long as I'm here to play devil's advocate
If there was some magic shit I could wave
Over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
And buried to make sure the tradition carries on, I would
If I could only use this power for good I wouldn't, not even if I could
From the hood, and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered
And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off
Cause I know if they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch, I'm punk rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck: white-Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mil'
Or grow up to be Attila, go nuts and be a killer
And I'm something of a phenom, one puff of the chron'
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and
On top again, there's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us (C'mon!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now anybody who knows Dre knows I'm about
Fast cars and Aliz, partyin' all day
But I handled my business, cause it's work before play
Don't look for trouble, but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sendin' it your way
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
Cause this is my space, you invade it
Live to regret it, and you'll die tryna violate it
Fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dilated
Huh, like my old lady?
Cause what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean
Is two different things, depending on your mood if it swings
Think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed
I can do anything, catch a contact
And I'm gone, and I'm back, I speed write
And my loose leaf's my launchpad  And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything catch a contract
On your head, you headed West, talk shit about Dre
You better get a vest and invest in something to protect
Your head and neck  And it's back and forth
All day, like Red and Meth, I joke when I say I'm the best
In the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend
I'ma die a sudden death; five mics in The Source?
Ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath, but I'll suffocate for the respect
'Fore I breathe to collect a fuckin' check

[Chorus: Eminem]
Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

[Outro: Dr. Dre & Timbaland]
Watch your fuckin' mouth
Yo, this Timbaland, tell him I said suck my dick



[Intro: Angela Workman]
Ain't no one special, special like you
Ain't no one special, special like you
Ain't no one special, special like you
Ain't no one special, special like you
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm reminiscin' on your tenderness
And the snugglin' and teasin'
Missin' what I remember
Kissin' and huggin' and squeezin'
Buggin' and wheezin'
I'm havin' trouble when breathin'
It's even tougher when sleepin'
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm sufferin' and grievin'
For lovin' and leavin'
You're all I'm thinkin' of in the evenin'
You got my knees bucklin' and weakenin'
Thoughts of nothin' but freakin'
That I'm strugglin' to keep in
And interrupt when I'm speakin'
I got some game that I'm preparin' to run
The way your lips sparkle and they glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun
No matter what you're wearin' you stun
'Cause you're comparin' to none
I want to share in the fun, I feel a passionate lust
When I imagine it just alone at last when it's us
I see you graspin' to trust
But my intentions are good, let's leave the past in the dust
I'm not askin' to rush
And answer me immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree to repeat after me
"I love you" (I love you, baby)
'Cause I just need you to see
How much I'm eager to be your man legally wed
Your love's keepin' me fed
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down
'Cause ain't nobody like you nowhere to be found

[Hook: Angela Workman]
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby

[Verse 2: Mr. Porter]
Baby, it's all on you, it's you I call on, boo
Let's set a day up so you can fall on through
We'll take a spin in a Lexus
You can chill for dinner and breakfast
Long enough to see how this gentleman sexes
We'll start it off with caviar, Dom Prignon
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
We'll take it slow, see, nobody will hurry things
I got the Izze, the Bacardi and Hurricane
If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thang that day
It's still all right 'cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray
You're an incredible one that's rare
I bet in edible underwear
You'll look impeccable, none compare
I dream of freakin' you, the women that I'm speakin' to
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do
So, now we all set to play, only thing left to say
Is when you step away, baby, look over in the nglige

[Hook: Angela Workman]
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
Ain't no one special, special like you
Ain't no one special, special like you



Eminem:]
Yeah
It's my life
My own words I guess
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for, turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"Daddy look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
"Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby

[Hook x2:]
You look like you're in another world
But I can read your mind
How can you be so far away
Lying by my side

[Ludacris:]
Things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be
Like all these fakin' ass rappers in this industry
Talkin' bout what they got, and they ain't got a damn thang
How you own three cars, but you don't own ya own name?
Get ya business right boys, the first class is in session
Get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession
Start up ya own company, trademark the name
That's gon' run ya bout a grand so start savin' ya change
Open a bank account quick, and then follow these steps
Sign yourself to yourself and start signin' ya own checks
Hit the booth and start recording at the speed of need
Whatever gets ya juices flowin' could be speed or weed
Get it mixed and mastered, pressed up and plastered
Sell it to ya whole hood out the trunk, ya bastard
Show all the non-believers what you destined to be
And in just a couple years you could be rich like me
But I can't hold my tongue

[Hook x2:]
You look like you're in another world
But I can read your mind
How can you be so far away
Lying by my side

[Lil Wayne:]
Money to be made best believe a nigga clockin
I run it myself like a quarterback option
I pitch a 10 g's tell a bitch to go shopping
She buy herself some clothes, and she bought me back a chopper
See niggas tryna kick it, but no I don't play sucka
I'm all about my cake I'm tryna marry Betty Crocker
A package on the way you know my whip game proper
And enough for one key I see seventy thousand dollas
Now I was shootin dice, smokin on a joint
I bet with Yo Gotti, he hit five straight points
We ova here hustlin, we ova here grindin
You rap about money and nigga might sign ya
You rap about me and a nigga might find ya
Banana in ya ass with ya head right behind ya
DOPE GAME BITCH let his mamma worry bout him
You can holla at me for a fee

[Hook x4:]
You look like you're in another world
But I can read your mind
How can you be so far away
Lying by my side



[Intro: Eminem & Sly Jordan]
Like a verbal seduction when
Seduction when I tell 'em girls on the star
I don't know, man (Geh-geh-geh)
Just feels like we're a lot different (Right now)
(Girls on the star) It kinda feels like (Like a verbal seduction when)
I'm on a whole different page right now than you (Girls on the star)
It feels strange, but umm (Girls on the star)
I guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like...

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I feel like I'm morphin' into somethin' that's so incredible
That I'm dwarfin' all competitors
Better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, endorphins I effect
Your self-esteem shatters as dialect comes blastin' out your deck
She loves me, such passion, you'd expect
This sort of reaction from her, yet you strong-arm
You're fuckin' corny, you try to turn your charm on
'Cause you just think you're Bishop the Don Juan
But if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like Ed Lover, "C'mon, son!"
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like, "She's fuckin' with dude, she wants some"
Homeboy, you better get a clue
She's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do?
How you expect her to act in the sack when she's closin' her eyes
Fantasizin' of diggin' her nails in my back to this track?

[Chorus: Eminem & Sly Jordan]
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
She's sittin' there gettin' liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you
Than to count the things that are
There's a seven-disc CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot, and you're not  aww!
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet: a star
And I'm not about to sit back
And just keep rhymin' one syllable  naw!
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'Cause they're just not good enough, but I'm not givin' up
'Til I get my respect and I won't stop 'til I get enough
'Cause I'm not livin' up to my own expectations (Aww!)
That hater alarm is soundin' off
And Obama took the bomb from my name (Aww!)
So quit cryin' that I took your dame, homie, she's my dame (Aww!)
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that I'm not on my game, boy
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank, boy
But you got a hard-on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man, I can't call it

[Chorus: Eminem & Sly Jordan]
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's like we're playin' lyrical tug of war with your ear
You hear it, girl? Come here
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear
While I freak this world premiere
Seducin' her, loosen up
With a little freestyle that'll wait, am I losin' ya?
Am I makin' you look bad? Well, I got news for ya
Homie, you losin' her
Oh wait, she don't like when I spit it fast
Am I tryin' to show how? Let me slow it down some
It's still gonna be a blow-out
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
If you can save any of it, punk, but none of it's fuckin' with me
Prick, you really feelin' that bullshit?
You think you killin' them syllables? Quit
Playin', these beats ain't nothin' to fool with
They call me Fire Marshall: I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just awe-struck
She's love-stricken, she's got her jaw stuck
From suckin' my dick... aw, fuck

[Chorus: Eminem & Sly Jordan]
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)



[Eminem]
What's up with everybody beefin'
Everybody seem like they wanna beef
You know what I'm saying?
Everybody beefin' with everybody
This shit is crazy

[Verse 1: Dogmatic]
This is a bomb scare, fires on your hair
Terrorists live here, but I don't care
I'm making pot holes when I stomp, so don't stare
I stop to stomp competiton, with both fair
How dare, little soldier at ease
We shake down these streets, like Parkinson's Disease
We parking the road trees, plus load the weapons
Everything to six shooters, to high tech ones
If a green beans things, to my suggestion
Burn a big whole in your belly, like indigestion
With one question, who the fuck is Dogmatic
An underground nigga but this nigga's above average
It's serious! who can understand what I'm saying?
Yo Slim, tell them niggas (Eminem: We ain't playing!)
It's like you open a can of worms or smoked yams
I got bloody hands and burners that make you dance!

[Hook: Eminem]
This shit is serious! Do you really want beef
Do you really wanna end up, missing yo front teeth
And see yo family, getting smoked like a blunt leaf
And wrapped up in a zip-lock bag, like lunch meat
This shit is serious! Do you really want beef
Do you really wanna end up, missing yo front teeth
And see yo family, getting smoked like a blunt leaf
And wrapped up in a zip-lock bag, like lunch meat
This shit is serious!

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
I'm the only one your bitch let touch her
Type a brother that'll, fuck yo mother, wit a fishnet rubber
I'mma misfit slash, nitwit
I love to put up biscuts, straight to a niggas lips, it'll fit
A biligerent and rowdy fellow
I'll dump yo body, and still fly away to Maui, on a teller
When it comes to beefin', it ain't no explain'
I'll change ya lauguage, wit a stainless
I'll contain, wit a name which to make you famous
I'mma deranged pit, I'll bend you till ya back touch ya anus
Don't ever take me to court, I'll whack the plantiff
Then beat the fuck out the baliff
A heinous, miscellaneous, nigga never miss, when the AK lift
I paint ya face wit, any weapon, just like "The Matrix"
They ain't steppin', don't even say shit
You heard about the bodies in my basement, you joinin' them, face it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Proof]
Laugh indictive, like Kim lipstick, and get a nose bleed
My blow speed, is like my hands working ten stick shifts
Captain ask, to stick my finger in the barrel of a Mac 10
And snatching the driver out the black Benz
Smashing his contact lens, my life start when his contract ends
"Go kiss-and-tell, and contact Kim!"
Let's be factually, actually, y'all ain't after me
Got (???) wit +Regis+, y'all beef is without the +Kathy Lee+
Told y'all my battlery, and go to war happily
How you gon' call my bluff, when you scared to send a fax to me
My factulty guns drawn, one wrong move dudey
And it's too heads on ya body, into a gangster movie
For lot being real, scared to pop wit the steel
It got skeletons in my house, every closet is filled
Now how does it feel, with this Baretta to ya dome
And to know that ya mom's know, that you was never coming home

[Hook] w/ Ab-libs

[Outro: Eminem]
You know what I'm sayin'
You want beef, we taking it to yo face
Fuck it, Dirty Dozen, Slim Shady
D-12, this shit is serious!



[Intro: Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
You ready to get this shit started or what?
Aight, well I brought some friends with me too

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Now I ain't back just for the sake of just saying I'm back
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
Out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturin'
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurrin'
Whoa-oh, I can't see shit, my words get to slurrin'
Uh-oh! You can call me R. Kelly now, you're in
Trouble! What's occurring befo', after, and during the show
Has no bearing on the bad news I'm bearing, whoa
What is it, wordplay? No, I'm pushing you out the do'
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fucking feet 'til you get to squishing a ho
It's pandemonium, standing o when you see him, oh
Damn baby you look good, you're giving me wood
You should pull over like a sweatshirt with a hood
It's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both
Break bread while I'm copping over this game to pinch a loaf
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?
Who claims to be spitting the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed
In other words I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
Destroyed the front end
Deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed
Came back an hour after the accident
And bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!
So stop faking the funk and start shaking your ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the Caucasian of rap
And Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazing than that?
Slut, answer me that, Royce where you at?

[Verse 2: Royce da 59]
I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers I pry apart you
Lump on your head designed by a bar stool
Designed by a cartoon
Before I need to be hired, Jimmy I'll fire Marshall
The 9 tucked against the lining
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down
Like y'all are a couple 69ing
It's like Rick James is shooting up your house, nigga!
{rapid gunfire} FUCK YO' COUCH NIGGA!
You're screaming, "Fuck the world!" with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shoving my dick in a hole in the mud
My bitch know I'm perfectly fit for murder
Because I murdered her, so you can call me
Nickel to O.J. to Glove
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns
Blow your brains on your opposite ear
And ask you how your brain sounds
Bad, Evil, we go Alfred E. Neumann mad cerebral
You on your last burrito!
(What that mean Nickel?) It's a wrap if you eating
Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse on FIRE, nobody touching that
Good day and good night, Ortiz, yo, where the FUCK you at?

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
I'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light-years
Ahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at a nightmare
Where my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares
I harbor the art of my nice wear
It's type weird 'cause that made me hotter than my dear
Uncle Al's breath after polishing off his ninth beer
Homie chill, listen, I swear
I'm God, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be?
Just waiting to be hooked to IV as Mumm-Ra's
Well, when you look at my pee
And this joint no exception, so just point a direction
And record the pig's oink when I rip his intestine
This isn't just an infection
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arose
After they did an inspection, what I exhibit
Seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Edimminem
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgusting hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?

[Verse 4: Crooked I]
I'm right here letting the shotty pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
Get your mommy knocked
And your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped
I take your life to the ninth inning
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winning
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
Man, all the bitches holla - they wanna drop my britches
Then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala
I ball like Iguodala
I bear more arms than 6 koalas
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah
Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun
I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam!
Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flying
We do it to try to do without tryin
(Slaughterhouse!) 'Cause to it's us it's so easy
Where's Jumpoff Joe Beezy?

[Verse 1]
Comin' to you live at Shade 45 Invasion
The only radio station that plays in rotation
The Shady the slash with the Aftermath with the little Jay on occasion
Maybe you may hear some Jada mixed with a plate of some D Block
Splash of 2Pac
One being that we don't cater cause we gonna play the fuck
Outta whatever we want this is Shady
And we gonna pump, pump the fuck out our own shit
From 50, Obie, Twizzy, Stat Quo
And we won't quit fuckin' you up
And we can keep sayin' fuckin' you up
Even till the FCC sayin' shut this dude up
Duck tape a his mouth a do somethin'
Quick fucka do fuck poppa do pop
Skippy dippy pop shit bitch asshole you son of a bitch! Chinga tu madre!
I start drama all day hemm delala
Comin' across your scanners it's the brand new station
Shade 45, motherfuckin' Slim Shady bitch and Green Lantern
Shady in the place to be, see
And it takes what I got to rock the mic right
And that was a freestyle too bitch so suck my dick if you do not like



[Intro / Spoken: Eminem]
Yeah!
God damn!
Feels like a long time don't it?
Did you miss us?
We missed you!
Ha!
Shady Narcotics
It's the Re-Up
Pussies!
And we're back
Myself
D12
50 Cent
Obie Trice
Stat Quo
And I would also like to introduce
The two newest members of the family
One goes by the name of Bobby Creek
The other goes by the name of Ca$his, from Orange County
And I think it's about time we just cut the bullshit, let's go!



[Verse]
I'm liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought
I disgust you like dialogue from The Shop to The Wired Frog
Night club, shit, I was taught
If your CD's on fire you had to put it out yourself like Highland Park
No fire department, so you might not hear sirens at all
But don't be alarmed if I sound off
Something just ain't right with me, dog
A martyr on a private charter, whose life could be harder?
Widely regarded highly? Bite me, sweetheart
I'm slightly retarded, but tonight I'm startin'
Shit, I'm feeling self righteous and might just hop in a mosh pit
On some Mike Tyson and Pac shit
Lookin' to box with anybody, disorderly conduct
I'll fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith
Fan of The LOX, bananas, manic, I'm going in shock
Frantic, I'm trapped in a closet
Panic attack 'cause I'm claustrophobic
No, faggot, I mean I can't maneuver for movement
'Cause I have no room for improvement
I'm practically squashed, compacted and boxed in
Toxic, cans of arsenic, flammable bars, examine the content
Bar exam, start of insanity
Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson
Animal snarls, cannibal jaws
Shark mandibles, lambs to the slaughter
Looking skantless as Hannibal's stalking
Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets
(Whistle) Black out, Zach Galifianakis
Gallons of Vodka, but that gal has some knockers
I bet'cha they ring a bell when I come back and I'm conscious
What happened, doc? I passed out again
Alcohol's making me break into vacant's naked
Stolen Magnavox and bag of rocks in back of a Datsun
Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics
Too close to the StairMaster
Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it
Woke up shortly thereafter, hungover
No underwear, grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it
Air Maxes in my closet, preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich
And the cross stitching is a cross mixing
Of a rhinoceros, possum skin, giraffe and a dolphin
Fin, cotton Dockers, OshKoshes, drop crotches
Swatch watches and sneakers match with the parkas
But it's like being overstaffed at a boxing gym
With all these trainers, but I don't have any boxers
And I'm standing here naked, hangover, still wasted
Like paper you write raps on, obnoxious
Yo, why does it always sound like I'm grabbing my nostrils?
Fuck that, I'll battle 'em all, I'll battle a mall
Ill stand there and yell that at a wall
'Til the mannequin dolls scatter and the inanimate objects
That I'm battering all shatter and fall
'Cause I hear the track and I'm starting to get fucking amped
I'm a spark plug, I'm like the car with the cables
Hooked up to my fucking back, I'm a Duracell
But I sure as hell got it backwards 'cause y'all get jumped
And I'll catch the battery charge, but
I got a hunch like your back when it's arching
When I start attacking your squadron
You'll feel like MasterCard when I'm charging
So take a swipe at me, I'm coming straight at you
Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers
So get the sack like Wisconsin
That's nutbag that I'm talking, who am I kidding?
You faggots are all gonna do my bidding
Don't get dragged to the auction
Neiman Marcus, bags of Vuitton and all
I'll push a bitch into oncoming traffic, just watch this
Stretched, tinted, black sedan my ass
See how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave
In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping
Affable guy next door's laughable
My next whore's gonna have mechanical arms
That'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor
No emotion, hence I guess this sick prick dies hard
I got a Magic Johnson
It's like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
If Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out
Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me
I laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me
Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around
And all I see is Paulie Malignaggi, she Slaughterhouse in a blouse
And Madonna with mud on her, God dammit I am a misogynist
I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster, throw her off a balcony
Just so happens she's fond of algae
'Cause now she faceplants on the concrete
Complete lack of responsibility
Half you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit
Shit, you fags couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop
But I let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy
Klepto, I'm back to rip shop up, but my thing is this now
Five-finger discount
Been rapping so long I've been killing this shit, it's easy
Kidnapping your mom 'cause I'm still in this bitch, thievery
Ransom for JonBent Ramsey, and Chandra Levy, and Gary Condit
("Em") Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde
I might relapse, get on some bullshit
Perhaps I'll launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson
Macklemore, Mac Miller and Asher Roth
And have some back and forths
And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamar's "Control" verse
And perform "Fack" in concert ["Fack" plays]
Yo, I put that shit on a greatest hits album
Now that was awesome
It takes some massive balls to do some shit like that
Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like (I'll stick around)
And put up with my crap so long for, what's the attraction, mama?
Is it the fact that I'm a walking, talking, actual quadruple entendre
Or the pointy nose that's pointing at you, mama?
Who knows at this point, it's always poking so na-ah
Still get along with this voice 'cause that's the "Monster"
So do-si-do with the (na-ah) sociopath
Everyone who knows me knows that
What they don't know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio
(Na-ah) She loves the way I lie
Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow
Pathological liar, oh, why am I such an asshole
That my disguise is pants, but they on fire
So am I-a, (Wu) Cappadonna, cut the track off
Sabotage Christmas, crap in your stocking
I'm wrapping up all the presents
In fucking camouflage so you can't even find 'em
Jack Santa Claus, snap Rudolph's antlers off
Wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him
Blowing a head gasket at Bed, Bath and Beyond
Put the basket back all the bath salt packets are gone, I
Know you really tired of me sampling Billy Squier
But classic rock acid rap is the genre
Got Slash on guitar, splash of Bizarre, Thrasher, and Aerosmith
And I'm a spectacular archer, feed Count Dracula, Chocula
Godzilla, half dragon and Bob Dylan, bandwagoners
I'm kicking the damn stragglers off and I'm strangling 'em
Smack Kim Basinger on her ass in the sauna



[Intro: Eminem & Nate Dogg]
Whoo! Shady, Aftermath
(Look at that bitch!)
(Holy shit, hey!)
There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk, get fucked up
Hit the strip club, don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit-faceted
Pasted, plastered  puke, drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg in to sing some shit

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' fo' a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
(Now) Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and now finish
Yeah, me and Nate D-O Double-G
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna, finna

[Bridge 2: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
We 'bout have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
Some girls, they act retarded (Man, I told you!)
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no

[Verse 4: Nate Dogg with Eminem]
(Now) Look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now, I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
(Now) Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' fo' a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up

[Outro: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control
God!
I ain't leavin' without you, bitch!
Comin' home with me!
And my boy, and his boy  and his boy, and his girl
Ha-ha, Nate Dogg!



[Verse 1: Eminem]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits
Live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away



[Instrumental]



[Verse One: Eminem]
I'm a pacifist, unless there's ass to kick
It'll be tragic miss, If I don't fuck you bitch
You can take the dick you little cunt
Lick it than pass it like a blunt
But I'm sober now I'm done with drugs
That was the last chapter this is the next one
My place in the game is big, son
I'm somewhere between God, Godzilla, and King Kong
A Monster, yeah like his dick is
They say I'm hung like a bear, so run, run bitches
The chainsaw can give you staple stitches
If your unfaithful, just kill your wife than rape your mistress
And if that don't work your a fucking retard
I'm sick of playing games, I'm here for revenge, Dee Barnes
Slapping up Dre for what he start-
Ed, long time ago and it left him scarred

[Hook: Eminem] x2
Everybody knows I'm crazy
This game isn't gonna change me
There's nothing else to say, see
You already know I'm Shady

[Verse Two: Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
I'm assuming you don't want to battle
That will be your dying day
Into your house bullets will rattle
You just cannot win this fray
Don't believe me ask Ray (Cornrows)
(I heard he thinks he's gangsta), but he's really not though
(so don't fuck with Slim), that's the goal
(he'll burn your house down), and relocate you to the motorhomes
Holdin' pullin' moldin' chrome
Oldest, dopest, grossest flow
Killer, father, loving home
Family jealous of all this gold
Everybody wants a million from Shady
Even the goddamn motherfuckers who hate me
But I stays crazy, and sprayz AKs at babys
Me and Drezy (Yeah Slim your Shady)

[Hook 2: Eminem & (Dr. Dre)] x2
Mothefucker I told you I was (crazy)
The game done helped (shape me)
The only thing left to (say b)
Is hey (Slim your Shady)


[Outro: Eminem]
Relapse 2 mothafuckas
Fuck you and your mothas
Dre grab the gat *gunshots*



[Skit: Slim Shady, Eminem]

"Eminem..."
"No..."
"Eminem!"
"No..."
"Hahaha. Wake the fuck up, motherfucker."
"What do you want from me?!"
"Hahahaha. Remember me?"
"I killed you!"
"You thought I was dead, didn't you?"
"What do you want from me?!"
"I'm alive..."
"Oh, God..."
"Get up."
"No."
"Get up and look in the mirror."
"I don't want to!"
"Look in the mirror, it's just a reflection. Haha"
"Leave me alone!!!"
"Look in the mirror! You're nothing! You're nothing without me! Look in the motherfucking mirror!"
"Leave me alone!!! Leave me the fuck alone!!!"
[Eminem punches the mirror, breaking it.]

[Low, Down, Dirty being scratched.]



[Verse One: Eminem]

[Eminem & Brenda]
(Yo) Brenda (Brenda's not here)
Brenda's not there? (No) It sounds like you?
You know what? You didn't think I knew, did you?
(I, you know-) You told me you didn't do this shit
This Brenda, right? Don't play games with me, girl!
This Brenda, right? You said you didn't do it, bitch!
(Who are you, what you want?) What are you- I want Bren-
This ain't Brenda? (No, motherfucker, it ain't Brenda)
Yo, don't-don't-don't call me a motherfucker, bitch
I swear to God, I come up there and pop all you fucking sluts
I told you Brenda, don't be fuckin' round on me
You fuckin' bitch! I told you!
"Aw, I don't do it, I don't do it!"
You motherfucking slut, I'll kill you, bitch!
I break your motherfucking neck
(You getting mad at me, I'm not Brenda)
Yo, don't play games with me, girl!
Don't play ga- When you come home tonight
I swear to God, yo, all of your shit will be outside!
You hear me girl?! I ain't playing with you no more!
I bought you everythi- "I saw yoooou, walking in the way"
You know what I'm saying, girl?!
I don't play that shit! (Crack kills, you know)
I don't play that shit, crack?! (Crack kills)
I ain't in no crack, bitch, this Slim motherfucking Shady
You understand me?



[Roger & Skylar]
Skylar Montgomery?
What do you want from me, Roger?
I know it was you all along messing around with my dear Veronica
Wait a minute, you hold it right there
Me and that woman love each other
Love? What do you know of love?
We were destined to be together
I met her on the beach
Are you out to destroy me?
No, Roger, that's not what I want to do
I love her, and we're gonna be together
Never



[Intro]
Yeah, haha, you feel that, baby?
Yeah, I feel it too, damn
You know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together
You see, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was, am I?

[Verse 1]
Im the American Dream
Im the definiton of white trash ballin
Im right back on 'em with a *err-chick-err, chicka-chick*
I cant call it, same shit, different toilet
Oh, you got a nice ass, darling
Cant wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin? You take me for a friend?
Let me tell you the whole story of Shadys origin
Youll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again
Now, it all started with my father
I mustve got my pimpin' genes from him
The way he left my momma
Im a rolling stone, just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage with me, baby, Ill make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as
Me, Im as calm as the breeze
Im the bees knees, his legs, and his arms
I'm a superstar, girl, Im ready for you, mama
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas?

[Chorus]
I'm so bad, Im so good that Im so bad
I guarantee Ill be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad, Im so good that Im so bad
I guarantee Ill be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

[Verse 2]
I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuervo
First Ill kiss your navel, work my way down
Baby, you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find somethin' more stable
I told you I ain't foolin' from the gate
This ain't the first day of April
But thank you for stayin', April
I'ma make you learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phony, little fishy and sissy fake Gs
Skip over the "huggy bear," and all the "kissy face," please
Initiate phase three, missy, now service me
Take another shot of Jger, shakin' so nervously
Take your time, baby, oh, youre the bomb, baby
Oh, youre doing that even better than your mom, lady
I told you why Im Shady, you didn't listen now, did ya?
Relax, woman, you know that Im only kiddin' with ya
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped, but I didn't hit ya
I think youre finally startin' to get the picture, Im just...

[Chorus]
I'm so bad, Im so good that Im so bad
I guarantee Ill be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad, Im so good that Im so bad
I guarantee Ill be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

[Bridge]
Call me dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
Call me dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go
Cause I'm on to the next girl
And the next girl I kind of like, oh

[Verse 3]
I got you caught up in the rapture, make you recapture
The feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad, you're
Sweatin', but if Im what you wanted
Whyd you panic when I grabbed ya?
Girl, don't be so frantic, Im just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of somethin' that's so organic
You cant ignore it, so don't, just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, lets get to camcordin'
Damn, shawty, I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on the napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back
And throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blind that
You couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a line-up
So stop at the store, pick a pint up
Let's get the pineapple Schnapps going, no one will knock
Cause I'ma hang a sign up saying "Don't Disturb"
Shawty, Im so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words?

[Chorus]
I'm so bad, Im so good that Im so bad
I guarantee Ill be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad, Im so good that Im so bad
I guarantee Ill be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

[Bridge]
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go
Cause I am on to the next girl
And the next girl I kind of like, oh

[Chorus]
I'm so bad, Im so good that Im so bad
I guarantee Ill be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad, Im so good that Im so bad
I guarantee Ill be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

Lightyears ahead of you



[Intro]
I own a mansion but live in a house
A king-size bed but I sleep on the couch
I'm Mr. Brightside, glass is half-full
But my tank's half empty, gasket just blew

[Verse 1]
This always happens
Thirty minutes from home, gotta lay a log cabin
Only option I have's McDonalds's bathroom
In a public stall, droppin' a football
So every time someone walks in the john, I get maddened
"Shady, what up?" What? Come on, man, I'm crappin'
And you're askin' for my goddamn autograph on a napkin?
Oh, that's odd, I just happened
To run out of tissue, yeah, hand me that
On second thought I'd be glad then
"Thanks, dawg! Name's Todd, a big fan."
I wiped my ass with it
Crumbled it up in a wad and threw it back and
Told him: "Todd, you're the shit," when's all of this crap end?
Can't pump my gas without causing an accident
Pump my gas, cut my grass, I can't take out the fuckin' trash
Without someone passin' through my sub, harassin'
I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow than bask sufferin' succotash
But the ant-acid, it gives my stomach gas
When I mix my corn with my fuckin' mashed
Potatoes, so what? Ho, kiss my country bumpkin ass!
Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is upper class?
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper
Tupperware in the cupboard, plasticware up the ass
Stuck in the pastiPod, what the fuck is that?
B-Boy to the core, mule, I'm as stubborn as

[Chorus]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on the city that made me
And (life's been good to me so far)

[Verse 2]
They call me classless, I heard that, I second and third that
Don't know what the fuck I'd be doin' if it weren't rap
Probably be a giant turd sack
But I blew, never turned back
Turned 40 and still sagteenagers act more fuckin' mature, Jack
Fuck you gonna say to me? I leave on my own terms, asshole
I'm goin' berzerk, my nerves are bad
But I love the perks my work has
I get to meet famous people, look at her dag
Her nylons are ran, her skirt's snagged
And I heard she drag-races, *burp* swag
Tuck in my Hanes shirt tag
You're Danica Patrick (Yeah?) word, skag
We'd be the perfect match
'Cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
My apologies, no disrespect to technology
But what the heck is all of these buttons?
You expect me to sit here and learn that?
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda?
Be an expert at computers?
I'd rather be an Encyclopedia Britannica, hell with
PlayStation, I'm still on my first man on some Zelda
Nintendo, bitch! Run, jump, punch, stab, and I melt the
Mozzarella on my spaghetti
Put in on bread, make a sandwich with Welch's, and belch
They say this spray butter is bad for my health, but
I think this poor white trash from the trailer
Jed Clampett, Fred Sanford, and welfare
Mentality helps to keep me grounded
That's why I never take full advantage of wealth, I
Managed to dwell within these parameters
Still crammin' the shelves full of Hamburger Helper
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt, a
Creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves, goddamn it, to hell, I
Can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I could yell, the
Other day, someone got all elaborate
And stuck a head from a fuckin' dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger Kingthey spit on my onion rings
I think my karma is catchin' up with me

[Chorus]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on the city that made me
And (life's been good to me so far)

[Bridge]
Got friends on Facebook all over the world
Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
So, I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque
I'd hang it up, but the frame is all cracked

[Verse 3]
I'm tryin' to be low-key, hopefully nobody notices me
In produce, hunched over, giant nosebleed
Ogre style as I mosey over to the frozen aisle
By the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Embarrassed, I just did Comerica with Hova
The show's over, I'm hidin' in Kroger, buyin' groceries
He just had front-row seats
Told me to sign this poster, then insults me
"Wow! Up close didn't know you had crow's feet!"
I'm in the crossroads, lost, still shoppin' at Costco's
Sloppy Joe's, bulk waffles
Got caught picking my nose (agh!)
Look over, see these two hot hoes
Finger still up one of my nostrils
Right next to 'em, stuck at the light, the fuckin' shit's
Takin' forever to change, it's stuck, these bitches are lovin' it
Rubbin' it in, chucklin', couldn't do nothin'
Play it off, "What you bumpin'?"
"Trunk Muzik, Yelawolf's better," fuckin' bitch!
They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
The pressure, they want me to follow up with
Another one, after Recovery was so highly coveted
But what good is a fuckin' recovery if I fumble it?
'Cause I'ma drop the ball if I don't get a grip
Hoppin' out shrubbery on you sons of bitches
Wrong subdivision to fuck with, bitch
Quit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids
I love my city, but you pushed me to the limitwhat a pity!
The shit I complain about
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's rainin' out
Kool-Aid stain on the couch, I'll never get it out
But bitch, I got an elevator in my house
Ants and a mouseI'm livin' the dream!

[Chorus]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on the city that made me
And (life's been good to me so far)



[Intro]
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier (la-de-dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah)
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo...

[Verse 1]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect, if it meant
Life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if it's true
If it's youwhat you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?
In confrontation, ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it; if you conceal it, reveal it
Bein' reasonable'll leave you full of bullets, pull it, squeeze it
'Til it's empty; tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Verse 2]
I love pissin' you off, gets me off
Like my lawyers when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do, bitch, it's news
Pistol-whippin' motherfuckin' bouncers 6'2"
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Runnin' and duckin' out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not, 'cause I'm a

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Verse 3]
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord, have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity, I'm a

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Outro]
Yo, left, yo, left, yo, left, right, left
Yo, left, yo, left, yo, left, right, left
Yo, left, yo, left, yo, left, right, left
Yo, left, yo, left, yo, left, right, left



[Verse]
Kick a hypest lyric every time I run up on a track
You know I'm not wack
You have to step back
'Cause if you don't I'll prove that I'm the mac
Every time I kick a lyric tune it to two-ninety-five
Yo', do you find me live?
If you don't then that's all right, 'cause I'll just grab the microphone
And I just got to get so hype when I speak in a hyper tone
There's so many styles I might get thrown
And here's a place where I like to roam
And all the girls that I like to bone
Have the big butts, no they don't, 'cause I don't like that nigga shit
I'm just here to make a bigger hit
When I be kickin' the hypest dopest rhymes
Just say that Eminem is the best MC in of all times



[Intro]
You fuckin' groupie
Pick up the goddamn phone

[Verse 1]
Bitch, where the fuck were you Tuesday? With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio, bitch, what'd you do? Screw Dre?
You went there lookin' for me? Boo, that excuse is too lame
Keep playin' me, you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg
You fake, lyin' slut, you never told me you knew Drake
And Lupe? You wanna loose two legs?
You tryin' to flip this on me? If I spent more time with you, you say
"Okay, yeah, and I'm coo-coo, eh?"  Well, screw you
And I'll be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, fourthDre, Drake, Lupeoohm, touch
You were too two-faced for me
Thought you was my number one true-blue ace
But you ain't and I can't see you when you make that wittle boo-boo face
'Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo, you make my fuckin' Bluetooth ache
You're feeling blue? Too late, go smurf yourself
You make me wanna smurf and puke blue Kool Aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate

[Chorus]
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead?
I would feel so much, much better

[Verse 2]
Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway tryna get some time alone and just think
'Til the cops pulled me over, but they let me go, 'cause I told 'em
I'm only drivin' drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink
I'm back on my fuck hoes, with a whole new hatred for blondes
But bias? I hate all bitches the same, baby, come on!
Excuse the pun, but bitch is such a broad statement, and I'm
Channelin' my anger through every single station that's on!
'Cause a woman broke my he-art, I say, "he-art"
'Cause she ripped it in two pa-arts and threw it in the garbage
Who do you think you a-are? Bitch, guess it's time for me to get the dust off
And pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L-word again
I lo-lo-lo-lo lesbian!
Aaahhh! I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, my life'd be so much better if you just

[Chorus]
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead?
I would feel so much, much better

[Bridge]
'Cause you told me
You'd love me
Forever
Bitch, that was a lie
Now I never
Wanted someone to die
So bad in my fuckin' life
But fuck it, theres other fish in the sea

[Verse 3]
And I'ma have a whale of a time
Bein' a single sailor for the night, bitch, on a scale of
One to ten, shit, I must be the Holy Grail of
Catches, ho, I got an Oscar attached to my fuckin' name (De La)
I might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor-made
For me, say fuck it, kick some shots back, get hammered, and nail her
These bitches tryin' to get attached, but they're failin' to latch onto the tail of
My bumper, they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched, yeah, I'm rich as a bitch
But bitches ain't shit, I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch, you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me: that's what I call pitchin' a bitch
That's why I'm swingin' at this chicks on-site
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul, but my dick's on strike
So all that love shit is null and void, bitch, I'm a droid
I avoid Cupid, stupid! Wasn't for blow jobs, you'd be unemployed
Oye-yoy-yoy, man-oh-man, your boy-boy-boy's
Gettin' sick of these girls-girls-girls, oink-oink-oink
You fuckin' pigs, all you're good for is doink-doink-doink
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of 'em, I need a machine gun
I'll take 'em all out, I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, have a heart attack and just
Drop dead, and I'ma throw a fuckin' party after this, 'cause yes

[Chorus]
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead (I hate you)
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head (You made me like this way)
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead? (Bitch)
I would feel so much, much better

[Outro]
I'm just playin', bitch
You know I love you



[Verse 1: Eminem]
We touch, I feel a rush; we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible: gained my trust
Don't play games, it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over, cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya
What it's like to hurt, cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil  spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be like
Tryin' to start over, I got a hole in my heart
But some kind of emotional roller coaster
Is something I won't go on
So you toy with my emotions, so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya
Wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova, and I'm a

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you, right at you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you, I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one? And then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled on to you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake, cause I'm a

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you, right at you

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So, after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

[Bridge: Eminem]
And I would've done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, cause I'm a

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you, without you



[Intro: Eminem]
If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say (say)
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road
And now I'm back, sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up where I started from

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
I never would've thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know, between us we was like mates of soul
Nothin' could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type I chose
'Til more shows, haunted you nights, I suppose
That's how it go: with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinnin', then you invite that Obie's cold?
But bitches, they gon' talk; niggas, they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire, and

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducin' you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall, I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'da even knew that? Who woulda even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them goddamn darts at me?
It's true that I got shot in the heart, but when someone seems
Too good to be true, they usually are, but see
When you're in it, it's too hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life-altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)

[Interlude: Stat Quo]
Ha ha, yeah right, bitch
Spend some time on my dick

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
In most cases, Stat's attitude is "Fuck a bitch!" (Fuck a bitch!)
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch (Fuck a bitch!)
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in pub-a-lic
We sufferin' because of this (Because of this)
Shawty on some whole 'nother other shit (Other shit)
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feedin' you the best of me, I should've fed you piss (Should've fed you piss)
We started off closer than close
But who could've predicted to know
Your trifling ways woulda stopped our growth?
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself: "Do I love these hoes?"  Nope!

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
(Yeah) Em introduced us: "50, this is Tanya. Tanya, this is 50."
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said, "You have very nice lips."
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan, on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist, too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an aspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit?
Ha-ha

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

[Intro: Eminem]
People, it feels so good to be back!
Ladies and gentleman
Introducing the new and improved you-know-who

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Never been the type to bend or budge
The wrong button to push, no friend of Bush
I'm the centerpiece, you're a Maltese
I'm a pitbull off his leash, all this peace talk can cease
All these people I had to leave in limbo
I'm back now, I've come to release this info
I'll be brief, and let me just keep shit simple
Can-I-Bitch don't want no beef with Slim, no!
Not even on my radar
So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off?
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos
From sance to sance, aw-a-aw-ch-a-aw

[Chorus: Eminem]
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yeah, let your hair down to the track, yeah, kick on back (Boo!)
The boogie monster of rap, yeah, the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the Senate's face and push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say somethin'
You might not like, this white hot light
That I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt
Oh no, I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no, I won't leave, won't go nowhere
Do-si-do, oh, yo, ho, hello there!
Oh yeah, don't think I won't go there
Go to Beirut and do a show there (Haha!)
Yeah, you laugh 'til your mothafuckin' ass gets drafted
While you're at band-camp thinkin' that crap can't happen
'Til you fuck around, get an Anthrax napkin
Inside a package, wrapped in Saran Wrap wrappin'
Open the plastic and then you stand back, gaspin'
Fuckin' assassins hijackin' Amtraks, crashin'
All this terror, America demands action
Next thing you know, you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'
To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy
You just a baby gettin' recruited at 18
You're on a plane now, eatin' their food and their baked beans
I'm 28, they gon' take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane or insane crazy?
When I say "Hussein," you say "Shady"
My views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait
Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me!

[Chorus: Eminem]
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin' boosts me more or suits me beautifully
There's nothin' you can do to mestab me, shoot at me! (Woo-hoo!)
Psychotic, hypnotic product, I got the antibiotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada-yada
God, I talk a lot of hem-de-lay-la-la-la
Oochie-walla-walla, um-da-dah-da-dah-da, but you gotta-gotta
Keep movin', there's more music to make
Keep makin' new shit, produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock and Hennessy, thug like I'm 'Pac, on my enemies
On your knees, got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be
Hungry like a fuckin' younger me
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free
Yeah, buddy, laugh! It's funny: I have the money
To have you killed by somebody who has nothin'
I'm past bluffin', pass the K-Y
Let's get ready for some intense serious ass-fucking!

[Chorus: Eminem]
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

[Outro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Dr. Dre wants to square dance with me
Nasty Nas wants to square dance with me
X to the Z wants to square dance with me
Busta Rhymes wants to square dance with me
Can-i-bitch won't square dance with me
Fan-a-bitch won't square dance with me
Canada-bis don't want no parts of me
Dirty Dozen wants to square dance with you
Yeeehawww! Wee!

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 2: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, StanP.S.: We should be together too

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 3: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no wordI don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers nowI'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been togetherthink about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slimshut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her upSee? I ain't like you
Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgothow am I supposed to send this shit out?!

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph
For your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin'
Off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name wasit was you, damn

In a recent sit-down with MTV News Tim Kash, 50 laughed off recent rumors that Em  who has all but disappeared from the public eye in recent years  has been packing on the pounds, and that as a result of his weight gain, has become a recluse, venturing out of his Detroit-area mansion only to gorge himself on meals from Taco Bell and Outback Steakhouse. The G-Unit captain insisted that fans are going to be seeing a slim-and-trim Eminem real soon.

Em is in shape right now. He looks good. I seen him in Detroit. Hes gonna look real good when you see him return, Fif laughed. Hes in shape right now.

The rapper has been on hiatus ever since releasing his official Shady Records mixtape, Eminem Presents the Re-Up, in December of 2006. In mid-2007, he called in to Angie Martinezs show on New York radio station Hot 97 to say he was in limbo and debating whether to release another album . Then, in January of this year, news broke that he had been rushed to a Detroit-area hospital for complications related to pneumonia , and in at least one of those reports, sources were quoted as saying his weight had exceeded 200 lbs.

Those rumors  coupled with a National Enquirer story that quoted an insider as saying that the rapper [has] got a double chin, a potbelly and droopy man-breasts. And hes living a reclusive lifestyle in an attempt to hide his new body  had fans worried about Eminem. But 50, who in recent weeks has battled rumors about his own weight thanks to online photos that show him looking extra gaunt, said that those worries are unfounded. According to him, Ems fine and in fighting shape (or at least, balling shape).

The last time I seen him we played basketball together, 50 said. He had a knee injury, so we chilled for a little bit.



[Intro]
Yo, yo, follow me
Come with me to the dark side of the force
No man would boldly go to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and, oh, so cold, it's, oh, so cold
Oh, so cold, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

[Chorus]
(Stay wide awake)
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where on-ly some will go
(Stay wide awake)
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay wide awake)

[Verse 1]
Fe-fi-fo-fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park, it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target, put my car in park, and approach a tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda, and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider, hi there girl, you mighta
Heard of me before, see whore, you're the kind of girl that I'd a
-ssault and rape, then figure why not try to make your pussy wider
Fuck you with an umbrella then open it up while the shit's inside ya
I'm the kind of guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian, yeah, now let's see her have triplets, and I'll di
-sintegrate them babies as soon as they're out her with formalde
-hyde and cyanide, girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louder
No need for no gunpowder, that only takes all the fun out of
Murderin', I'd rather go vinn-vinn, and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, uhh
Shit, wait a minute, I mean skull, my knife seems dull, pull another one out, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

[Chorus]
(Stay wide awake)
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where on-ly some will go
(Stay wide awake)
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay wide awake)

[Verse 2]
So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's makin' me play hide-and-seek like Jason, I'm so hungry
She's naked, see, no privacy, but I can see she wants me
So patient, see, I try to be, but gee, why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep and I creep right through the front, see
So blatantly, but silently 'cause I know that she's sound 'sleep
"Who's wakin' me so violently, and why's he on top of me?"
"He's rapin' me," she tries to scream, "Somebody please get him off me
He's tapin' me, he's bitin' me, he's laughing like it's funny"
She's scrapin' me, she's fightin' me, she's scratchin' like some dumb freak
Escapin' me, no dice, you see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan, gee, what a sight to see, I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy, but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me 'cause I'm dancing to quite a different drum beat

[Pre-Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

[Chorus]
(Stay wide awake)
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where on-ly some will go
(Stay wide awake)
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay wide awake)

[Verse 3]
Better try to stay wide awake or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch, your soul I'mma try to take
Pray for light of day right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how 'bout now, are you in the shower?
Scour you for six hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did you figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must've just heard the sound of my stomach growlin' from down there
Prowler, there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown ya with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how you cower
Jump out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt, biddy-bye-bye, biddy-bye-bye, it's time to die-die
Ought to not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not ya everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water
Nothing like Son of Sam, so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt? There's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Fun to act like lumberjack when I'm hackin' 'em up with that
What was that? Dial 9-1-1, someone's comin' in from the back

[Pre-Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

[Chorus]
(Stay wide awake)
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where on-ly some will go
(Stay wide awake)
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay wide awake)



[Intro]
Take me to the river
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge, watchin' sales go through the roof
We wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
We were so bulletproofwrote, souped and soaked in our youth
Thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
How to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds
I just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth
'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group
Shoot!

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

[Chorus]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

[Verse 2]
It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
And the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets
The more time goes by, the more life happens
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel
And I feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in
Been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Which reminded me, Biz, "Rockstar" was the shit
Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
If you woulda put D12 on it, wish I coulda did
More than try talkin' you into comin' up off of it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
I think of all of the trips to BET
And the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
But that's water under the bridge
But I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

[Chorus]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

[Verse 3]
Bacardi and Hen', never thought the party would end
One minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is startin' to shift
To these kids you no longer exist
Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
To tiny drops, little drips
And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
You start thinkin' of all the artists you dissed
All the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get
For turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift?
A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none
I just wish I had words, but I guess there just are none for this
To my partners, I can't say how sorry I am
This is not how I planned for our story to end
I love all of you men
But I just can't be the guy everybody depends
On for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair
I will always be here, but that spark isn't there
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that era
I've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fightin' for air
I'm barely chartin' myself
Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent
To treat y'all like a stepping stone
Though I ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road
Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up
But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over

[Chorus]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

[Outro]
I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones
I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones



[Verse 1]
Step right up, I'm about to light up the skyline
So bright, I'mma fuck your whole night up
Light up your glow sticks and go stick a stick in your ass
This is the ghost of Christmas past
This is your host, you're supposed to kiss his ass
This is gross but listen close, if you don't
You can go stick your whole frickin' nose against his crack
'til he lets one go and blows your whiskers back
And get a great big old whiff cause if you last without passing out
You'll be on the next episode of Fear Factor, yeah, I'm back to, back to what?
I don't know, smack a little child actor's butt, Mike Jackson, what?
What the fuck you want? I got a blunt and some Jesus juice
Who needs an excuse these days
The way they rally around pedophiles, you lucky I don't pee in your face
I can do anything and apologize for it later as long
As it ain't a racist tape from '88, than I'm straight of that cannot be forgave
If I drank pee for, 18 years straight and ate shit every day
On a porcelain plate that was shaped like a toilet with a fork and steak, knife
For the rest of my life and had to watch my ex-wife get fucked by Vanilla Ice
Twice a day, cause I said N-I-G-G-A, when I was a teenager
Blaow-blaow, Shade uh 45, shorty, let me get your number, baby
Maybe I can hump your leg or something?
But it's time for me to go, so I stopped, jumped in the vehicle
It's like this, because of that boob, right?

[Receptionist]
Mr. Berman?

[Steve Berman]
What?

[Receptionist]
We have Eminem here to see you

[Steve Berman & Eminem]
About fuckin' time! Send him in
Steve! Good to see ya, man. Um, hey, I just w
Well, look who decided to show his face!
I hope you've had fun in the last four years
Look man, I apologize again for
For shooting me?! Do you know I lost the use of my right arm?
Again, it was a mistake, a terrible mist
Are you wearing a bulletproof vest?
And then you go and do what? Hide out?
Stay in Detroit for almost five years
While the music industry melts the fuck down?
Do you know how many people lost their jobs
Because of your fuckin' vacation?
Well, that's actually why I'm here
I was gonna put out some new music
And I wanted to play it for you and get your opinion
Do I really need to hear it?
Let me guess, another album about: "Poor me!
I'm so famous that it's ruined my rich little life
And I'm such a tortured artist, let me make music about it
And my tragic love life!" Am I on to something here?
Come on, man, it's not like that
You know what? Just hand the fuckin' thing over!
I'm done talkin to you!
Think you can just come and go as you please
Big selfish superstar?
Steve, I had a drug problem!
"Oh, poor me! I had a drug problem!"
Who hasn't had a drug problem in this town?
You know what? (*gun cocks*)
Hey! hey!
Just lay the shit down on my desk and get the fuck out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jesus Christ, man
Alright, alright, here, fine
What's this shit? Two CDs?
That's what I've been tryin' to tell you, man, there's two albums
Just get out!
Alright!
Get the fuck out!
Alright, man, see you later
(*bottle smashes*)



[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Intro]
A lot of people ask me, am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah, I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the Devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you, good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
I'm zonin' off of one joint, stoppin' the limo
Hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, body pierce with this
Livin' amuck, never givin' a fuck
Give me the keys, I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in the cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab (Yeah)
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud
I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn, my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still bein' operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin' this time

[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

[Verse 2]
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast, when your blood spilled, it was still blue
I'll hang you 'til you dangle, and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb
'Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm, and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match ("Here, Momma, try 'em on")
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
(Shittin' on rappers) Causing hospital accidents
God help me, before I commit some irresponsible acts again

[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

[Verse 3]
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spent a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit)
Now, how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique, I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me
From the second I was born, my momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this Earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say?
Brain damage? Fuck, I was born durin' an earthquake

[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, yo, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass



[Intro]
Psst, hey, listen
La la la la la la la la la laaaa
I love my job
Makes me feel like Superman!
La la la la la la la la la laaaa
Can you fly? I can, wanna see?

[Hook]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place you can't see, but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

[Verse 1]
My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
When lyrics are constantly took outta context
Failure to communicate with Congress has
Been a problem for the longest, I guess
But maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought, see how long it takes to digest
Feelin' good when I should be ashamed
Shit, I really shoulda fell but I stood, see, I came
Like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark
There's a ray, there's a light
There's a hope, there's a spark
But when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set the differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe, because

[Hook]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place you can't see, but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

[Verse 2]
My music can be slightly amusin'
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusin'
Just tryin' to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid, ain't it? I get sick of tryin' to explain it
See, I could sit and argue with you, but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy-nosed bleach-blond
'Cause I came here to uplift, let your woes be gone
Tell 'em to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin', constantly usin'
The Constitution as a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothin' less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams
I'll be here when y'all are gone, rebuildin'
World revolvin', still evolvin', still Slim
How many kids will copy? Prob'ly millions
But I'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby till then, 'cause

[Hook]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place you can't see, but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

[Verse 3]
My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids
At an alarming rate; common denominate
Add it up and you'll see just why I dominate
I try to stimulate, but kids emulate
And mimic every move you make, "Slim, you great!"
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain?
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
'Cause man, I see it, feel it, live it, but it's inhumane
For me to see you be influenced and pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I've been through pain
If you get to know me I could be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And it's such a pleasure, every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust, but

[Hook]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place you can't see, but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

{Backmasked}
I'm not here to save you
I'm only here for the ride
So let me entertain you
And everything will be fine



[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I wont ease your strain
You'll be taking it slow, feeding my flame
Shuffling the cards of your game
And just in time
In the right place
Suddenly I will play my ace

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Ha ha
Treat women like property, possessive like a noun with an apostrophe S's, I'd probably stalk broccoli, yes it's
Socrates with a block of cheese and a dollar stuck in this soda pop machine
Got emcees dropping to knees, copping a plea bargain they keep sobbing, like, "please stop it"
Aftermath, bitch, still Detoxing
Looking for us? We over here like we're eavesdropping
Apparently still mad over what I said last year
On that Vegas track, I just look stupid and stand there
And try to act like I can't hear
What? Sorry dear, but I think Pam Grier just stuck a tampon in my damn ear
Just then Foxy Brown, walks up and knocks me down
Kicks me and socks me, ow

[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I wont ease your strain

[Verse 2: Karacter]
I'm not scared, I'm just a white kid in a black neighborhood
Side terror
Wipe off this fear, to not thinking clear
I need to get my head straight
I do feel like a Nazi in a Jewish camp
Concentration
A foolish act to puzzle you fools with the coolest raps like Rubik's cube that I stole just to solve then give it back
Stupid face your making bitch
Loose the mask
Oh wait
I'm sorry that's my bad
Looks like shit
Might be obvious and a waste of my time to say you look like the crap from a sewage plant
But as you were saying
Back to your rant
Lex Luther just got circles ran round his puny ass so fast his neck snapped and it dropped his pants
You've just been schooled by Clark Kent
Shopping at the market
In the parking lot next to your apartment and part from it
You tried to look hard as shit but you pooed your pants
And I didn't even get to use superman yet
And he's my strong suit
Fall soon back on, to attack these villains, and kill em just passing em back and forth, feeling em then put an axe in their nads
That's what I call a hacky sack bitch
Cut cut and pass
You think your lucky
It's Chucky the mother fucking assassin
Castrating stuck in the cabinet sucking a bottle of Aspirin
Preparing a statement while he sharpens his blade
Carves it across his face as he coughs
Testing his voice is it raspy
Nope, just naturally nasty
Get ready for the ass whooping he's bout to serve up like a double cheese burger from Arby's

[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I wont ease your strain

[Verse 3: Karacter]
Dearest resident
Don't flip past this channel and skip it
A paramedic is in your living room slitting scissors through your flannel get up
So get up, feel better, and add up what I said on that chalk board of yours boarded up inside your head
You're almost dead
I'm your guardian
Here we are
Reminiscing this shit as we walk down the hall of wits
Shelve these thoughts
Highlight reel of selfish tall feminist broads
Everyone that's screwed you over when they said they'd call
Seminar, phantom here I am sent to ward these demons off

[Eminem]
Off misogyny
Sodomy, how many chocolaty jell-o pops can he possibly lace, walking atrocity
No wonder you scoff at me, its still obvious I invented prick

[Karacter]
Rest in heaven, I'm evidently milking this game like
Her breasts are dripping
Guess I'm busy, but unless you bitches are seven teen and eleven months I don't want to hear the pessimism
Tell the rest I'm on readers digest while I'm on the toilet
Pizza sky rocket
Gossip isn't
Close to the shit
I must be fast, lickity split
There's no exaggeration, I mean it Brittany
A fan of Trina
Get's me like I wanna jam my weener in Christina

[Eminem]
And Serena and Selena
Scarlett Johansson, Tiffani Amber Thiessen
Give me a damn good reason to not wanna slip an Ambien in a Cappuccino
And try to have a threesome with Janet Reno

[Karacter]
Stuff her with cream like a spicy popper of jalapeno
Appetizer, my main meal's Destiny
Now, If I die I'll come back to haunt your back side grizzly
Capitalize the "Ass" in fucking Caspar and Wendy
As Detroit looking like a power outage, just a black out city
Crack house just down the street of McDonalds, where you lost your virginity
Oh dity, I'm out
Explosive, you're left with the call
You might want to

[Eminem]
Head for the fire exits, I'm coming through like a wrecking-ball

[Karacter]
Test us, we're scared of nothing at all

[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
I wont ease your strain
You'll be taking it slow, feeding my flame
Shuffling the cards of your game
And just in time
In the right place
Suddenly I will play my ace



[Verse 1]
You used to say that I'd never be
Nothin' without you, and I'd believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"
Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze
And you'd laugh, and you'd tease
You're just fucking with me, and you must hate me
Why do you date me, if you say I make you sick?
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge

[Chorus]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
Cause I'm stronger than I was

[Verse 2]
A beautiful face is all that you have
Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"
But you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothin', nothin' for me
So, please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead

[Chorus]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
Cause I'm stronger than I was

[Verse 3]
You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide
That you caused, cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde
Nah, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
It's like you put a knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer!
Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left
And left me with nothin' but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda had and we coulda been
But I'm breakin' out of this slump I'm in
Pullin' myself out of the dumps once again
I'm gettin' up once and for allfuck this shit!
I'ma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin' punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
So don't lump me in with them chump-ions
I'm done bein' your punching bag
It was the November 31st today
Woulda been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the 1st of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call
But couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just nowso I put 'em in a verse to lay

[Bridge]
And I thank you, cause you made me
A better person than I was
But I hate you, cause you drained me
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me, you're crazy
And after all is said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be
I may never trust someone

[Chorus]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
Cause I'm stronger than I was

No more jewelry temperature
I don't care how cold, what temperature degree your fucking jewelry
Jewelry doesn't have a temperature)
Yes no, it cannot be frozen below 400 million degrees
Like it just has to, if you're gonna-
It cannot be a temperature
(It's true. What if it's 90 outside and you got jewelry on? You fucking hot. Stop lying. You ain't cold 'cos you got jewelry. That's a lie. Stop lying to the people)

You cannot be on the level with the devil
You cannot -
(Party. You can't party, don't party with a lil Bacardi)

You're gonna be, if you're gonna be lyrical
You better not -
You better stay the fuck away from miracles
(That's it. No miracles)
(You just a regular mortal human you don't perform miracles if you lyrical)
No no no
No more love in the club
No more
If I go in VIP they don't need to see ID, right
(No more come on )
(They know who you are if you're going to VIP they know your face, you paid for it)
If you're gonna get buried it cannot be in the cemetery
If you are in the cemetery you cannot be buried
No more
(Leave it alone)

And you can't, you cannot
If you go to jail you cannot make bail
If you're gonna have swagger
You cannot be like Mick Jagger
(You gotta be like Lou Ferigno or someone like that)
You can be like Mick Jagger but you... it's one or the other
You have to have one or the other
No more rhyming Mick Jagger with swagger, no
No more spectacular with vernacular
(You got to stay away from that one)

Why do you feel that you have to say that a pencil is a utensil
A pencil is a fucking utensil! Right or wrong?
It's already a utensil you don't have to make
(It's a double negative!)
Once you got the pencil you already have the utensil
The utensil is the pencil so you don't need to

You cannot use a vest to protect your chest
(Come up with some other shit
Come up with something else for it to protect. Get creative)
Maybe the vest protects your abdominals

(If someone's gonna murder you they obviously heard of you right? How do you...?)
I think we went we went over that but  I do think that is important to stress
Because if I murder you like I never heard of you
What is the difference?
Do I not feel as bad because I murdered you because I never heard of you?
(It's fucking stupid)
And if I did hear of you I might actually feel bad, it my weigh on my conscious or something?
(Royce: ...What kind of gratitude do you get from murdering a person you don't know anyway?...Yeah you wanna know...)
(You get no points. It makes no sense)

If you're gonna be near death it cannot be on your last breath
You cannot
You can't be on your last breath near death
But if you've got bodies it's not like John Gotti
You cannot have bodies like John Gotti
You cannot rhyme casket with basket, no more
Money, funny, honey, bunny, no more
(Static, attic, no, it's over)
If you like static, you cannot be an addict for it
(Moderation. Static in moderation. No addictions)
Moderation, static in moderation, static in moderation
(You cannot be addicted to static. Forget it. Those days are over)
You can't you can't
You can start static, if you start static just you cannot get addicted to it
If you become an addict for static, it's automatic
(Ooh you can't be automatic either. It has to be manual)
It cannot, yeah, yo
Manual and it cannot be -
The static has to be...
The static cannot be automatic

I think this is- I think this is good
(It's a good start)
Yeah
(I think they'll be a better MC if they follow these rules)
Yes, this will make you
If you really want to be if you really want to be considered one of the greats
(Mmm-hmm)
You can't do any of this shit
And if you're gonna keep it real, you cannot pack the steel
You can pack the steel but you probably shouldn't keep it real
Keep it fake
(Royce: Be a fake ass motherfucker)
Yep be fake with the steel or be real without the steel
You cannot keep it real and pack the steel
You cannot rip shop in hip hop to the tip-top, you just can't
You can't
(Stay ground level stay ground level)
Ground level
If you're gonna make me drip drop cuz I flip flop
I cannot be in flip flops

If you're a new up-and-comer right in hip-hop and you don't understand the history of hip-hop, that these things have been rhymes way too many times by now, we're just giving you, you know what I'm saying, The Don'ts

Listen I'm telling you something, I'm trying to talk to you, I'm telling you something I'm telling you something young 'un. You're coming up in this game? These are the fucking rules, like it or not. You cannot say this shit, and if, (Facts! Big facts!) and if you come up missing it cannot be like Hoffa. No. No more missing like Hoffa. I think they found Hoffa anyways, didn't they? Yeah they found Hoffa. So you can't. No more missing like Hoffa



[Intro: Eminem & Dina Rae]
Mhmmm *inhales*
You high, baby?
Yeah
Yeah?
Talk to me
You want me to tell you something?
Uh-huh
I know what you wanna hear

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

[Chorus: Eminem]
Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked: bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I be in
We'll see how much you be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

[Chorus: Eminem]
Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl

[Verse 3: Eminem]
First thing you say: I'm not fazed
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me
Ooh yeah, girl, run that game
Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
"Rot In Pieces," uh, that's great
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

[Chorus: Eminem]
Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too

Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout
Bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem  why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of What'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck! I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
It's survival of what?

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 3: Eminem]
(Yeah) So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is itit's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem
Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all







[Intro: Eminem]
It is not about lyrics anymore
Its about a hot beat and a catchy hook

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If we gotta dumb down our style and A-B-C it
Then so be it, cause nowadays these kids, geez
Dont give a shit 'bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat and that's it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ's playin' them hits
"Oh, this my jam! This my shit!
We don't know a word to a verse, all we know is the chorus
Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the song's ginormous, the whole formulas switched
Cause we dont know anymore what are hits"
Is it the beat? Is it the rap?
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap?
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When 13-year-olds control the remotes?
And Ashlee's got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em-pha-sis on our syl-la-la-bles

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
If the emphasis on the compact disc
Is in the beat, then Im gon' feature Em and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Ro'
Cause everywhere I go they love the "bling bling" flow
Bang bang, look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing cost your man a lot of dough
Oh, the fuck am I bustin' my brain fo'?
It's just the way the game go, oh, it takes two to tango
You call this a lame flow? You bought the shit
I guess you to blame, too, I just found an angle
No more reality flow
Im tryna time my album droppin' with a reality show
Cock the MAC-11 in front of Hot 97
And call my publicist, tell her we in press heaven
No one gives a shit except some kids
That just got into sex on the Internet
So you want the chat room or the house in Malibu, Em?
Your emphasis is on the wrong syl-la-la-ble

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
They said 30's the new 20
Funny, must mean 40's the new 30, interesting
'Cause ever since then it's been in a sense an extension
For veteran rappers that are better than half
Of the shit coming out right now, it's all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said its his last, then 50 and Em
Then what? Detox drops, what do we got then?
So now our whole camps is running around
Scramblin' over what to do
Gamblin', and every time we put a record out
Just lookin' for that hook (Wait, Dre, look!)

[Hook: Eminem]
Shorty, I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be
Cause, shorty, you love me
And I love you too
And I promise Ill be true to you

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Go shorty, it's your birthday
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
It's the kid that flip-flows who used to flip O's
And run G for days, you should see how I get hoes
I'm international, I get my dick licked 'round the globe
I'm sick right into shows, ridin' on lolos
Puffin' on coco, my bitch in Manolos
Dont fuck with the dodos, that's slang for dumb hoes
I'm playin', I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around, you could get your ass smoked, Loc
It's not a game, me, B, I ain't playin'
Beat behind me playin', so you don't hear anyway
You dont hear what Im sayin'
Me fin-nini-na, fee-fi-dididee-yay
Just give me my check and Ill be on my way
Sunny, bunny, money and funny
You ain't even listenin' and I just took your money, ha

[Verse 5: Stat Quo]
There once was a time everywhere you turned
Shady/Aftermath was all you heard
But they say 50 sang too much, and Em got soft
And they say Dre just fell the fuck off
Well, fuck the fuck-offs, all y'all eat salt
Be mad, we back, fresh up outta the vault
Oh! New syl-la-la-bles, eat ball, you fuck-offs
Your house, your bitch, I'm getting sucked off
East, South, Midwest, even up North
Fallin' victim to wax, spittin', bring out the white chalk
All for the gingerbread, we get it and get lost
Catch me if you can, Im runnin' past while y'all walk

[Verse 6: Cashis]
Shady made me for bringin' it back
'Fore the history of rap is gone with a snap
A snare and a clap, what happened to just spittin'
About livin' in the mothafuckin' city you at?
In the grimiest condition, I breathe in drama
King Mathers and Cash, me, that's free karma
I'm everything, anything you can never be
It's a hidden rhyme of the month deep in the beef
I speak with a piece, no peace on my mind
I repeat every evil deed done of mine
No rest contest, contract to sign
By blood, I'm in this squad for life
Hear about out my windpipes and I just chime
I'm the reason you guys won't say that line
Im crazy, renegade like Em and Jay-Z
Im Rosemarys baby, I want you to hate me

[Hook: Eminem]
Shorty, I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be
Cause, shorty, you love me
And I love you too
And I promise Ill be true to you

[Outro: Eminem]
It is not about lyrics anymore
It is not about lyrics anymore
It's about a hot beat, a hot beat
It's about a hot beat, a hot beat
A hot-hot-hot beat and a catchy hook
A hot-hot-hot beat and a catchy hook
Nobody gives a damn about them syllables
Syl-la-la-bles, whatever they are
I don't care if you gotta rhyme schmo, mo, Joe, toe and glow
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some goddamn records!
Now, get out there and sell some



Its not about lyrics anymore, its about a hot beat and a catchy hook

[Eminem]
If we gotta dumb down our style and ABC it
Then so be it
Cause nowadays these kids, jeez
Dont give a shit bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat and thats it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJs playing them hits
Oh this my jam, this my shit
We dont know a word to a verse
All we know is the chorus
Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the songs ginormous, the whole formulas switched
Cause we dont know anymore, what are hits
Is it the beat, is it the rap
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When 13 year olds control the remote
And Ashleys got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em-phasis on our syllables

[Jay-Z]
If the emphasis on the compact disc isnt the beat
Than Im gon feature EM and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Rove
Cause everywhere I go they love the bling bling flow
Bang bang look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing cost ya man lot of dough, oh
The fuck am I busting my brain for?
Its just the way the game go, oh, it takes two to tango
You call this a lame flow
You bought the shit
I guess you to blame too
I just found the angle
No more reality flow
Im tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
Cock the Mac 11 in front of Hot 97
And call my publicist tell her we in press heaven
No one gives a shit except some kids who just got into sex on the internet
So you want the chat room or the house of Malibu Em?
Your emphasis is on the wrong Syllable

[Dr Dre]
They said 30s the new 20
Funny, must mean 40s the new 30
Interesting cause ever since then its been in a sense
An extension for veteran rappers that are better than half
Of the shit coming out right now
Its all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said its his last and 50 and Em
Then what? Detox drops what we got then
So now our whole camps is running around scrambling over what to do
Gambling everytime we put a record out
Just looking for that hook

[Eminem]
(Wait Dre look)
Shorty I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be cause shorty
You love me
And I love you too
And I promise Ill be true to you

[50 Cent]
Go shorty, its your birthday
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
Its the kid that flip flows who used to flip Os
And run G for days used to see how I get hoes
Im international, I get my dick licked round the globe
Im sick right into show, riding on lolos
Puffing on coco, my bitch in Manolos
Dont fuck with the dodos, I sling for dumb hoes
I playing, I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around, you could get your ass smoked
Look, its not a game, me B, I ain't playing
Beep behind me player, so you here anyway
You dont hear what Im saying
Me fin-nini-na
Fee-fi-dididee-yay
Just give me my check and Ill be on my way
Sunny bunny money and funny
You ain't even listening and I just took your money

[GR Lynch]
This ain't top 40 or hit list shit
Not for TRL, no Rick Dees' picks
This is straight GRL ski mix bitch
Call me Strasburg when I pitch this shit
I leave these other rappers so tongue-tied
They just local, GR's worldwide
You sound like cabbage, ya wilted outside
I spit tomatoes straight from the vine
Leave these other artists lookin all sundried
A bunch of little stains, to them I'm Tide
Keep a stain stick in my Subaru ride
Glass all black can't see us igniting
Paint white out like you fucked up writing
Mount baker bout to get a boost in style
In the parking lot they can't help but smile
Ma'am please cover the eyes of your child
Gunz come out you know bumpin 50
Subie 2 shes covered with bitties
Snowpants blue like the sign for thrifty
So baggy what are those a fuckin size 60?
Burrito legs bitch, call me big shitty



Don't ask me what's up with the hoes, I'm still working the kinks out
Love stinks, that explains all this anger that's spillin' out
And I ain't chilling out. Got an Oscar but I'm still a grouch
I use it as a doorstop and a prop for the broken leg for the couch
Yelawolf, Shady, Tony-Touch, Slaughterhouse
Yeah the SWAT team 'bout to break them flyswatters out
Go to hell in a drought, break ice waters out
Nice try shorty wop, we can windowshop the jewelry store
But Christ for that price coulda bought a house
Besides only thing I ever had iced out was my heart since I started out
Its F.Y.I, if ya ain't knowing
What, go with you? Where? Nah, ain't going
Oh wait, you wanna date? Oh, well in that case ho, it's June 8th, oh!
And kinda like Beethoven composin' a symphony of hate
So much hate woven into these raps
He stitches a bitch, straight sewin'
Shit, I'm beginning to hate clothing
I hate overalls cause they remind me of hoes
For Christ sake, they're shaped like an H woah and
You know what else starts with H though?
Hockey, shit, thought I had the place flowing
I hate to put you on ice but
You already had 3 periods in 60 minutes, great going
Plus you remind me of cocaine, ho
You always in the mirror with your face
So, I feel an urge to put you all in a line
And chop you with a razor blade, yo wait, I'm an a-hole
Devil with a halo
Hell yeah, I'd nail J-Lo to the railroad
Say I won't! Better hope you can stay afloat
When I take the wind out your sailboat
But, I ain't playing yo! Dope as Shady?
Don't kid yourself, bitch you ain't even a baby goat



(dialing tone)

[Eminem]
Uh, this is Marshall, I call there all the time
Um, who is this? (It's Frantz) Pardon?
(Frantz, Frantz) Frantz, ok, Frantz
What I wanna do, actually
I wanna get a-eh, eh, it's called-I call it
The Slim Shady platter, it's like, with shrimp, like, around it
And inside, it's like, um
It's like a piece of liver that they give me
And they-they put like, salad on the side
(You want a dry sheem or the sheem with sauce)
Wha-wil-- Blergh-hrm-be-lay-la?
(You want a dry sheem or the sheem with sauce) Shu, shu
Schwepp-a-hrm-de-lay-la!
[mocking accent]
Uh, hmph, I needed shrimp, I needed shrimp

Okay? I fuck mama, hello?

[Intro: Pacewon]
Some Outsidaz shit
I started hearing laughter in my head
Somebody laughing at me
Always laughing at me
Im bout to go crazy
So I started to set it on niggas, nah mean?
Pacewon!

[Bridge: Pacewon]
Im high like Redman, tripping with a tab of acid
In my headband (Bout to lose my mind)
The names Pacewon, Ill kick that ass quickly
When I die Ima try to take the whole world with me (Me!)
Raw rhymes, penetrate the kidney
When I die Ima try to take the whole world with me
(I got plans to lock it down) Take it with me
Take it with me, the whole world with me

[Verse 1: Pacewon]
Yeah, I be hitting you with rude shit
I be rolling like crews with new whips, call it stupid
But I mastered the fantastic ghetto bastard
Raw rap style to kick that ass with
Rough as Brillo, nympho spreading like info
More than the Jacksons got kinfolk
Your crew not strong, they stink like your mother feet
When she walk in shoes with no socks on
Light as popcorn, me! Disciplining fresh MCs
That youd be scared to rock for

[Chorus: Pacewon]
(Who dat?) Im low down and Im shifty
When I die Ima try to take the whole worth with me
(Me!) Most MCs get slapped cause they sissy
When I die Ima try to take the whole worth with me
Take the world, take it with me
Take it with me, set it!

[Interlude: Eminem]
Yeah! Eminem!
Dirty Dozen! Yeah!

[Verse 2: Eminem (Pacewon)]
Im in the sound-proof booth without a roof
Drunk off 180-proof vodka with Dr. Ruth (What!)
We in the vocal room inhaling Magic Markers
Sitting in the dark lighting our blunts with sparklers
We got my man Pacewon behind the boards
Cause we tied the engineer up with output cords (Outsidaz, what!)
Bizarres in the lobby with the Beatles, smoking bowls
Poking holes in his veins with dirty needles
We get all doped up from popping uppers
And run a train on Foxy Brown without rubbers (Uh, uh-huh, yeah)
Smoking homegrown drugs, thats why you can barely tell
What the fuck were saying, like Bone-Thugs (Uh!)
Hitting blunts til my lungs contort, smoke
Then take one more short toke before I snort coke (What!)
Shit, I been doing lines all day (What!)
My minds all clay from smelling Pine-Sol spray (What!)
What! No, hold up, hold up, hold up (Hold up!)
Smoking laced weed wrapped up in a fruit Roll-Up
My lungs are all swole-up and bout to bust open
Im just hoping I dont die from snorting crushed Motrin

[Chorus 2: Eminem (Pacewon)]
I need drugs, somebody fix me
When I die, Ima try to take the whole world with me (Me!)
Twelve blunts, plus Im bringing your girl with me
When I die, Ima try to take the whole world with me
Im not coming back, so dont send no one to get me
When I die, Ima try to take the whole world with me (Gimme dat)
Fuck that, give me all my shit free
When I die, Ima try to take the whole world with me

[Verse 3: Bizarre (Pacewon)]
Wack MCs, theres a new sheriff in town
Put your guns down or die with a ill frown
The Outsidaz doing uppers and downers (Uh-huh, yeah)
Clowners, even masters scared to hang around us (Ugh!)
Im a slob that dont have a job (What!)
Peek through your windows, steal the good from your mom (Ma!)
We the starters, yall niggas hit the benches
Smacking more hoes than Joe Jackson at feminine convention
Cop some mushrooms, I just cant see
Pull me out the bathroom, Im bout to OD (D!)
Nasty, dirty, some say Im filthy
Every time I drop the rap, Outs be like (Ill, B!)
Brains too high, have no fear
Eat the pussy of a girl with burning gonorrhea
I made a box with a thugger on DD
Our crews more stupid on wax than Cowdy from Lion King
Whos the big guy high off chocolate kai
If you disrespect me, youll lyrically die (Die!)

[Chorus 3: Bizarre (Pacewon)]
Somebody hide me, somebody get me
When I die, I take the whole world with me (Me!)
Im bout to do your girl named Cindy
When I die, I take the whole world with me (Lockin' it down!)
You bomb my set, I give her Good-N-Plenty
When I die, I take the whole world with me
You know my flow is so ill
MCs on the microphone and get verbally killed (Killed!)

[Outro: Pacewon]
All yall niggasll get killed
Fucking with the Dirty D
Pacewon up in this motherfucker
All motherfuckers better act like they know
You MC, I dont give a fuck where you from
Close to me or far from me
Ima see your wack ass
Pacewon! Pacewon!



[Intro]
Yo, Dre Man
Make my vocals sound sexy... woo!
Come on, man, come on, man, okay

[Chorus]
It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm that guy man, shove a diamond up my hind end
And crush it with my butt muscles while I cut vocals
Slut poke holes in ya shirt, jump in mud puddles
While I stomp mudholes in ya ass girl, now let's cuddle
Blood curdlin', you're gurglin' on your blood, what'll
I do for my next trick? I'm feelin' wonderful
I think I might just do somethin' a little less subtle
Shove a fuckin' Tonka truck up a little kid's butthole
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador
Of the Valentine's Day Massacre slash assassin
I slash her in the ass with a icicle
And leave her layin' a blood bath while I
Put a catheter in and jump in the bath with her
In my Spider-Man mask, man
Just imagine the fun I can have with a strap-on
Stick it up Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon
Are those pistachios? Damn, I'd like to have some
Laying on the patio, man, rolling a fat one
Shady, drop the magic marker, put the cap on
Goddamn, man, are you that much of an asshole?

[Chorus]
It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm like Houdini, tuck my teenie eenie weenie between each
One of my thighs and make it disappear like a genie
Make the shit disappear like Tara Reid in a bikini
Believe me, homie, you don't know the meaning of a meanie
They call me the fruit loop from Jupiter
I'm tryna maneuver the Hoover up in your poop shoot
Don't move or ya might get it stuck so fuckin' far up in your uvula
You ain't gonna know what he was tryna do to ya gluteus
Totally tubular, sniffin' glue through a tube in the studio
Now who do ya think is more fruitier?
Wiener smothered in peanut butter, puttin' on a tube of ya
Eye shadow and man, it looked nice, you should've seen it, mother
I think I'll put a piece of art on my Visa card
Then I'll go beat Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart
Then mosey on over to Rosie O'Donnell's with McDonald's
Jump on her lap and watch The Sopranos

[Chorus]
It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Shady, what are you doin' chewin' on a human?
Grab an aluminum bat, hit Heidi Klum in the back, boom!
And assumin' the fact that that dude's in the back room
Usin' the bathroom, vacuumin' a raccoon
Skewin' a rat, a cat screwin' a baboon
You shouldn't ask what is he doin' with that broom
You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds
You in a trance, I'm back doing my dance, ooh
But they're afraid I might get Sarah Palin by the hair
And make her wear a bathin' suit and take her parasailin'
Shady, why do you gotta pick on the lady for?
Why you make her read 84 bedtime stories to you in baby talk?
'Cause I'm scared there's monsters under my bed
Kellie Pickler hid my juice box under my bassinet
No wonder my ass is wet, my diaper needs to be changed
You like graffiti, dyke? Well, I can pee-pee and write your name

[Chorus]
It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

[Outro]
Fine, nobody wants to play with me?
Fuck you then, bitch!
You guys are always mean to me anyways
All you ever do is rub gum in my hair and stuff
You guys are gonna make me... make me sad, I'm sad
I'm gonna cry... I'm crying
I'm going to tell my mom... Mom!



[Intro: Eminem]
Ayo, before I start this song, man
I just wanna thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew
I was goin' through growin' pains
Hatred was flowin' through my veins
On the verge of goin' insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin' and I wasn't
Anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too
God, it feels like I'm goin' psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even? You're lyin' to yourself, you're slowly dyin'
You're denyin' your health is declinin' with your self-esteem
You're cryin' out for help

[Chorus: Kobe and Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 2: Eminem & Kobe]
Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though (Oh-oh, oh)
But I must be talkin' to the wall though, I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate
His thoughts are bottled inside him
One foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself
Do something 'bout it, admit you got a problem
Your brain is clouded, you pouted long enough
It isn't them, it's you, you fuckin' baby!
Quit worryin' 'bout what they do, and do Shady
I'm fuckin' goin' crazy

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So I picked myself up off the ground
And fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore, I was on drugs; Relapse, I was flushin' 'em out
I've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around
I got somethin' to prove to fans, 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me
And homie, I don't show no signs of slowin' up
Oh, and I'm blowin' up all over
My life is no longer a movie, but the show ain't over, homos
I'm back with a vengeance, homie
Weezy, keep ya head up, T.I., keep ya head up
Kanye, keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slayin' them, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day, and um

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Outro: Eminem]
So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was just some shit I was going through
And to everybody else, I'm back! (I'm back!)
Ha-ha (Ha-ha)



[Hook: Eminem]
Now, I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You're starin' straight into a barrel of hate, terrible fate
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed  wait, Sarah, you're late
Your train left, mascara and eggs smeared on your face
Night's over, goodbye, ho, I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut ain't nothin' to cry over
Never shoulda came within range of my Rover
Shoulda known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib must want me to mess with her mind
Hold up, she mistook me for some high roller
Well, I won't buy her soda unless it's Rock & Rye Cola
(Faygo's cheaper) Buy you a bag of Fritos?
I wouldn't let you eat the fuckin' chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya
Tryin' to pull five bucks from me is like tryin' to pull five molars
You'll get your eyes swoll up
I'm on my straight grizzly, so why would I buy you a gay-ass teddy bear? Bitch, you're already bi-polar

[Hook: Eminem]
Now, I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

[Verse 2: Eminem]
TIP told me on this ho tip, best tip I could give you to hip you
Is never to let these tricks trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love you slut, shit
Dig you, ho? Take a shovel and dig you some dignity, bitch!
Shit, you talk about some advice that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone, tell me to stick to my guns
Like double stick, it's you, but fuck em, TIP, it's cool
I'm chillin' like a villain
Like the penguin in its fuckin' igloo eating fudgesicles
Id rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
Before I tie the fuckin' knot Id tie you in one, bitch
You think this is some Nintendo game, how fuckin' dumb is you?
Ill give you some lumps before I split some lump sums with you
So heres a penny for your thoughts
But it wont buy you a cheeseburger
But a nickel might just get you one pickle
Fuck it, it's official, so blow the whistle, I got a trust issue
There's a bombshell: Scud missile
Like I just cuss at you to fuckin' cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was a motherfuckin' stud, slut, this'll
Teach you not to come drunk stumbling my way, for shizzle
I still live like I budget a Gilbert's Lodge check stub, bizzle
So fuck Sizzler! These checkers are bust like a blood blister

[Hook: Eminem]
Now, I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yeah, I guess life is a bitch  aint it, TIP?
And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back? I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
Im givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
Im sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't, Ill stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin' it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker; that clock, I'm racin' it
Double timin' it, but I still spit triple the amount of insults
In a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks
To catch on; while you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man, I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe "S" on it, dog
And they say McDonalds isnt a restaurant, well, I guess Im wrong
But if you gonna tell me that A&W ain't the spot
For the best hot dogs, you can get the F on, dawg

[Hook: Eminem]
Now, I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

[Outro: T.I.]
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said it's over and that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Yeah, goodnight, its over
And that's all she wrote



[Intro]
I'm a little nutty and I know it but if you go back and take a look at my history
You will see that I am not the only one who's off his rocker, there were many before me
I was always labeled the black sheep of the family, what a bad seed I'd grow to be
But if you take a look at us now you'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree

[Interlude]
Alright look, I'mma tell you the story from my side
Maybe you'll understand, check it out

[Verse 1]
You done witnessed unexplainable shit
Too insane to explain, people run from what they just don't get
Maybe Shady should have just hit 'em with a little bit
Did I spit too soon? Should I have spoon fed 'em it?
But I was just so eager to prove I was even
Worth bein' in the same league or the room
Of the people of whom I was in
Every now and then, I look up like I was seekin' approval
Was it because of the pigment of my skin?
Or was it a figment of my imagination?
Maybe it bothered me more than it did them
Maybe it wasn't a big deal back then
But to me it was, see what it was
Was I had developed a complex from being judged
Proof spit his verse, now I'm next, let's see who balks
I'm in the booth staring back to see whose mugs
I get a reaction from, usually the first thumb
Was from Proof and the rest of the crew backed him up
And no one lied to each other 'cause none of us had deals
It was real, we just wanted tickets for that meal

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

[Verse 2]
Ever since my mother was pregnant with a second egg
'Cause she said that I had a baby sister
Who fell outta the window, I was too young to remember
Kansas City projects, I was like 5-6
And how come, I remember Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogy
If it was the projects in Missouri?
'Cause those were my best friends until Isaac
Took my tricycle and my Uncle Todd went to try to go get it back
And ended up gettin' jumped and cut in the gut
With a switch and 70 some stitches
Which is, to this day, why my mother still tries to show me
Some old fake pictures
Of a fictitious little sister who never existed
And this is why part of my life's so twisted
But I can never be as sick as that bitch is
And by the way, that pictures one of my relatives

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

[Verse 3]
You probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain
To see why everything I say is so insane
What's different about my brain
That separates me from other players in this game?
On the surface it may seem like a scheme
Or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy
But that's the last thing I need
Is for people to walk around feelin' sorry for me
And I am not a G, never claimed to be
I gave my vest to Cashis, just hope he don't need it more than me
But we'll see, 'cause we ain't lookin' for beef
But if it comes our way, what do we turn the other cheek? Come on

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

[Outro]
Yeah, and I'm the crazy one right?
Whatever, then let me be the crazy one!
Cuckoo, cuckoo, tweet



[Intro: Green Lantern, Eminem & 50 Cent]
Okay (Yeah)
It's about that time again (Haha)
Green Lantern (That's Right)
G-G-G-G-G Uni-*burp*
Shit!
Hahaha, Shady
We back (Invasion!) Part II
The Conspiracy

[Hook: Eminem & Green Lantern]
'Cause we ain't gonna never stop, you just keep wasting your energy
On us, you should find something to do with your time (time)
And quit fuckin' with us 'cause we ain't fuckin' with you
And E must be fuckin' with you so much you must be gone out your mind
(Shady Records mixtape, let's go Em)

[Verse: Eminem]
They say I'm a day away from my entire empire crumbling
Speak up, you're mumbling, what the fuck-a you's a
Bibi-bay okay big-bi-bi-baby, this is Shady
I know you was bi-bi-hoping we be-be-would just go away
But weeble mable weeble wobble but we don't fall down like
Jam Master Jay's two turntables, our label is just too stable
Your magazine's so motherfucking thin you using staples
To hold it together it's turning back into a newspaper
And ya'll got somethin' for my ass every issue
Thank you, 'cause I keep runnin' out of fucking tissues
And I could diss you but God I was sick of looking at you
At least now I can see when Nike's got a new tennis shoe
But-but I guess no good news is always good-good news
Moving on to bigger and better things (chicka chicka jeera)
50's blowing up, this year just keeps going up
What the fuck is going on? Who the fuck is Norah Jones?
Shady, wait a minute, baby, leave the whore alone
Just go up there and be humble and take them awards home
Bush has just declared the world a fucking war zone
Meanwhile we got a war going on of our own at home
My fuckin' mind's blown
Trying to figure out how to fight my own clone
Rhinestones are so nice, they shine so bright
Especially at night
After a hit of ecstasy, ain't that right Ro'oh?
Wait a minute, I'm rambling
Back to the matter at hand, it's Green Lantern
With Elvis Presley the selfish MC
Back to the ruin rap and destroy the industry
Single handedly and oh man did we
Yeah me and 50, Obie, me and Twizzy
And Nelly and Missy and Jigga
God damn, it's all a plan devised by the Man
It's a conspiracy against fake shit, and anybody who can't make hits
Or ain't dope lyrically, so fuck what you heard and what you read about
We ain't ruining rap baby we're just trying to weed it out
Shady in the place to be see
And I got what it takes to rock the mic, aiight!
Still keep talking shit to me punk
'Cause your magazine's over in less than six months!

[Outro: Eminem]
Haha, Shady Records, still Aftermath!
And don't think we can hear you motherfuckers talking
'Cause we can't
We don't hear y'all
So we just gonna sit back for the rest of our lives
While you ride our dicks

  2002 Aftermath Records



Eminem riddled everyone by posting the squared picture of "The Equalizer" on Instagram - the movie with his favorite actor, Denzel Washington.

Just a day later, trailer has arrived.

It features Sia's singing and Eminem, most likely, singing a bridge to song. This snippet would be from their second collabo, with "Beautiful Pain" being first.

Eminem is most likely to do a full soundtrack, maybe even a music video for this song and/or make a cameo.

Stay tuned for more info on the song. As for the movie, it's coming 26th September.



Saw an old black cop
Drinking coffee from a small black cup
Eating some saucy cold snack yup
He was about to call back up
He said that the evil man is about to crawl back up
Then he said it's a mis-controlled wack mix up
How the fuck can you make 5 tracks
Ending up all wack?
Your music I invested in that
Give me my quarter back
Tom Brady of humble rap
What is that
Just another term to rhyme with mumble rap
I spit on a track y'ou stumble crumble like a maniac
Waiting for Marcus to come back
With a huge attack to make rap payback
Rages like a lumber jack picks his axe and smacks your ass till he cracks it in half
Now you can have your quarter back
But still I am ill / I a mill
Have to pay the bill
Always on my chill pill
But I still managed to kill Jill
Sorry but I had to deal with your attitude
You always conclude that I'm the one rude
If I get another chance I'll burry it in crude
I don't have a dollar so I ain't scared of being sued
With all that mentality but still I'm broken ill2
So I can't focus on my aim dude
Feels like I got nothing to do
Now that I view what I've come to
I can see that I've fallen at the end
That track won't give me enough money to spend
For the weekend just to pretend that I am a celeb
With a friend
If you don't like this song I'll just extend it
I just need enough money to have my music blended



[Verse 1: Eminem]
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstanding
Any man planning to battle will get snatched out of his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standing
I'm headed for hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
"Bill Clinton, hit this and you better inhale"
Cause any emcee that chooses to go against me
Is getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky
Came home in a frenzy, pushing a ten-speed
Screaming at Aunt Peg
With three spokes sticking out of my pant leg
Eff a headache, give me a migraine, damn it, I like pain
And you should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowing you wack
You act up and I'm throwing you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwing you back up 'em
If they don't like the track, fuck 'em
The rap struck 'em harder than getting hit by a Mack truck
And then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper that trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'm a climb the Empire State Building
Get to the last step and still have half left

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Pompous, roll with monsters and dons for accomplices
Cock non-fiction concepts constant
Bomb threat and I ain't even on yet
On spec, I spit thunder and you ain't even seen the storm yet
Lightning in the clouds, start a fight in the crowd
Hyper and loud, get this mic in your bowels, biting my style
Attack all of y'all, react on the thought of y'all
Slaughter y'all, I'm calling y'all, in fact, I'm blackballing y'all
More official than an ordered pistol aimed toward rappers
Blame fame for it, shrapnel bits tore the tissue
Burying the [?] under the gravel
Saw off the pump handle and barrel for carrying convenience
My odyssey carries the [?], compare me to Phoenix
Solid and hard and light up a star, I got to be Venus
Huddle and bomb back, take cover and all that
And try to not die, you not rugged enough
You just shook as soon as I step foot in this rap game
I'm a bubble on contact like peroxide, I'm touching a cut
You stuck in my raps, [?]
Y'all sucking my ass, boosting my confidence a buck and a half
I know the game, I'm a train trapped inside a name
And whoever they taught me, yo, we ride the same
I shoot crews with the truth and chew lies of change
Speeding on a dragon in an attempt to collide with fame

[Verse 3: Eminem]
This 9 is lifting you six feet when I spray rounds
Hit you with six shots in mid-air and four more on the way down
As eight strays graze through a kid's hair on the playground
You lay down on a stretcher (Don't get carried away now)
No pun intended, just hop out of this whip
And leave it unattended 'fore I whip out this gun and end it
Unless you want it dented with bullet holes in one minute
Cause I can leave your Infinit' full of those even if someone's in it
Snatch the airbag, hit the corner and park it
Corner the market, I got her tied up in a chair and gagged
Bitches get slapped and grabbed by the hair and dragged
Like cavewomen while I'm gravedigging with Marilyn Mans'

[Verse 4: Royce da 5'9"]
You get laced by the gun in case you try to run
Hatred on my face by the ton, get baked by the sun
Constructed of interplanetary rock and metal
Topping levels of combustion that's hot enough to stop the devil
Innovative thrust that a enemy
The impact'll be the generated destructive energy to flatten trees
Black boy since birth, burst and tore the womb up
To hit the earth like a asteroid and blow the moon up
Trust me, I'm the epitome, you better bust me
Anybody can say, "Eff [me]", and he gon' touch me
Smoking organic ganja inside of a stanza
Me and my man cypher with cans of volcanic lava
Man, and it's hot, I'm out of my head
From the bottom
I can leap out a bottomless pit and land at the top
Raw, that's what I came out here for
To raise an eclipse and occasional trips to the beer store
Switch up the breed of emcee and stick a chick up
Vigorous speed to reach in the sea and pick a fish up
I'm fly against all laws of gravitation
I done crushed all ya'll, now you want a collaboration
But eff that, you stepped up, so I'm a eff your rep up
And tear the rest up with every joint that I press up
So stop violence or violence'll stop you
Got crews iller than anybody on your block do
I roll with a white boy that pop 'shrooms
Listen to rock tunes and jump in a costume and rob you

[Verse 5: Eminem]
What a wonderful day, I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
"Hi, Rene, I was just about to toss a live grenade
In your driveway and drive away
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS?"
Blood dripping from it
Ripping your stomach up from the waist up
You talk a lot of ish, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows just for a joke and a laugh
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Waging wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
And wiped my ass with his page in Source
Demon is here, I'm steaming this year
I rip Mystikal's voice box out and scream in his ear
It's not a gimmick, trick, it's an image, I live it
Give a what? I don't know what a "what" is to give it

[Verse 6: Royce da 5'9"]
I grab your throat and squeeze it until it's swollen
Then exceed it until it explodes over your shoulders
Pick up your urn with ashes in it and piss in it
Diss intended to verge like a hearse with a witch in it
No more do I battle emcees for fun
Now it's guns and niggas should run from the [?]
It's barely vivid you witness rare exhibits of terrorism
Through Israel and the art when even they're dark and dismal
I'm a deranged breed, shoot me
I'll catch a bullet in my teeth
And spit it right back at you at the same speed
I'll injure if I'm offending you, we can go to blows
Even my interview should be a Hip-Hop Quotable
You can have the title, that's for brothers that's cocky
I'll take the belt with diamonds in it like Ted DiBiase
I'm rebelling your chains, in fact, you wack
I'm telling you the plane still spelling your name in your raps
You're soft-hearted, I'll say, "Let's take it to the streets"
You'll start pleading with me before we can get the walk started
I'm a deranged breed, so don't try to touch this
5'9", I told you I don't know the chorus

[Verse 7: Eminem]
Forget a chorus, my metaphors are so complicated
It takes six minutes to get applause
And by the time you all catch on, I'm a end your career
And walk away with the floor, so you have nothing to fall back on
I'll throw you out of ten floors
Pull a freaking headache out of my head and put it in yours
I'm indoors, waiting for this acid to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores
This trick wanted to blow me, I said, "It ought to happen"
"You swallow nut, girl?" "No, but I brought a napkin"
Getting skully while I'm autographing
Got my daughter laughing
Cause I sent her mother white water rafting
I'm not a fact, I'm a proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocking my U-Haul
Screaming, "You ain't moving here"
"Lorena Bobbitt, come here, want a souvenir?
I've been high as "L" since I was a juven-eer
Juvenile? Same difference, I need some 'caine
Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up to seven slain infants
Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'



It's hell to be Shady
Yesterday I yelled a degrading insult
At an elderly lady
Then I asked her how it felt to be eighty
Fuck a senior citizen
Suck a wiener, sit and spin
And why you driving so slow for
Don't you wanna get where you going faster
Since you probably gonna die tomorrow
You old whore, die old bitch, die
Before I murder you



[Intro]
And everyone should get along
Okay, children, quiet down, quiet down
Children, I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day: his name is Mr. Shady
Children, quiet down please
Brian, don't throw that! (Shut up!)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute
While Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (He got AIDS!)
Good luck, Mr. Shady!

[Verse 1]
Hi there, little boys and girls! (Fuck you!)
Today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say hi, Bob ("Hi, Bob!")
Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark
And fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (Ahh!)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said, "Knock it off!"
But Bob wouldn't knock it off, 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as he chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want anyit's bad for you

[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (Come on)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Ask him, man)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (That's right)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (That's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Uh-huh)
Then there's really nothin' else to say (Sing along)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Verse 2]
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck no, you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy, it's the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys
And the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull (blblblblblb)
His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin' (Bleh)
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting their money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders
Hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels, class, 'cause it's bad for you

[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (That's right)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (That's right)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids say no to drugs (Smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (That's right)
And there's really nothin' else to say (But umm)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Verse 3]
And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure
They pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Like fat women in G-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady, what's a G-string?) It's yarn, Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus
Your tongue gets all swoll up like a cow's tongue
(How come?) 'Cause it comes from a cow's dump (Gross!)
See, drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)
But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and OD
They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you

[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (Uh-huh)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Put that down!)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can ask)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (And she will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Like I do)
And there's really nothin' else to say (That's right)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Outro]
Come on, children, clap along! (Shut up!)
Sing along, children! (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!)
Come on, clap along
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs! (Kiss my motherfuckin' ass!)
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! Goddamn it!)
(Mushrooms killed Kenny!)
(Uh, the fart button's on) (*fart*) (Ew, ahh!)
La la la (So fucked up right now)



[Verse 1]
Hey there, little boys and girls
Hey there, little boys and girls (Mmkay?)
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob
(Huh?) Say hi Bob! ("Hi, Bob!")
Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job
'Cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark
And fake like he walks his dog, drag 'em in the woods
And go straight to the chopping blocks
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face
And said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said: "Knock it off!"
But Bob wouldn't knock it off
'Cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her
(AAH!) And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want anyit's bad for you

[Hook]
The kids, the kids!
Don't forget about the kids, the kids!
Shady, what about the kids, the kids?
(?) The kids, the kids!
Shady, what about the kids, the kids?
You gotta save the kids!

[Verse 2]
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck no, you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Hehehehe!)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy, it's the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends
At a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys (C'mon!)
And the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull {*blblblblblb*}
His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin horizontal, barfin' {*BLEH*}
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"H- hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting the money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders
Hunched up like he's practicin' yoga (*gasp*)
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels, class
'Cause it's bad for you

[Hook: Teacher]
The kids, the kids!
Shady, what about the kids-
Don't forget about the kids, the kids!

[Verse 3]
And last but not least, one of the most humungous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure
They pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
And you put it- put it- put it- put it- put it-

[Intro: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, cause I'm

[Chorus: Rihanna (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the

[Chorus: Rihanna (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spinRumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Bridge: Rihanna (Eminem)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
(Get along with) Get along with the voices inside of my head
(You're tryin' to) You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
(And you think) And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'

[Outro: Rihanna (Bebe Rexha)]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)



You have reached the voicemail box of: Suck it

Hey, Em. What's going on? It's Paul. Uh, I wanted to call you to let you know we're getting ready to shoot the "Monster" video. We got dates for Rihanna and she's gonna come out to Detroit and we can get it shot. We've got some concepts together based on your conversations with Rich Lee and I think we're ready to go.

So the basic concept is sort of like an Inception-type of vibe. The whole video sort of happens inside of your head and Rihanna, in the beginning, is gonna act as your therapist. And you answer into her office, you sit down and you sort of fall asleep or drift off; we're not really sure. And next thing you know, you're travelling in this elevator and the elevator sort of represents your journey and your career. And there's various stops along the way. We're gonna recreate some scenes from some of your classic moments.

I had to go home and get my straightjacket. Redoing this scene actually brings back no memories for me because I don't remember it. Dr Dre would say, "I'm glad to see you got your coat back on. The way things should be."

The scene from the "My Name Is" video, with you in the straightjacket and Dre as your therapist in the psychiatrist's office there.The song which recieved an Oscar for you ,yes "Lose yourself" will also be included. We're gonna go back and revisit "The Way I Am", with you jumping off the building, falling through the sky, with everything moving past you. And then we're also gonna do the classic Grammy scene, with you and Elton John performing "Stan".

"I can't see it all. Even if I could, it'll all be grey. But your picture on my wall, it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad".

So, all these things are going on in your head. You're travelling through the elevator, looking at it from a new perspective, with you watching yourself. And then when you finally get to the end of your journey in the elevator, you come out and you see this sort of caged beast. And the beast is actually Slim Shady.

Slim Shady's inside of this cage and you walk up and you don't really know what's going on. And then you see it's actually yourself. And Slim Shady's feeding you some notes and we can just assume that the notes might be some lyrics or some song titles scribbled on them. And the idea that you keep feeding Slim Shady with fame and all of the things that go along with it. And the songs'll keep coming back out.

So, it's really kind of a trip. It's very surreal. Less performance than some of your recent videos but this is more cinematic and it's more of a story through this journey.

So, anyway. Call me back after you listen to this. Um, I sent the treatment over, read through it and get ready for some really long days. Later.

I'm done. It's a wrap. Uh, I never want to perform in these clothes again. Way too small. I'm try'na go, like, quadruple X next time. So, these clothes are a fucking wrap too. Peace out.

And goodnight. Give it up for him, folks. Thank you very much.



I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back

They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me

This is a beat with no words at first, its a blank painting
Exercising the mind, its brain strength training

My motto is live by the bottle
So why is my supply low? Bring in a truckload with a high-low

My name is Chauncey Billups, I'm kind of like a raunchy Phillips
Screwdriver, my crew's live when you can't sleep and you're still up

I came in this game with, bad intentions
And I ain't budged, not even an inch since then

Lava on my lips I flips, wake up think I have a cramp
I'm trying to shove the lava lamp up my father's ass

Got my self esteem back, got my confidence up
I'm gonna step up on this stage now, I'm gonna strut

Shady man, I done told you once homie to easy up
But you just wont listen will ya? Nah, I guess not



[Intro]
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, suin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though."
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammalswell, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee."
I should download her audio in MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: "How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"
It's funny, cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Outro]
Ha ha, I guess theres a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, lets all stand up!

We ain't nothing but mammals -- well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other rappers open like antelopes

Well, I do; so he sucks and so do you
You think I give a damn about a Grammy
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me

Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here

[Verse 1 - Eminem]
There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again its the, illest and realest killas
The most villainous, Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's
Not over till we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Will keep spinnin', this is Hip Hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, Hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep sticking them pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
He's already reconciled with his {ex}, a chainsaw and an axe
Choke a bitch to death, strangle her neck
While we have sex, while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the facts, yeah, bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect, I never left, baby, I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zie automatically
Says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it, I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this whack ass rap, kiss my black ass!

[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]
Nah, Em, tell them to kiss my black ass, the clean parts, the shitty parts
My bullet wounds, my beauty marks, the Fif'll tear you're ass apart
I came in this game crushin' motherfuckers from the start
Shady paid me, Shady crazy, Fifty crazy rich, bitch
Different day, nothing change, it's the same shit, trick
Teflon wrapped on, case I get clapped on
D's searching the whip, glad I left the MAC home
Still grinding, still shining, nigga lord knows
You rocking with the kid to spit sicker sick flows
I carried Game's style for nine months and gave birth to it
Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it
Everyday Dre day, front and cause a melee
Turn the town upside down with a frown upside down
I smile through something fowl, and watch my money pile
I'm fucking with straight stacks, I'm kicking you straight facts
I hit you with it, bag it, pump it, bring me mines right back!

[Hook - 50 Cent (Eminem)]
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Go 'head front, get fucked up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!
Now boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, I hit your ass up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up! (Yeah!)
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, (It's the Re-Up!)
Shady, Shady



[Intro]
*Plane crash*
Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah

[Verse]
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when Im talkin, lil' bitch
Im sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck yall are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adis
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe "Stan" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L ("Evil" spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, "Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fuckin' industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
"Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orangeoh my God, that's a reach!"
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
"Dawg, that's a date."  "Looks like an olive to me."
"Look, there's an apple!"  "No, it's not, it's a peach!"
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, "Only when it comes to ink and lyricists."
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eatin' a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners



[Intro]
*Schianto Aereo*
Yeah (Illa)
Yo, scriver solo le prime cose che mi vengono in mente, e vedo dove mi porter farlo, perch ora mi sento come se volessi prendere a pugni il mondo intero
Yeah

[Verse]
Lasciatemi spiegare come creare la grandezza
Dritti fuori dal cancello, sto per romperlo
Non sono permessi errori, ma state sicuri, sto per
Stuprare l'alfabeto, potrei far alzare qualche sopracciglio
Se insisto sul problema solo per sfogarmi (Brrr!)
L' intera rivista potrebbe mandare via Staples
Selvaggio, ma non penso a nessun conto in banca
Ma troia, Sono libero dalle catene come Kala Brown
Testa di cazzo, chiudi la cazzo di bocca quando sto parlando, troietta
Aspetta scusa, qual' il tuo talento? Oh, criticare
Il mio talento? Oh, troia, non so chi cazzo siate voi tutti
Per scrivere una barra schifosa o avere addirittura un' opinione o un pensiero
Parli di me, milioni di visualizzazioni, attenzione nei telegiornali
Parlo di te, sconfitta sicura per me, vittoria certa per te
Miliardi di visualizzazioni, i tuoi dieci centesimi sono due
Skippi la musica per scrivere recensioni di merda
Per fare visual, ma troia, hai solo acceso la miccia
Non farti ingannare, come sempre
La lista della merda  rinnovata, quindi trovati qualche merdata da fare
O fatti dissare perch sinceramente non capisco
Che cazzo di merda ti stai ascoltando
Hai la minima idea di quanto odio questo schifoso flow
Quindi lo copiano tutti? Probabilmente no
Levate questo cazzo di audio dalla mia Audii, yo, adis
Capisco perch alla gente piace Lil Yachty, ma non a me comunque
Non sto nemmeno dissando, semplicemente non  per me
Semplicemente quello che sono  un emcee
Forse "Stan" non  la tua tazza di t (Capito?)
Forse la tua tazza  piena di sciroppo e t dimagrante
Forse ho bisogno di fomentare sta merda, preferibilmente
Far tremare il mondo se dipendesse da me
Paul vuole che mi calmi, voi tutti volete che sia pazzo
Dovrei prendermi una pillola, probabilmente lo far
Il vecchio me ha ucciso il nuovo me, guardatelo morire dissanguato
Alito sullo specchio, non vedo il mio respiro
Forse sono morto, devo essere posseduto
Come una magia malvagia, Sono E-V-I-L (compitato EVIL)
Blocco una striscia sbiancante della Crest sulla punta del cazzo
Con un punteruolo da ghiaccio, lo metto in una tenaglia
Lo appendo ad un recinto appuntito, lo colpisco con una chiave inglese
Mentre prendo le mie palle e le smuovo su e gi come un interruttore della luce
Come il vicepresidente Mike Pence
Passo sopra le mie palle con una Sidekick  mentre le lascio su una striscia chiodata
Queste sono le cose che farei piuttosto che sentirvi rappare
Visto che il 90% delle vostre rime parlano di gioielli e
Ges Cristo, amico, quante volte
Qualcuno vorr farsi la mia troia? (fatti la mia scopamica!)
Non vedrete mai un Em ingioiellato
Ma talmente freddo che non appena prendo il M-I-C
Polarizzo merda, tanto che il Tamigi potrebbe congelarsi
Ed il vostro cranio potrebbe spaccarsi in due come se vi fossi passato sopra
Stronzo, faccio venire gi il locale come un manganello  (S)
Perch abbassare il volume?
Non  abbastanza alto, no alza il Valium!
Perch non ho idea di come farvi chiudere il becco
Ora che non ha importanza il livello
A cui rappo, scommetto centomila bigliettoni
Ve ne fregherete e sarete tipo, "Amico,come cazzo
La fighetta impazzir solo perch il suo album fa schifo
E ora vuole prendersela con noi." (Ooouuu)
Ma la settimana scorsa, un ex-fan mi ha spedito una copia
Del Mathers LP per dirmi di studiarlo
Mi aiuter a ritornare me stesso e mi amer (Oooouuu)
Ho risposto alla puttana e ho detto che se avessi fatto cos
Sarei semplicemente come tutti gli altri nella fottuta industria
Specialmente una fottuta copia di me ai tempi di recovery (NFing)
Quindi sfondare una fica con le dita, alette di pollo, MGK, Iggy zae
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitano Lil Wayne
Dovrei dare addosso a tutti in questo business, scegli un nome
Mi sono stufato di essere umile
Ho sentito che volete brontolare come uno stomaco vuoto
Ho sentito i vostri borbottii, ma  tutto un miscuglio senza senso
Lera da cui provengo vi sfonder di pugni, questo  ci che accadr
Che cazzo farete quando arriver?
Vi sbricioler e poi mi far una cagata
E ve la lancer addosso, a meno che non siate Joyner
Kendrick o Cole o Sea siete finiti
Sto per portarlo a tutti quelli che lo vogliono in questo game
Immagino che quando andate da BK vi aspettate di trovare un Whopper
Potete ordinare un Quarter Pounder quando andate da McDonalds
Ma se state cercando una bistecca  meglio che prendiate Revival
Ma vi comportate tutti come se provassi a servirvi un mini-hamburger
Forse le vocals dovevano avere l'auto-tune e in quel caso le avreste comprate
Ma dire che non ho pi abilit
Perch vi siete persi un verso e non lo avete mai capito
Perch  andato oltre le vostre teste, perch siete troppo stupidi per arrivarci
Perch siete mentalmente ritardati, ma fate finta di essere i pi svegli
Con la vostra esperienza e conoscenza, ma non sarete mai artisti
E sono pi duro con me stesso di quanto lo potreste essere a prescindere
Quello che non sar mai  perfetto, tutto ci che sar  onesto
Anche quando non ci sar pi diranno che l'ho portato
Anche quando raggiunger i quaranta come un cazzo di alcolista
Con una bottiglia di malt liquor
Ma non potevo pi sopportare questa merda
Il fatto che so che finir a fondo
Se non mi tiro fuori dalla morsa della sconfitta e mi rialzo in piedi
Non capisco nemmeno perch voi tutti abbiate cominciato a prendervela con me
Finisco nei beef, i miei nemici muoiono
Non cesso il fuoco almeno fino a che non sono tutti morti
Sono delleastside, mai fatto beccare quando sono rilassato
Ora capite perch non dormo, non abbasso nemmeno le palpebre, non batto ciglio
Non mi stanco, manco annuisco ai beat
Nemmeno chiudo i miei fottuti occhi quando starnutisco
Dai, amico! La tua performance al BET cypher era debole, era spazzatura
La Cosa non  nemmeno arancione  o mio Dio, hai esagerato!
Urlo a tutti i daltonici
Tutti e ognuno di voi, se dite che un camion dei pompieri  color acquamarina
O pensate che lacqua sia rosa
Amico, quello  un dattero. A me sembra un'oliva.
Guarda, quella  una mela! No, non lo ,  una pesca!
Quindi ancora, sfondare una fica con le dita, Pootie Tang
Burger Kang, Gucci Gang, cacca, diamine
Charlamagne odier comunque, non importa cosa dico
Dammi il Donkey of the day
Che bel modo di cominciare per questo 2018
Ma dir tutto quello che voglio dire
Benvenuti al mattatoio, stronzi! (yeah)
Invitali come una One a Day
Non ho finito (ben detto)
Perch mi sento come una bestia da soma
Quella riga nella sabbia , ne valeva la pena?
Perch il modo in cui vedo la gente voltarmi le spalle
La fa sembrare inutile, sta perdendo il suo scopo
Vedo la mia fan base farsi in tre parti
E stavo solo provando a fare la cosa giusta, ma gira voce
Che il giudizio dellopinione pubblica  arrivato ad un verdetto
Oppure deve ancora essere determinato?
Perch sono determinato ad essere me stesso, criticato o venerato
Ma se potessi tornare in dietro, almeno lavrei detto in un altro modo
Avrei detto che empatizzo con quelle persone cui questo serpente malvagio
Ha venduto quel sogno che ha disertato
Comunque penso che vada bene cos
Questi miei versi lo stanno rendendo un pochino nervoso
Ed  troppo spaventato per rispondermi a parole
Perch sa che sarebbe liricamente assassinato
Ma almeno so che le ha sentite
Perch Agente Arancione ha appena mandato i Servizi Segreti
Ad incontrarmi per vedere se davvero penso di fargli del male
O se sono collegato ai terroristi
Io ho risposto, solo quando si ha a che fare con linchiostro e con i liricisti
Ma la mia specialit sono pi i giornalisti dei media
(aspetta, aspetta, aspetta)
Ho detto che la mia carne  pi succosa, un giornalista
Pu avere un bel boccone di carne
E s, intendo prendere in bocca un cazzo
Perch loro hanno insultato a morteil mio album
Quindi ho mostrato il dito medio ai media
Non voglio trasformare il tutto in una seduta terapeutica
Ma mi hanno messo sotto torchio
Quindi non la faccio finita con la stampa
E faccio a pezzi questo beat



[Intro]
It's all bad now, man, it's all bad
But y'all done fucked up now
Yeah! Haha! New shit!
Ayo, I just want the whole world to know
That I did not start this, but I will finish it

[Verse]
Comin' up, it never mattered what color you was
If you could spit, then you could spit
That's it, that's what it was
Back when motherfuckers was straight backpackin'
Cipherin', fightin' for life in this rap
For the mic to get passed, and you psyched and you gassed
Then you hype, cause you last
And you might whoop some ass; if you lost, then you lost
Shake hands like a man and you swallowed it
When the Unsigned Hype column in
The Source was like our only source of light
When the mics used to mean somethin', a four was like
You were the shit, now it's like the least you get
Three and a half now just means you're a piece of shit
Four and a half or five means you're Biggie, Jigga, Nas
Or Benzinoshit, I don't even think you realize
You're playin' with motherfuckers' lives
I done watched Dre get fucked on The Chronic
Probably cause I was on it
Now you fucked me out of my mics twice, I let it slide
I said I wouldn't hold my fuckin' breath to get a five
Shit, I was right, I'da fuckin' died already tryin'
I swear to God, I never lie, I bet that's why
You let that bitch give me that bullshit review
I sat and took it, I ain't look at the shit, we knew
You'd probably try and fuck us with Obie and 50 too
*Spit* Fuck a relationship! We through!
No more Source to street cred, them days is dead
Ray's got AK's to Dave Mays's head
Every issue there's an eight-page Made Men spread
Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head
That I am not afraid of this fuckin' waste of lead
On my pencil, for me to write some shit this simple
So, listen closely, as I break it down and proceed
This old G's about to get smoked like rolled weed
You don't know me or my motherfuckin' mother
You motherfuckin' punk!
Put me on your fuckin' cover just to sell your little sell-out mag
I ain't mad, I feel bad, here's an ad
Here's a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad
You wanna talk about some shit
That you don't know about, yeah?
Let's talk about how you're puttin' your own son out there
To try to eat off him because you missed your boat
You're never gonna blow, bitch, you're just too old
No wonder you're sore now, lordy, you're bored now
I'm pushin' 30, you're kickin' 40's door down
Bitch, this is war now, and you'll never beat me
All you do is cheat me out of Quotables
But you know that you'll always see me on your TV
Cause you've got to stay up 'til three in the morning
To see your video played once on BET
So, hee hee hee, who has the last laugh? Aftermath, yeah
So, on behalf of our whole staff, kiss our asshole cracks
We'll never fold or hold back
Just know that Benzino's wack; no matter how many times I say his name, he'll never blow, jack
You're better off tryin' to bring RSO back
Look at your track record, that's how far it goes back
It's extortion, and Ray owns a portion
So, half of the staff up there is fresh out of jail from Boston
Bullyin' and bossin' Dave like a slave
They completely brainwashed him, and forced him to stay
Locked in his own office
Afraid of the softest, fakest, wannabe gangsta in New York
And it's pitiful, cause I would have never said shit if you'd
Have kept your mouth shut, bitch, now what?
Hit it, Clue! Spit it, Slay! New shit, Exclusive
Yo, Lantern, yo Whoo Kid
You know what to do with this
Use it, I'm through, this is stupid
I can't believe I stooped to this bullshit to do this
And who you callin' a bitch, bitch? You owe me!

[Eminem]
I fucking hate you, I can't stand you
I'll rip your titties off, and them, I'll hand you
You're ugly, you won't hug me, you're dumb, you're stupid
I'm fat, lazy and crazy, you think I'm Shady?
I am Shady, you stupid bitch
Take your silicone implants, now you gotta Slim chance of
Fuckin' with me ever again
I got your silicone, you can't fuck with me
But I'm still alone, in my cell, mad as hell
Might as well give you some more shit to sell
Fuck!



[Intro]
It's the calm before the storm right here
Wait, how was I gonna start this off?
I forgot oh yeah

[Verse]
That's an awfully hot coffee pot
Should I drop it on Donald Trump? Probably not
But that's all I got 'til I come up with a solid plot
Got a plan and now I gotta hatch it
Like a damn Apache with a tomahawk
I'ma walk inside a mosque on Ramadan
And say a prayer that every time **** talks
She gets her mou ahh, I'ma stop
But we better give Obama props
'Cause what we got in office now's a kamikaze
That'll probably cause a nuclear holocaust
And while the drama pops
And he waits for shit to quiet down, he'll just gas his plane up
And fly around 'til the bombing stops
Intensities heightened, tensions are risin'
Trump, when it comes to givin' a shit, you're stingy as I am
Except when it comes to havin' the balls to go against me, you hide 'em
'Cause you don't got the fuckin' nuts like an empty asylum
Racism's the only thing he's fantastic for
'Cause that's how he gets his fuckin' rocks off and he's orange
Yeah, sick tan
That's why he wants us to disband
'Cause he cannot withstand
The fact we're not afraid of Trump
Fuck walkin' on egg shells, I came to stomp
That's why he keeps screamin', "Drain the swamp!"
'Cause he's in quicksand
It's like we take a step forwards, then backwards
But this is his form of distraction
Plus, he gets an enormous reaction
When he attacks the NFL so we focus on that in
stead of talkin' Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada
All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather
Cause a Twitter storm with the Packers
Then says he wants to lower our taxes
Then who's gonna pay for his extravagant trips
Back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?
Same shit that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered
Then does it more
From his endorsement of Bannon
Support for the Klansmen
Tiki torches in hand for the soldier that's black
And comes home from Iraq
And is still told to go back to Africa
Fork and a dagger in this racist 94-year-old grandpa
Who keeps ignorin' our past historical, deplorable factors
Now if you're a black athlete you're a spoiled little brat for
Tryna use your platform or your stature
To try to give those a voice who don't have one
He says, "You're spittin' in the face of vets who fought for us, you bastards!"
Unless you're a POW who's tortured and battered
'Cause to him you're zeros
'Cause he don't like his war heroes captured
That's not disrespectin' the military
Fuck that, this is for Colin, ball up a fist!
And keep that shit balled like Donald the bitch!
"He's gonna get rid of all immigrants!"
"He's gonna build that thing up taller than this!"
Well, if he does build it, I hope it's rock solid with bricks
'Cause like him in politics, I'm usin' all of his tricks
'Cause I'm throwin' that piece of shit against the wall 'til it sticks
And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his
I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against
And if you can't decide who you like more and you're split
On who you should stand beside, I'll do it for you with this:
Fuck you!
The rest of America, stand up!
We love our military, and we love our country
But we fuckin' hate Trump!



[Intro: Eminem]
Only reason I dissed you in the first place
Is 'cause you denied seeing me
Now I'm pissed off

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sit back, homie, relax, in fact grab a six pack
Kick back while I kick facts, yeah, Dresick track
Perfect way to get back, wanna hear something wick-wack
I got the same exact tat that's on Nick's back
I'm obsessed now, oh gee
Is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee?
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I put all them phone calls out
You made to my house when you was wildin' out before Nick
When you was on my dick and give you something to smile about
How many times you fly to my house, still tryin' to count
Better shut your lyin' mouth if you don't want Nick findin' out
You probably think 'cause it's been so long
If I had something on you I woulda did it by now
Oh on the contrary, Mary Poppins, I'm mixin' our studio
Session down and sendin' it to masterin' to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the fuck I do; Mariah it ever occurred to you
That I still have pictures? However you prefer to do
And that goes for Nick too, faggot, you think I'm scurred of you?
You're gonna ruin my career, you better get one
Like I'ma sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt
That made me put up with her psycho ass over six months
And only spread her legs to let me hit once, yeah
What you gonna say, I'm lucky? Tell the public that I was so ugly
That you fuckin' had to be drunk to fuck me?
Second base, what the fuck you tell Nick, Pumpkin?
The second week we were dry humpin', that's gotta count for something
Listen, girly, surely you don't want me to talk
About how I nutted early 'cause I ejaculated prematurely
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurlin'
And said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curlin'
Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassin' me
I'm embarrassin' you and don't you dare say it isn't true
As long as that song's gettin' airplay I'm dissin' you
I'm a hair away from gettin' carried away and gettin' sued
I was gonna stop at sixteen, that was thirty-two
This is thirty-four bars, we ain't even third of the way through
Damn Slim, Mariah played you, Mariah who?
Oh did I say "whore", Nick? I meant a liar too
Like I've been goin' off on you all this time
For no reason, girl, you out your alcoholic mind
Check your wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine
Like I fuckin' sit around and think about you all the time
I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
But fuck it now I'm 'bout to draw the line
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find
On an episode of Cribs, I blow below the ribs
If I hear another word so don't go openin' your jibs
'Cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs
I ain't sayin' this shit again, ho, you know what it is
It's a warning shot, 'fore I blow up your whole spot
Call my bluff and I'll release every fuckin' thing I got
Includin' the voicemails right before you flipped your top
When me and Luis were tryin' to stick two CDs in the same slot

[Interlude: Mariah Carey]
Slim Shady, artful dodger
Slim Shady, artful dodger

[Verse 2: Eminem (& Mariah Carey)]
(I love you) I love you, too
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo
Now what you say? (It's nothing) Yeah so what I'll do
Is refresh your memory when you said (I want you)
Now should I keep goin' or should we call truce?
(You think you're cute, right?) You bet your sweet ass I do
(I'm Mary Poppins, baby) And I'm Superman, ooh
(Mary P; Slim Shady) Comin' at you
So if you'll still be my (Baby girl)
Then I'll still be your (Superhero)
(Oh and Em?) Yeah, I'm right here
(You like this) Nope, not anymore dear
It cuts like a (knife) when I tell you get a (life)
But I'm movin' on with mine, Nick, 'cause that's your (wife)
Well tell her to shut her mouth then I'll leave her alone
If she don't (stick to the script) then I'ma just keep goin'
Damn

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
I see Mary Ann, Mary Ann's saying cut the tape
Cut the tape, knife

I see Mary Ann, Mary Ann's saying cut the tape
Cut the tape, knife



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Things just ain't the same for psychos
Guns and rifles, sharp knifes, I like those
I might just O.D. by the end of tonight's show
With the right dose I might wipe out this light pole
But, the strangest things can happen from jabbin'
Pregnant women in the abdomen so they can't have children
Bitches get slapped up and drastic ass kicks
Gay-bashin' fags with tire irons and ratchets
I seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Versace "Whoa, hey!" Liberace "ho!" (echoes)
I might have bashed of somebody you probably know
Buncha' faggots in your clique screamin' "It's not me! No!"
Drag 'em out the closet and across the floor
Went you paid 'em a visit in the hospital
Stab 'em in the fuckin' tonsils with a popsicle
Stick, and sit back and watch 'em choke

Cause every chair that I throw
People sue me for dough
They press charges on me
Till I cant fight anymore
But every girl that I choke
I got lawyers I know
Who got judges they know
So I suggest you stay home

Ha ha

Damn bitches, I just took some ecstasy
I'm an extraterrestrial lesbian with a...
Ha ha

Cut that shit off, I'm outta here, peace

...Man, whatever

[Intro]
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone...
Fuck it, just shut up and listen
Ayo

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses."
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a "My Name Is"
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        

[Intro]
Yo yo yo yo yo (this is)
This is my motherfuckin' anthem (hip-hop)
To hip-hop music (anthem)
'Cause I'ma keep doin' hip-hop music
Until the day that I die (Until the motherfuckin' day that I die)
Aight, bitch?

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm into voodoo, tarot cards and Ouija boards
Lightin' candles campin' out at haunted beach resorts
I write the dark shit, and rap about perverted violence
Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands
Dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks
Holdin' a rifle, with a life full of drama like 2Pac's
Jumpin' off rooftops drunk after I do shots
Landin' in someone's backyard gettin' chewed up by two rots
I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks
This rap shit got cash comin' out the blue like nude cops
I use to sell pizzas, now I got twelve visas
So tell Jesus that I'ma quit sinnin' when hell freezes

[Hook]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probably why my nights are gettin' colder and my days seem shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
Bitch, till hell freezes over
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes (over)

[Verse 2]
Yo, I used to be too heavy in that cruising Gratiot crap
I think I fucked my head up listenin' to acid rap
I go to parties bumpin' Nasty Nas's new song
And smoke pot 'til I get high and stare at shit for too long
Like this weed is laced, ain't it? It tastes tainted
The whole place fainted, I woke up with my face painted
Spaced out like Sci-Fi TV, "Fuck ICP, buy my CD!" (Yeah)
That's what I'm screamin' while I'm handin' out promo tapes of my debut
Tellin' bitches, "Let me eat your pussy while I shave you!"
Ain't no shame in my game, I turn the party out
Makin' everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth

[Hook]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probably why my nights are gettin' colder and my days seem shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
Bitch, till hell freezes over
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over

[Outro]
Uh (Uh-uh, uh uh-uh, uh uh)
Uh uh-uh uh uh
Ah ah-ah ah ah
Uh uh-uh uh uh
Ah ah-ah ah ah
Uh uh-uh uh uh (Dr. Dre)
Ah ah-ah ah ah
(Slim Shady)
(Outsidaz)



[Intro: Eminem]
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
(Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left)
And when you feel weak (Yo left)
You feel like you wanna just give up (Yo left, yo left)
But you gotta search within you (Right, left)
Try to find that inner strength (Yo left, yo left)
And just pull that shit out of you (Yo left)
And get that motivation to not give up (Right, left, yo left)
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall
(Yo left, yo left, right, left)
Flat on your face and collapse

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fo' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andr from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney  Nate, hit me!

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Outro: Eminem & Nate Dogg]
Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from (Underneath me)
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me



[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I'm givin' mad love, I'm snugglin' hugs
Strugglin' thugs, smugglin' drugs
Jugglin' jobs, guzzlin' jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts
We travel in packs, unravelin' facts
And gravel in cracks to find babblin' max, gafflin' tracks
I grapple an axe for them bafflin' acts
Of mysterious stab-in-the-backs who dabble in wax
Stealin' my art when I sculpt it
The culprit that stole shit'll end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet, I carry the fat shit
Butterfingers is here when it's necessary to scratch it
Baby, all I wanna do is swallow one or two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm droppin' naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience

[Hook]
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right

[Verse 2]
Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandalous
Livin' as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this; I'm the rhyme biter, crime fighter
Caped crusader, takin' care of undeservin' lime lighters
I think we live in era meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread the terror mentally
When I stumbled upon this resolution
By usin' a special fusion
Of chemical solution for this fresh illusion
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I'm armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you'll get socked and pushed
Talkin' that junk like you had Black Bart at your back
Come to battle me and you get smacked hard as you act
When I rep-a-resent it, and will have a referee in it
Every minute, so when I win it you never resent it
I'm forever demented
Come up with funk, I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly sent it

[Hook]
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right

[Verse 3]
Eminem is headed skyward
For those who thought that I would
Make you bored and treat you like a piece of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous
I rap for all you Draculas
And showed you all how wack you was
I meant it as a diss
Cause you don't posses the pizazz of this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
Without you addin' fuel to the fire; I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign and hail rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
There's no one who's identical
To my fresh and authentic flow
I'm sure the party people can agree
That I'm enchantin' rhythm romantically
Freakin' vocals so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here

[Hook]
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right



[Tonya]
Hey! Hey, stop, hey. Please stop, fuck, stop!
Thank God you stopped
Fuck, my fucking OnStar isn't working
I left my fucking phone at home!
God, I've been standing out here for like, an hour
I'm soaking wet, freezing
Thank you so much. Really, you're a life-saver, uh
What are you doing?
Fucking! Get away from me! What the fuck! Fucking asshole!
Get away from me, you motherfucker! Get away!
Get away, you fucking freak! Get away from me!
Goddammit, fuck! Help me!



[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
I'm stumbling, I cant see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again

[Refrain: Skylar Grey]
Now Im the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

[Verse 2: Eminem]
All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Already shot to hell, I'm falling helplessly
I'm embarrassed, I dont want no one else to see
Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, definitely doesnt help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven
But makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me
I'm putty in her palms, Im wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay though
'Cause I know she loves memy friends, what do they know?

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
In my moments of weakness
I openly admit the shit I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her in this war, when she
Gets goin' she don't stop, when I'm up she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
But, somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for
Me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something about her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist, make a believer out of me
And show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain, I'm drowning

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

[Refrain: Skylar Grey]
Now I'm the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

[Verse 4: Eminem]
It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her health
But it annoys her to see me get the strength to say, "Screw her!"
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
And this time this piece of shit's running through her
I can see the light, now I'm running to it
What the fuck? Shoulda knew it!
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she doused the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)



[Intro]
Slim motherfuckin' Shady... alright!
Missy Elliott, Timbo, c'mon, yo!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm homicidal, and suicidal, with no friends
Holding a gun with no handles, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin' tecs at you
Until you see your fuckin' legs
With the bullet holes and the exit wounds layin' next to you
Fuckin' mad dog, foamin' out the mouth
Fuck mouth, my whole house is foamin' out the couch
Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a buildin'
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground (Keep filmin'!)
Woke up to a hospital staff
Got up and laughed
Chopped 'em in half
And suffocated your oxygen mask
Shit, if I get any higher
I'm a get the East and West beefin' again
Fly back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire

[Interlude]
Ken Kaniff: Oh fuck, oh shit
Ken Kaniff: I got the hotel room ready
Ken Kaniff: What time are you getting off, work
(Ken Kaniff: Or shall I say) Eminem: Aight, yo, yo, yo one more time, yo
(Ken Kaniff: What time are you comin' home)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yo, yo, I'm only smilin' when I'm violent
Got on the plane wildin'
Told the pilot to fly me to Tylenol Island
Stewardess like, "You restless?"
"Nah, bitch, I'm restful, so hold this fuckin' jet still so I can eat these pretzels"
Forget school
The other kids are disrespectful
They hold me down and play connect-the-dots with my freckles
I can't take it
I'm tryin' to gain weight
So I eat steak
And swallow the whole plate
And weigh myself, naked
Put out albums
To teach kids family values
'Cause every mom and dad should allow you to pop valiums
And never hit someone unless you got a reason
And if there ain't a reason
Make one up, then start swingin'



[Intro]
A lot of people ask me
Where the fuck I've been at the last few years
Shit, I don't know
But I do know I'm back now
Haha

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Verse 1]
Dre, I'm down here, under the ground, dig me up!
Broken tibias, fibias, yeah, fix me up
Sixty sluts, all of them dyin' from asphyxia
After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixie cups, toxins, boxes of Oxy pads
Enough Oxycontin to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
Wack job in the back in a black stocking cap
Jackin' off to a hockey mask at a boxing match
(He can't say that!) Yes, he can
I just did, faggot, now guess again
Better text message your next-of-kin
Tell 'em shit's about to get extra messy
Especially when I flex again
And throw a fuckin' lesbian in wet cement
Faggoty, faggoty, faggoty! Raggedy Ann and Andy
No! Raggedy Andy and Andy
No, it can't be, it can't beyes, it can be
The fuckin' Anti-Christ is back, Dante
It's Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville, calamity, goddamn it
Insanity, pills, fanny pack filled with Xannies
Through every nook and cranny, lookin' for trannies
Milk and cookies spilled on my silk nglige, looky
Razor-ba-lades with me to make you ba-leed
Cases of Maybelline makeup lay on a table of weed
Slim Shady? Shit sounds like a fable to me
'Til he jumps out of the fuckin' toilet when you're takin' a pee

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Verse 2]
Six semen samples, seventeen strands of hair
Found in the back of a van after the shoot with Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana, prepare to elope with a can opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe on canopy beds
And Glad bags, yeah glad to be back
'Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack-dab in rehab
Fuckin' doctor, I ain't understand a damn word he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton, I ain't enlightened
Bitin' into a fuckin' Vicodin like I'm a Viking
Oh, lightning is strikin', it might be a fuckin' sign I need a psychic
Evaluation, fuck Jason, it's Friday the 19th
That means it's just a regular day (hah!)
And this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fuckin' lesbian shouldn't have had her legs in the way
Now she's pregnant and gay, missin' both legs and beggin' to stay

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Verse 3]
Tell the critics I'm back and I'm comin' to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions, then split a bag of Funyuns
Mad at me? Understandable, cannibal, shoot an animal
Out of a cannon and have 'em catapult at an adult
Captain of a cult with an elite following
To turn Halloween back into a trick-or-treat holiday
Have Michael Myers lookin' like a liar, swipe his powers
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
Hit Jason Vorhees with a 40; stuck a suppository
Up his ass, and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lector a fuckin' nectarine
And sat him in the fuckin' fruit and vegetable section
And gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm Street with a fuckin' Wiffle bat drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands too
And came out with a little scratch, ooh
Lookin' like I got in a fuckin' pillow fight with a Triple F.A.T. goose
Insanity, can it be vanity?
Where's the humanity in having a twisted fantasy
With an arm-and-leg amputee?
Straitjacket with a hundred and eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back
Then they latch it; cut your fuckin' head off
And ask where you're headed off to
Get it? "Headed off to?" Medic, this headache's awful!
This anesthetic's pathetic, so is this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushin' my hard taco

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Outro]
So, it wasn't a choice, it was "I had to do this."
And now I got 90 days clean
And uh, that's all I have to share, thanks
(Thanks for sharing, Brian
Is there anyone else who'd like to share this evening?)
Yeah, I got something to share:
"When you walked through the door you were queer to me
So come here, baby boy, just come here to me
You're a cock-boy, everybody wants you
You're gayer than you would ever claim to
I won't have to rape you
So, homie, lay down, down, down
Lay down, down, down
Lay down, down, down, lay down, lay down."
Where's everybody going?
This always went over real big in Gay-A
Okay, wait, I got another one
"I just love condoms and lots of cum."
No? Well, shit!



[Hook: Eminem]
Chem-le-le-le-le-le-le-le, le-le, le-le
Chem-le-le-le-ne-miah-nuf-niah, ne-nish, ne-ne
Translation:
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young-ass man with a trash can, strapped to the back
Of his ass so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightnin'
And frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital, lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantel
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
(Bitch, it's too late)
Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

[Verse 2: Swifty]
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit your chest like a double barrel gauge and
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remy I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, "Forgive me"
I'm snatchin' every penny, it gotta be that way, nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin', I make the President get a facelift
Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chillin' in the lab wasted, I'm the type
That'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on sight
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

[Hook: Eminem]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!
Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin' your tires, flyin' down Fenkell and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performin'?) Bitch, didn't you read the flyer?
The special invited guest will be Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?) No, bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip, lettin' the record skip (Damn!)
I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pitbull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin'-ass mom

[Verse 4: Proof]
Ayo, flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin' nigga, pass that!
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a "Stop the Violence" rally, I blast gats
BMI on publishin'; get yo' ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up yo' cash stack
Run yo' motherfuckin' pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch, I snatched Shaq's
Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

[Verse 5: Kuniva]
We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin' more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth
And it's polluted; I cock it back, then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players, thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga screamin', "Kuniva, yo, yo!"
I leave ya face leakin', run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin'
Take a swing at the deacon

[Verse 6: Kon Artis]
I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin' them shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin' sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
(Special delivery) I sign to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin' niggas runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin' some ones
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

[Hook: Eminem]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!
Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

[Outro: Eminem]
Ha-ha! Suck my motherfuckin' dick!
D12, Dirty-motherfuckin'-Dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin' husbands
Bizarre Kid, Swifty McVay, the Kon Artis
The Kuniva, Derty Harry, and Slim Shady



[Intro]
Nah, mannot quite finished yet
Haha, woo!

[Verse 1]
Girl, I think you just might've tried
To pull a motherfuckin fast one, Im mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade?
Tryna play games? See this saw blade?
See this silhouette of a stalker in your walkway?
Better cooperate or get sauteed
And rotisseried while youre hog-tied
MCs get so quiet
You can hear a motherfuckin' dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin Fall Guy
I dont gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai
'Cause it will turn into a Gremlin
And run over kids, women, and menVrinn-Vrinn!
Motor so big, you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits, why you cringin?
Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
Will I spend-spend even ten cents on you, since when
Do you think its gonna cost me a pretty penny?
Shit, if I think a pennys pretty
Just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo
Catch an Eskimo by his toe while hes tryin' to roll a snowball
But dont make him lose his cool
If he hollers, better let him go, yall

[Chorus: Sample + Eminem]
"You don't own me"
Now here we go, go, go

[Verse 2]
Get up, baby, get a move on like a U-Haul
You can rack your brain like pool balls
You won't ever think of this shityeah, honey, you called?
Well, here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it
EvilI see, hear, and speak it
Lady, put your money on Shady, fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket
You can count every motherfuckin chicken 'fore it hatches
'Cause you can bet your ass that we gonna get it crackin
Like the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin'
Get your brains bashed in
So bad, you will have Kurt Cobain askin
To autograph a bloodstained napkin
Unfashionable, and 'bout as rational as a rash on a fags asshole
Now lets take that line, run it up the flagpole
With Elton, see if hes cool with it
Dont stand there and look stupid at
Me, bitch, I aint in the mood for this shit
Get my dick, Google it 'til it pops up
Yall are so motherfuckin full of shit that you're stopped up
Me, Im always shittin' diarrhea of the mouth
'Til your speakers crap out Pfft, huh, what?
Girl, you got a hot butt
Like a lit cigarette (chig-chigga-ret-ret)
But you wont get a hot fudge sundae from me
So do not strut my way, slut, because

[Chorus: Sample + Eminem]
"You don't own me"
Now here we go, go, go

[Verse 3]
And now that I got your panties in a bunch
And your bowels in an uproar
I'ma show you why I came, so you stop askin' me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut, cunt, whore, I know you want more
Bitch, its time to put the math back into Mathers
'Cause Im a fuckin problemrun, boy!
Every flow, got it mastered
So every last word that you fuckin fags heard
Comes straight from the fish's ass
Yeah, in other words, Im a bass-turd
Lookin' at me like I killed Kenny, gas in the tank, yeah, still plenty
No morals are instilled in me, so remorse, I really dont feel any
Eat your heart out, Hannibal, understandable why you're jealous
Fuck an animal, I got cannibal magnetism
Can't resist him nowcan you, ho?
Shady, I dont understand your flow
Understand my flow? Bitch, I flow like Troy Polamalus hair, boy
Dont you dare try to follow or compare, boy
Im raw, you aint even medium-rare
Stay the fuck outta my hair, boy
You can look, you can stare, and point
But you cant touch, Im too clairvoyant
I dont get it, man, is there a void?
All this weak shit, what am I, steroids?
Well, bitch, Im back with some shit for that ass
And your trunk, elephant hemorrhoids
And remember, boys

[Chorus: Sample + Eminem]
"You don't own me"
Now here we go, go, go

[Outro]
Thank you for coming out
I hope you enjoyed the show
Until next time;
Peace



Pt. I

[Intro]
Hands up, officer dont shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, its no use
We aint ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

[Verse 1]
Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a...

[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

[Verse 2]
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, whered you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...

[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

Pt. II

[Verse 3]
Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say "Die N-word" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But cant escape the sirens
Dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And were trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devils face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black
"But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats
Single mother strugglin through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be capped in America like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the "Land of the Free" that made people slaves to build



[Intro]
I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like

[Verse 1]
Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', "L-L-L-Let us in!"
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manurehell, I meant Kahla
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, "Hell yeah!"
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the)

[Verse 2]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
When you're bit with the

[Chorus]
Venom, adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the)

[Verse 3]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with myvenom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like aparasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the)



[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, alright, alright
Uh, Slim Shady, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
It's only fair to warn I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4-door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella
To chop a fella to mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in a cellar, with your skeleton showing
Developin' anorexia, while I'm standin' next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your vein feeding you liquid Darvocet
Pumping you full of drugs, pull the plugs on the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants
And given a less than 20-percent chance of livin'
Have a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived to perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'm still alive!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired a arson to set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick so tight you need a crowbar to pry her apart with

[Outro]
Motherfucker! Slim Shady, bitch!
Recognize, for the '99! Album February 23rd!

(dialing tone)



[Verse 1]
Met a retarded kid named Greg, with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with the forty
Mixed it with Alka-Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab, I strapped the whole sheet to my forehead
Waited until it absorbed in, and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers, we blowin' up your house, killing your parents
And coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doin' drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack today, yesterday, and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a Labrador
Strappin' more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin' together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure!
Motherfucker!



[Intro]
Its like this and like that and like this (x2)

[Verse 1]
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless
Patrolling corners, looking for hookers
To punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Sr. and smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed but kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed ninth grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now



[Verse 1: Venom]
I am Venom!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
Em? What's wrong with you, no no no!!!!



[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa shizzel, my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzels forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andr from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney  Nate, hit me!

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so

[Outro: Eminem]
Yo, yo, yo, yo



[Chorus: Beyonc & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (Fuck)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I cant reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the marks high, butter
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because

[Chorus: Beyonc & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the, it's the curse of the)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I havent spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
Ive garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, "This shit is garbage!"
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and its exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so

[Chorus: Beyonc & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's, it's true)
But only when it freezes
(It's true)

[Post-Chorus: Beyonc]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik'sa beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex
pectations and meet 'em, but first
The "Speedom" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause

[Chorus: Beyonc]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Post-Chorus: Beyonc]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote "Stan"



Walk On Water

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?

A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as

And now I'm gettin' frowned and clowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Post-Chorus: Skylar Grey]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote "Stan"

Stan

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Love the Way You Lie

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it, Wait!
Where you going?, I'm leaving you. No, you ain't
Come back! We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snap, Who's that dude?, I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie



[Intro]
Woooo! It's Shady aka the Army Shady Records
Break it down

I do a lotta spittin' and I don't gotta try
But I ain't got rhymes to waste so let's make it
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop something

[Verse 1]
I got a friend of mine, named 50 Cent I signed
This shit's official now, the deals is finished and it's time
To get down to this business, let's get these nicks and dimes
So hurry up and cop, G-Unit shit before it's gone
Its like a gold mine for my man to take nine
And bounce right back, he gotta be like Michael Myers
This shit must be a sign, these labels must be blind
Columbia, I know this must be fucking with they mind
They know they 'bout to cry cause they missed out
But I know how to get the dough cause Dre gave me a business mind
I said in my line, I hit 'em with a nine
I had a empty clip but they ain't check the chamber

[Chorus]
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop somethin'
But you gon' feel my shit, you gonna hit the stop button
We fuck you up a long time, you gon' get stomped stuntin'
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop somethin'
But you gon' feel my shit, you gonna hit the stop button
We fuck you up a long time, you gon' get stomped stuntin'

[Verse 2]
Damn 50, this shit's about to hit the fan 50
Fuck happened to Ja?
He got the sickest vendetta, he must think that you betta
He bought to play with his paper, you gonna fuck with this chedda
Now homie think we gon' sweat 'em but we just gon' forget 'em
If he don't shut up we'll dead'em, let Yayo stomp his head in
It's all good cause we'd rather rap then to let a
Pussy play us outta pocket homie, so tell 'em
He better be easy
Start some bullshit, he'll get his whole crew wet
D-Twizzy, Obie, 50 Cent and G-Unit
Yo, he don't want it cause he's always drugged out
You won't see one picture where his pupils ain't bugged out

[Chorus]
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop somethin'
But you gon' feel my shit, you gonna hit the stop button
We fuck you up a long time, you gon' get stomped stuntin'
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop somethin'
But you gon' feel my shit, you gonna hit the stop button
We fuck you up a long time, you gon' get stomped stuntin'



[Intro]
There's an intruder in my house
He cut my phone line: can't dial out
I scream for police, but I doubt
They're gonna hear me when I shout

[Verse 1]
A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail
But this time, when I get pulled over
There's a Doberman Pinscher and a Pit Bull in the seat
These pigs'll get bit foolin' with me, quit foolin' with me
Bitch, you're gonna see, no pistol in the seat
Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me?
And which you're gonna see
In the long run, I'ma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass  where was you at
Last night when them assholes ran up on my grass?
Rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm 'posed to fight with, bare palms?
Yeah, right! They comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns; we as Americans

[Hook]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta' protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves
Livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves
Look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 2]
I make beaucoup bucks, wearin' beaucoup vests
Drama hangin' over my head, like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
With you-know-who, with an S tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I've got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it 50-50 on 50
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin' quicker
Than makin' paper airplanes out of a 20
Fuck money! I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President [dead]
It's never been said, but I set precedents
And the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda' been "Bastard"
The shit shoulda' been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda' been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot  fuck that shit!
I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time, they got the fucking automatic
Ain't no one gon' test this man  clack-click!

[Hook]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta' protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves
Livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves
Look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live
This (Sshhhhh!) is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 3]
I got a secret, if you can keep it between us
I tuck two nina's under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my long johns, under my Sean Johns
One run-in with the long arm of the law, I'm long gone
I'ma do five years  no less than that, no questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' give me my semi, but I got my weed back

[Hook]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta' protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves
Livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves
Look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America, and we are Americans



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo, weed lacer, 97 burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary, had to ditch the Mercury Tracer
Im on some loced shit, some fed up with the bein broke shit
Im not to joke with, bitch I dont sell crack, I smoke it
Havin' a coke fit, goin' through withdrawals daily
Shoot up with mescaline in front of my baby daughter Hailie
My brains dusted, Im disgusted at all my habits
Too many aspirin tablets, empty medicine cabinets
Losin' battles to wack rappers cause Im always too blunted
Walkin up in the cypher smokin, talkin about Who want it?
Thug and a crook; every drug in the book Ive done it
My 9s at your brain, is that you chain? run it
Crews die from an overdosage of excessive flavor
Aggressive nature got me stickin you for your Progressive pager
Spectacular, battle rap manufacturer
Stole your mommas Acura, wrecked it, and sold it back to her
Boostin Nike jackets, escaped from psychiatrics
Told the nurse to save my bed for me, I might be back trick
So barricade your entrance, put up some extra fences
A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses
Chasin dips  take em on long vacation trips
Kidnappin em and trappin em in abusive relationships
Mess up your face and lips, slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Gut you with that razor that I use to shave my nuts with
Mama, dont you cry, your son is too far gone
Im so high, I dont even know what label Im on
Im messed up, I feel just like an overworked plumber
Im sick of the crap, whats Jack Kevorkians phone number?



[Hook]
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange

[Verse 1]
Got a dick as big as a banana
I try to control it but I guess I can't
It shoots off like an AK-clip banana
You better watch out, Hannah Montana
Man, what's the matter, have you no manners?
No you know the girl from Juno's address
Yeah, I'ma probably go to jail for that
Now I got the cops on my tail for that
Run up on your car with a stale banana
In your tail pipe, can't believe you fell for that
It could've been a molotov cocktail for that
Wait a minute man, what the hell was that?
I heard a noise, where you going? What are you, bananas?
You can't go back there, stupid ass
I just seen a woman in a Freddy Kruger mask
Who the fuck are you? Superman?
All you have is a little stupid can
Of whipped cream, what the hell you gonna do with that?
I'ma put it on my wee-wee, oh good answer
Super bonanza extravaganza
Man go ahead, what you waiting for?
You better get them clothes off, baby boy
Come on let's go, we're gonna make a porn
Ready, set, go hit play, record

[Hook]
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange

[Verse 2]
Are you ready? You better hold the camera steady
She's probably back there with a damn machete
She's probably gonna eat you like canned spaghetti
She's probably gonna kill you, still wanna check, see
Have a little quick look, go on sick prick
She's probably six foot tall like Big Foot
The hell with that, we probably should run
Don't dare look back, we probably, probably
Probably, there probably was a problem
At the post office or something
But you probably didn't know that, did you?
Now what you gonna do when she gets you?
I ain't going with you, forget you
Quit tryna hold my hand, mister
Pretend she's your little sister, little sister
Might as well take the whipped cream with you
And when you see her, make sure you get a picture
We could try to make another Blair Witch movie
A beastiality porno with smoothies

[Hook]
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange

[Verse 3]
It's eerie, but here comes Zack and Miri
Beauty and the Beast, his back is hairy
But she don't care, they're attractive, very
Very sexually active, very
No, Zack, don't go back in there
It's too late now, she's grabbin' hair
He screams, bloody Mary, grabs a mirror
But stop just ain't in her vocabulary
Get off me, please, get off me, stop
Balling back at a coffee shop
They go non-stop, she says go
He says no, she says oh
Back and forth, they scream and shout
Yeah, boy, let them demons out
It's the kind of nightmare you dream about
Uh-oh, now the whipped cream is out
I get sick thoughts, sick, sick, thoughts
Things you could do with your lipstick gloss
Put it on my dick 'til the tip looks orange
Bitch, keep goin', bitch, keep goin'

[Hook]
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange

[Outro]
Banana
Banana
Banana
Banana
Banana

[Intro: Proof]
Yeah Soul Intent, checking in
#1 baby this week
You know what I'm sayin'?
This is M.C. Proof

[DJ Head]
And DJ Head!

[Proof]
Checkin' in on W.E.G.O
You know what I'm sayin'?
Ay yo we got the #1
Requested song, of the day
Coming up next
It's a local 313 talent
He goes by the name of Eminem
And it's called "It's Okay"



[Intro: Eminem]
Guess who? D'you miss me?
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
Youre the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
Youre a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
Were the ones who made you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Ahem, back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
"Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans!"
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then squish it, then pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can-can; don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a 2; you're practically a 10
I know you want me, girl, in fact, I see you grin
Now come in, girl!

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
Youre the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
Youre a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
Were the ones who made you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and charley-horse her
Sorry, Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres have that I don't?
Are you telling me tenderness?
Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner, then
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile; they got style, but it isn't Slim

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
Youre the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
Youre a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
Were the ones who made you

[Bridge: Eminem]
And that's why, my love
You'll never live without
I know you want me, girl
'Cause I can see you checking me out
And baby, you know
You know you want me too
Don't try to deny it, baby
I'm the only one for you (*fart*)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Damn, girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal, but
Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (Blup!)
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
"Lord, help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!"
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
Now break it down, girl

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
Youre the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
Youre a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
Were the ones who made you

[Outro: Eminem]
So baby
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, get down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, get down
Oh Amy! Rehab never looked so good!
I can't wait, I'm going back
Ha-ha, woo!
Dr. Dre! 2020!
Yeah!



[Ad-Lib: Eminem]
Shady
We're back!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Nothing can stop and nothing can change it
You better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think you the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no, ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say "one of the best"
I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay-Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
They'll name me somewhere down at the bottom
Right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay-Z
"Ayo his verses were crazy, on that 'Renegade,' b!
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady"
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the radi
O, and they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And that very well maybe the same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends, which has amazed me
Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it bigbabigbig baybababy

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryna get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately my stakes get better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin the 8V at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing, no choice I chase cream, so

[Ad-Lib: Eminem]
Shady (Stat Quo!)
We're back!

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed
My kids would it fulfill all my family needs (c'mon)
I treat the mic like the block, fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I receive by rolling back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
And tell him "suck my dick," I take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin' shit, nigga, I run me (I run me!)
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
That same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be askin' where I be
Dawg, I'm out in Hawaii, don't like it? Drink my pee
Record song for the "Detox" LP
Feet don't fail he
Niggas got me bent like Cranberry and Belvee
I'mma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon' tell me?
A-Town's entre Aftermath, Shady!

[Ad-Lib: Eminem]
Shady (Bobby Creek!)
We're back!

[Verse 4: Bobby Creekwater]
Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check, pimp for what it's worth, I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't right yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified 'till I show I
Go out on a limb with Em, 'cause I'm with him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
(None of them) stand a chance, at the dance without a bowtie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a chauffeur because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the epitome
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga, I'm just livin me
We the reason for the season
So I'm breezin through the track, nigga

[Ad-Lib: Eminem]
Shady!
(Ca$his!)

[Verse 5: Ca$his]
I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
'Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth, to the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in a midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way, I'mma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected gettin weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Pro-sac, D's and E-Pills, it's a rap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back
Nigga

[Ad-Lib: Eminem]
Shady, (Ha! I told you we was back!), we're back!

[Outro]
Haaaaaaaaa! *Fart*
(What?)



[Verse 1: Champtown]
Get your rusty ass over 'fore I put a shine to it
See man, it's man I trust so I'mma rhyme to it
20% out of a hundred groups are mediocre
They took a medicine effect and I'm a pretty choker
So once you got a couple microphones well I'mma rep 'em
You got some Nile rapper rivers too, well I'mma check 'em!
Because they new to this, I'm true to this!
They shouldn't be doin' this
A lot of rappers reppin' keepin' miles is a few in this
Game, to maintain, I keep it going on
You hear the guitar and the funky beat I'm flowin' on
I don't tell 'em when I see it, I just spot it
Just runnin' me, have soul and ain't the only person got it
And blacks don't have to act white if they like Red Hot Chili Peppers
And whites dont have to act black if they like Salt-n-pepa
Cause I like a lot of people [?] mucus on the [?]
So I'm Blackened like Metallica, look at me in shock
But nothing, else matters wherever I may roam
The microphone's my best friend and the stage is my home
Our music got the sounds, our rhythms got the hooks
I listen to Kenny Rogers, Marvin Gaye and Garth Brooks
I listened to that [?] that's [?] and [?]
But music is good music, the other, is mess
The [?] you chocolate and a peppermint
What color is my soul? Here's a hint: let's hook 'em



Lyrics will be available when/if the song is released. Stay tuned!

[From snippet]

[Hook]
Tell me what time, what time, what time
What time you sucking it?
What time you sucking it?
Tell me what time (tell me what time)
What time, what time
What time you sucking it?
What time you sucking it?



[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you were their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"Daddy, look what I made!" "Dad's gotta go catch a plane"
"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?"
"I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself"
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

[Verse 2]
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
"You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?"
"Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more" "Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!"
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
"Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!"
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', "You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!"
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!"
But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'."
But baby, wait!  "It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real."
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, "Die, Shady!" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

*Curtains closing*



[Intro: Bizarre]
Music, reality
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers
Have a responsibility to these kids
Psych!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If I were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow, or show love? Or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter
If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin'
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate, I done came way
Too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smokin' crack?
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down, run myself in the ground
'Fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryna smack this one out the park: five-thousand mark
Y'all steady tryna drown a shark; ain't gon' do nothin' but piss me off
Lid to the can of whoop-ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull a piece out
Fuck shootin', I'm just tryna knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch; let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap, motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
Yo, Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that
Man, I hate this crap, this ain't rap
This is crazy, the way we act when we confuse hip-hop
With real life when the music stops

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
Ain't no gettin' rid of McVay, if so, you would've tried
The only way I'm leavin' this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically; arrived back at my enemies'
Crib with Hennessy, got drunk then I finished him
I'm every nigga's favorite archenemy
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly, with a Dillinger
In the dark, diligently, I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up, mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper, I wish a nigga had a grenade
To squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
I'll murder you; I gauge and have me turn into
A mad man, Son of Sam; bitch, I'm surgical
I'm allergic to dyin'  you think not?
You got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I was happy havin' a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy, but it only made my pain worse
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you, dawg
And you ain't got nothin' left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin' with their hands out, checkin' for your record when it's sellin'
When it ain't, that's the end: no laughs, no friends
No girls, just the gin you drink 'til your car spin
You think, "Damn!" when you slam into the wall and you fall
Out the car and try to crawl with one arm
I'm 'bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder would they even call? When the music stops

[Verse 4: Kuniva]
Let's see how many of your men loyal, when I pull up
Lookin' for you with a pistol, sippin' a can of Pennzoil
I'm revved up; who said what? When lead bust
Your head just explode with red stuff, I'm handcuffed
Tossed in the paddy-wagon, braggin' about
How you shouted like a coward, bullets devoured you, showered you niggas
If I was you niggas, I'd run while given the chance
Understand, I can enhance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me,  just the thought of dyin'
Alone that really irks me, you ain't worthy
To speak thoughts of cheap talk, be smart
And stop tryna walk how Gs walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we playin' tug-of-war with your life
Fuck a tour and a mic, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife
Deliver that shit that coroners like you hype
Poppin' shit in broad daylight, nigga, you're a goner at night
When the music stops

[Verse 5: Proof]
Instigators turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors; wrist to razors
Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk
In the dark, my dogs all bark, like, "Woof!"
Proof, nigga, I'm a wolf
Get your whole roof caved in, like reindeer hoofs
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
The more y'all breathe, shit, the more I moves
It's Hill Street: this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues (Nigga)
Or make the news, bet you all y'all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop, when the music stop

[Verse 6: Bizarre]
Music has changed my life in so many ways
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to "Rock the Bells"
N.W.A said "Fuck the Police," now I'm in jail
'93 was strictly R&B
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci
Michael Jackson  who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight
Flyin' down Sunset, smokin' crack
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
M.O.P. had me grimy and gritty
Marilyn Manson: I dyed my hair blue, and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm goin' in shock
I'm reachin' for the Glock, but the music stops [blam]



[Hook: Eminem]
Whether you rap or you don't rap
Duck 'fore you get rushed
Get stuck fucking with us
'Cause....
We don't give a fuck

[Verse 1: Kon Artis]
Oh, we sound like Em clones, huh?
Where the fuck you think he started at holmes, huh?
Skip the small talk, talking is a risk you take
Kick yo' face 'till yo' head go through this window and break
Break to the 1-9, Denaun cause the gun-line
And collect bank from every weed spot like I'm one time
I'm ain't the remorseful type, I'll drink and still drive prone to hit anything at any given night
Fuck leaving my roots, I'm still in cahoots with nincompoops who shoot out like troops in Beirut
Pull up in a red hearse with Fred Durst dressed like a nurse
With a coach purse screaming he's [?]

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
On my Harley Davidson, I ride down Main Street
I speed with my dad's name on my ass cheek
Gimme your ones and get robbed with a broken gun
Got you doing more dances than Puffy's son
All you groupies that wanna get took
You gotta be 12 years old with a coloring book
And anyone else who wanna get fucked, 'cause
(Yeah bitch, oh shit!)

[Hook: Eminem]
Whether you rap or you don't rap
Duck 'fore you get rushed
Get stuck fucking with us
'Cause....
We don't give a fuck

[Verse 3: Eminem]
We interrupt your little world of perfectness
To bring you the shit to murder conservatives with
To curse and diss, with verses so merciless
These words can just fuck up your high worse than this
{Police Sirens}
I've killed for less, and dumped bodies in the motherfuckin' wilderness
I'm a wildebeest, and I've concealed a piece even after I was busted by Warren Police
You think just because I got caught by these cops once
I'm not gonna carry shotguns to blow your wigs back like hamburgers without any top buns
So many damn murders I can't even count one
Two black guns, I don't know maybe they're Magnums
I don't know what the fuck they're called, I just grab them
12-gauge dumps in a drug-fueled rage, fuck age, still goin' through my "fuck-you" stage
I'm a 27-year-old eleven-year-old, I'mma never grow up, bitch, I ain't gon' ever get old
I'll be sitting here with a cane and a beard
Still insane and as weird as the day I came in here, brain in my rear, yeah
So until I'm wrinkled as Robert Van Winkle, I'mma drop a damn single every goddamn week, people
It's D12, June 19th, so do like me, and go buy three, with no ID
Kids

[Verse 4: Proof]
Now why you wanna play a game with me, dangerously
The outcome's hot, once split your brain in three
Proof with crooked raps, always ask them "What the fuck you lookin' at"?
And invite the hook to scrap
I gave my life to God, nigga, then I took it back
Took it black, this fuckin' gat will leave your cookie cracked
Detroit's derelict arrogant terrorist, straight on you aerospit
Spit at various people, to leave you [?] bloody 'till you're buried with
Every hit was serious, niggas wanna know how murderous the Dirty Harry is
When I'm on your front porch with guns about to bust
'Cause

[Hook: Eminem]
Whether you rap or you don't rap
Duck 'fore you get rushed
Get stuck fucking with us
'Cause....
We don't give a fuck

[Verse 5: Swift]
When they run into Swift they change directions
My shit so tight when hoes hear it they catch a yeast infection
You need protection, you gon' fear it
I snatch away yo' DNA from existence, with no spirit
Give up the carats or see the nine
Fuckin' with mine is like Farakhan chewin' up swine, on Christmas
With a white trailer bitch on his arm, chillin' in Europe, havin dinner with a Uncle Tom
I attack killin', fuckin' hoes like Matt Dillon
Stackin' obituaries higher than Michael Jackson's ceiling
I leaves nobody livin', I got Satan shiverin'
Hate what I'm deliverin', you know the best then send 'em in, crack you with a fifth of gin
You got your men, but they all wearin' skirts like them niggas from Scotland, you hoes are not grim
Don't make me stop in with a mag, and blow yo feet up out yo Top Tens

[Verse 6: Kuniva]
I'm the one they call in to torture ya
Smackin' your bitch and forcin' her in the back seat of an old Corcia
Kuniva's the silent type, but under the silence is a violent life, usually followed by sirens and lights
Get your throat cut by this tyrant's knife, from high as a kite
And my get-a-way driver's drivin' right
Fuckin' with Hans will get you flipped like a baton, the deadliest bombs
Wrap around niggas like Camabons, you know I ain't nothin' to play with
Thinkin' you real like The Matrix, fuckin' with niggas drippin' off self-hatred
I'm on some live shit, rappers be on some "Ready To Die" shit
'Till I put a ice pick, right through they eyelids, fuck heaters, I'll knock you out instead of shootin'
I hit hard, break yo' fuckin' jaw like Resolution
Give up the cash and coat, or get your little brother's classroom smoked
And the substitue gagged and choked
Nigga

[Hook: Eminem]
Whether you rap or you don't rap
Duck 'fore you get rushed
Get stuck fucking with us
'Cause....
We don't give a fuck

[Outro]
D12, June 19th
Do 'shrooms like me
Get ready for it.
Trouble soon, baby
You know it
Tell your mama and your sister too
'Cause we fuckin' 'em



[Intro]
America! Ha ha ha! We love you
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars
For the rights that men have died for to protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to upholdor so we're told
(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)

[Verse 1]
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on

[Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Verse 2]
Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, baby (Ooh, baby!)  Look at my sales!
Let's do the math: if I was black, I would've sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Give me the mic! Show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
"Fuck it," until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
Was prob'ly his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped: sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now? It's

[Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Verse 3]
See, the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
Whose moms prob'ly would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too, because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this, like, "I don't like this note!"
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors workin' 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say "faggot", shit
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The poster child, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for

[Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Outro]
So to the parents of America, I am the Derringer
Aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the *galf* and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you, Ms. Cheney! Fuck you, Tipper Gore!
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have! Fuck you!
Ha ha ha, I'm just playin', America
You know I love you



[Intro]
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Mic check, one-two
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Who would've knew?
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Who would've known?
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Fuck would've thought?
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Motherfucker comes out
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Sells a couple of million records
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd)
And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling

[Verse 1]
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face  what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth
How? Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn them around?
Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out
I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics
While our President gets his dick sucked?
Fuck that! Take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music
This is for your kid's amusement (the kids!)
But don't blame me when little Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents

[Chorus]
Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

[Verse 2]
So who's bringin' the guns in this country?
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun
Through customs over in London
And last week I seen this Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with an Uzi
I see these three little kids up in the front row
Screaming "Go!" with their 17-year-old uncle
I'm like, guidance?!
Ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear?
What about the make-up
You allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse
(Go sit the fuck down, you little fucking prick!)
And "fuck" was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird (Look!)
So read up 'bout how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch
And changed school every three months
My life's like kind of what my wife's like (What?)
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night: Ike
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

[Chorus]
Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

[Verse 3]
I never knew I, knew I'd have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck! Shit! Ass! Bitch! Cunt! Shooby-de-doo-wop! (Oops)
Skibbedy-be-bop, a Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis, horses and hittin' some trees (Hey)
How many retards'll listen to me
And run up in the school shootin' when they're pissed at a tea
-cher? Her? Him? Is it you? Is it them?
"Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!"
Damn, how much damage can you do with a pen?
Man, I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been in my shoes, who woulda thought
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought?
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not

[Chorus]
Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

[Outro]
How the fuck was I supposed to know?



Step right up, i'm about to light up the skyline
So bright i'm about to fuck your whole night up
Light up your glow sticks, go stick a stick in your ass
This is the ghost of christmas past
This is your host, you're supposed to kiss his ass
This is gross, but listen close
Stick your whole nose in his crack then lets one go
And blows your whiskers back, then get a great whole whiff
Cause if you last it out, without passing out
You'll be on the next episode of fear factor
Yea back to, back to what?
I don't know, smack a little child actor's butt
Mike Jackson, what?
What the fuck you want? i got a blunt and some jesus juice
Who needs a excuse these days? the way they rally around
Pedophiles you're lucky i don't pee in your face
I can do anything and apologize for it later
As long as it isn't a racist tape from 88'
That cannot be forgave
If i drank pee for 18 years straight
And eat shit everyday on a porcelain plate
That was shaped like a toilet with a fork, and steak knife
For the rest of my life, i had to watch my wife
Get fucked by Vanilla Ice, twice a day
Cause i said N-I-G-G-A, when i was a teenager
Blah blah Shade-a 45
Shorty let me get your number baby, maybe
I can hump your leg, with something
But it's time for me to go, so i stopped
Jumped in the vehicle, it's like this
Because i



Eminem:
... grab the mic and I am kickin 'em
While I'm getting wicked with the wicked shit
About to be kicking it with ridiculous skits
When I be flipping 'em
Taking mic's and ripping them
When I come equipped to grab
And I stab shit
I stab motherfuckers bad
They go back to the lab
It's like a crack to the crab
Or crack to the crack
It doesn't matter, cause I'm kicking mad data
It doesn't matter who's fatter
Cause if I had a gun, then I would add a whole to your bladder
Kicking the mad fuckin' shit and I ?
Motherfuckers are scared of
In all kind of ways when I rewind blind ...



[Hook: X Ambassadors]
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers'? It's a rare condition
It's what you're sufferin' from when you simply don't care if it's an
80 degree day and there's no frickin' air conditionin'
And you can't see the bitchs hair is frizzin'
'Cause you got the windows up, blarin' the system
In your Chevrolet Prizm
The devil ain't on a level same as him
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism
And imagine him givin' an adjective an ass-whoopin'
So bad they should put his ass in prison
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs
Like they did somethin' to me personally
Used to get bullied, so I'd cut class and ditch it
Now I bully rap, I'm the shit, faggot (Sniff it!)
Cadillac from a K Car
My ass from a hole in the ground, still cant tell 'em a-part
Came straight out the trailer park
Screamin', "I'm proud to shop at K-Mart," and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart, arguin' over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin', I don't give a fuck, I don't play
Bitch, you think you saw this basket first?
You're ass backwards like motherfuckin' Bob and Silent Jay
Illest shit you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
Ripped a gapin' hole in it, flipped out
Ripped down the drapes, tied 'em around my neck
Went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Slipped, fell straight down to the ground
Splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell, got impaled by the gates
Saw Satan, stuck his face in an ashtray
While I sashayed around flames with a match
And I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothin' to do with a scale
Or being gay, little faggot, but by the way
Thoughts are gettin' darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey
Tyler the Creator, and Violent J
It's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face
I'm insane, every rhyme I say
Sons you like an ultra-violet ray
Im sellin' hatred, buffet style, all the shit you can eat
$11.99, so come on and pile a plate!
Im throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme Im spittin' while Im shittin' on competition
In the meantime its always mean time, I'm gettin'

[Hook: X Ambassadors]
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Ive been a career asshole
I dont see why these people always got my back
I done said so much fucked up shit
I was born a mistake, but I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose
Was to beat a beat purplish, slaughter tracks
I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
Im comin' to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong, the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
'Cause that cougar's a MILF
She's the oldest trick in the book, but I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'ma snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed woulda caught a flat
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid
Indigestion, my suggestions Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm runnin' away with the game
It's 'cause I am, don't speculate, spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by with my wicked ways
Lady, you can suck a dick 'til your neck aches
Cry 'til you get puffy eyes, red faced
But I'm leavin' on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
And I'm sick of poundin' a square peg in a round hole
Sorry, another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gon' fit in my storage overhead space
'Cause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words: don't try to put your heart in a headcase
'Cause baby, stable mentally I ain't
I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down
No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me, I think my face is melting
If you felt these migraines
And see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head
If you read my mind, you can see my pain
And you'd see why I be this way
Ever since I was knee-high playin' with G.I. Joes
Told these hoes shut their P-I-E holes, now peep my game
'Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Like a fuckin' (fuckin') echo (echo)
(Psych) Psycho on a cyclone cycle, spiralin', here I go
I'm outta control like no other mic go
Stab you 'til the knife goes  dull
I'm nothin' but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
'Cause I'ma sock it to you!
Dyke ho, you don't like it?
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle
And ride it like a motorbike
I'm finna blow the mic the whole night, so
Strike up the fuckin' maestro, I'm nitro
And hi, ho, hand me my shovel!
I'm liable to dig my hole deeper
And it's off to H-E double hockey sticks, I go

[Hook: X Ambassadors]
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

[Outro/Skit: Eminem & Ken Kaniff]
Ohh, please be empty
Please be empty, please be empty
Thank you, God!
Shit Is that a girl?
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth
And get my balls blew out, and get gay into the A.M.
And lay with eighteen guys naked
And let myself show, let myself show
Buttfuck it, suck it, pull it, tug it
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
So everybody, everybody
Circle jerk, touch my body
Who is that? Where are you going? Come back!
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? Fuck you then!
Blow it out your ass!



[Intro: Obie Trice]
Obie Trice! Real name, no gimmicks (*record scratch*)

[Refrain 1: Eminem]
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

[Refrain 2: Eminem]
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuitsfuck you, Debbie!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, "Bitch!"
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my assyou asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, "Attention please"
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking "this shit, that shit"
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 1: Slim Shady]

It's the Bushman with art in a dart
Its six o clock sharp you hear them dogs startin to bark
And while they're carving a mark in ya arm, with teeth sharper than sharks
Im out in the parking lot stripping ya car for ya parts
Boy I was rhyming when you was mispronouncing my name
Like E-minem, now you look for my tapes and cant find em
Back in the day I'da killed for some radio play
But now im with Dre, and I still dont give a fuck either way
But ima trust Bush to give me a thrust and a push
While these other radio stations are busy playin puss
So look to the next man and if he aint clapping his hands
Throw him in the bush so fast he gets stabbed in his back with a branch
Its 98 the one station that runs town
And two DJs rippin from sun up to sun down
From sun down to sun up
Slim shady still dont give a thumbs down
With three fingers and keep the middle one up
Its 98 WJLB
Watch in October for the Slim Shady LP

[Outro]
Bushman art in a dart
Bushman art in a dart



[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Cadillac Sevilles, coupe DeVilles
Brain-dead rims, yeah, stupid wheels
Girl, I'm too for real, lose your tooth-and-nail
Tryna fight it, try to deny it, stupid, you will feel
What I do, I do at will
Shootin' from the hip, yeah, boy, I shoot to kill
Half a breath left on my death-bed
Screamin', F that!  yeah, super-ill
Baby, what the deal? We can chill
Split a half a pill and a Happy Meal
Fuck a steak, slut, I'll cut my toes off
And step on the receipt 'fore I foot the bill
Listen, garden tool, don't make me introduce you
To my power tool, you know the fuckin' drill
How you douchebags feel knowin' you're disposable?
Summer's Eve, Massengill
Shady's got the mass appeal
Baby, crank the shit, 'cause it's your goddamn jam
You said that you want your punchlines a little more compact
Well, shorty, I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at, man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium
And said, Settle your fuckin' ass down!
I'm ready for combat, man!
Get it? Calm Batman, nah
Ain't nobody who's as bomb and as nuts
Lines are like Mom's CAT-scans
'Cause they fuckin' go bananas
Honey, I applaud that ass
Swear to God, man, these broads can't dance
Ma, show 'em how it's done
Spaz like a goddamn Taz, yeah

[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Girl, shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinson's
Make like Michael J. Fox is in your drawers
Playin' with an etch-a-sketch
Bet you that you'll never guess
Who's knockin' at your door, people hit the floors
Yeah, tonight, ladies, you gonna get divorced
Girl, forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads
With Chris's force like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue, mothafucka
You ain't got a lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores
Makin' cash registers shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest?
I'm an uncooked slab of beef layin' on your kitchen floor
In other words, I'm off the meat rack
Bring the beat back, bring in two extension cords
I'ma measure my dickshit, I need six inches more
Fuck, my dick's big, bitch, need I remind you
That I don't need the fuckin' swine flu to be a sick pig?
You're addicted, I'm dope
I'm the longest needle around hereneed a fix, ock?
I'm the big shotget it, dick-snots?
You're just small pokes, little pricks
Girl, you think that other prick's hot?
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
Before I sit back and let him get hotter
Better call the cops on him quick, fast
Shady's right back on your bitch-ass
White trash with a half a six-pack in his hatchback
Trailer hitch attached to the back, dispatch

[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin'?
Does a bird chirp? Does Lil' Wayne slurp 'zurp
'Til he burps and smoke purp?
Does a word search get circles wrapped around it
Like you do when I come through?
I'd like you to remind yourself of what the fuck I can do
When I'm on the mic
Oh, you're the kind of girl that I could take a likin' to
Psych! I'm spikin' you like a football
Been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse
Got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Give me good brain, watch the wood-grain
Don't want no cum stainbitch, you listenin'?
Tryin' to turn me down, slut, I'm talkin' to you
Turn me back up! Are you insane?!
Tryin' to talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'!
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the saying? Where there's thunder, there is lightning
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations on four separate occasions?
And you can bet your stankin' ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road, took the psycho path
Poison Ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash
So hit the dance-floor, cutie, while I do my duty
On this microphone; shake your booty, shorty!
I'm the shitwhy you think Proof used to call me "Doody"?

[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no



[Intro]
Yeah! Oh! Get up (Where my trash at?)
I said, get up
You know what happens when I'm around, man
Woo! Let's go
Better watch out now 'cause here we come
And we aint stoppin' until we see the morning sun
So give us room to do our thing
'Cause we aint come to hurt no one
So everybody come and get up on the floor now
And grab someone

[Verse 1]
Man, first of all; Im a boss
I just want to get that across
Man, even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like its a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows, spray-painted doors
With the flames on em, Michigan plates, and my name's on em
Baby, Shadys here, come and get him if you dames want him
But he aint stupid so quit tryna run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryna put your claims on him?
'Cause you wont do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
Theres a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now can I get that lap dance?
Shes got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan, we call em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps down
And show this hussy whos the man now get amped, dance

[Chorus]
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party (white trash party)
So lets have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it aint no one but us trash
You dont know, you better ask somebody
'Cause were having a white trash party (white trash party)

[Verse 2]
Pull a fifth of Bacardi from out of my underwear
And walk around the party without a care
Like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Living Dead
And tomorrow I'll probably still be too high to get out of bed
'Til I feel like I been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
I'm mixin' Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot the gift like Im hollering "Die Santa"
Missed the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders
So quit tryna play the wall like you Paul
And get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin'
Makin' it rain for the ladies in the minis
But Im not throwin' ones, fives, tens, or even twenties
Im throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Dennys
From the North, East, and West
But when it comes to them trailers in them South parks
Muffle it, 'cause, homie, that hoods tighter than Kennys
So, ladies, if your belly buttons not an innie, then Im outtie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy
Come on

[Chorus]
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party (white trash party)
So lets have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it aint no one but us trash
You dont know, you better ask somebody
'Cause were having a white trash party (white trash party)

[Bridge]
Now whether youre black, white, or purple
If youre misunderstood
But you dont give a fuck, you aint doin' shit that you should
Long as you know youre up to evil and youre no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep your hood

[Verse 3]
Now honey, dont let them pricks trip
We should make a quick dip
And go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot
'Cause, girlI got a sick whip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift
And make a five-seater, Ill be damned if I feed a chick
It aint like me to split a piece of dry pita
I be the S-L-to-the-I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y
And I dont need a tank top to be a wife beater
Ill rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
Ill tell you now, Im so raw, I still need to unthaw
You feel me, y'all? I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby, a body like thats against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now get up

[Chorus]
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party
So lets have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it aint no one but us trash
You dont know, you better ask somebody
'Cause were having a white trash party (white trash party)

So quit tryin' ta play the wall like you pawlin'
(mi ah di hero di dancehall Marcus Garvey)
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
Cuz as soon as they throw on some R-Kelly I start ballin'(oh)
(Mi dash weh miney pon di gyal dem mi nuh busines)
But I'm not throwin' ones, fives, tens, or even twenties
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes (mi ah throw nannies)
Man I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's
From the north, east and west(oh), but when
It comes to them trailers in them South Parks
Muffle it, cuz homie that hood's tighter then Kenny's (heh heh)
So ladies if your belly button's not an innie then I'm outie
(Now jump inna di s-class fi dadi
C'mon)

[Eminem]
Now you can do this on your own but everyone knows
That no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin but a white trash party (white trash party) (oh)

[Vybz Kartel]
Street vybz a raise high grade a blaze
Drop di bomb gyal al qaeda ways
Weh di yaad gyal weh di yaad man deh
Kartel ah have a badman party (badman party)


[Bridge]

[Eminem]
Now whether you're black, white or purple
If you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck
You weren't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you're up to evil
And you're no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep your 'hood (ah ah awoah)


[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Now you can do this on your own but everyone knows
That no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin but a white trash party (white trash party) (oh)

Street vybz a raise high grade a blaze
Drop di bomb gyal al qaeda ways
Weh di yaad gyal weh di yaad man deh

Party party party



Hand me an eighth, beam me up and land me in space
I'mma' sit on top of the world and spit on Brandy and Ma$e
I'm more than ill
Scarier than a white person trapped in a room with Lauryn Hill
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me
Cause I'mma' still be the Madd Rapper
Whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin', makin' fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back striking at Ford
And you wonder what the hell I need more Vicodin for?
Everybody's pissin' me off; even the No Limit Tank
Looks like a middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No wonder I'm a great danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself?

Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS
Blood dripping from it
Ripping your stomach up from the waist up?
You talk a lotta' junk but you was never ill though
I'm strong enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh
Jumped up, choked a giraffe
Snapped his neck and broke it in half
Waging wars, went on stage
And sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
And wiped my ass with his page in Source
The demon is here, I'm steaming this year
I rip Mystikal's voice box out and scream in his ear
It's not a gimmick trick; it's an image, I live it
Give a damn, I don't know what a damn is to give it
Man I don't think this guy is well, I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail
I'll friggin', I'll friggin', lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself
And bang them stuffs with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and glue your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered a prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itching to leave you disfigured
And stiffer than Chris-stiff-er Reeves
I was teething with strep throat
While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beating your knees
And walking through South Central L.A., bleeding in jeans
Flashing back to being shot and repeating the scenes
On how you just got smoked
And if you do live, you'll be too scared to tell it like a Biggie and Pac joke

The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon, hop out of a Grand Am and land in it hand-standing
Any man planning to battle will get snatched outta his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standing
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this, and you better inhale
Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky
Came home in a frenzy, pushing a ten speed
Screaming to Aunt Peg with three spokes
Sticking outta my pant leg
Forget a headache, give me a migraine, dammit I like pain
And you should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowing you wack, you act up and I'm throwing you
Down a flight of steps then I'm throwing you back up them
If they don't like the track, f- them, the rap struck 'em harder
Than getting hit by a Mack truck and then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'mma' climb the Empire State Building
And get to the last step and still have half left



[Intro]
"What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough, if you will, to be saved, not in a religious sense, but not to constitute what this country at times calls (Yeah) their throwaway children."
"We seem to be approaching (C'mon!) an age of the gross." (*Burp*)
"We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents' station and each generation should do a little bit better."

[Verse 1]
All right, come on, let's cut the bullshit, enough
Let's get it started, let's start addressin' this issue, and open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement and we can discuss
Statements that's made on this tape and its whole origin of
The music that we all know and love, the music we all enjoy
The music you accuse me of tryin' to destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy
On the East Side of Detroit, crossin' 8 Mile into Warren
Into hick territory; I'd like to share a story
This is my story, and can't nobody tell it for me
You have well informed me, I am well-aware
That I don't belong here: you've made that perfectly clear
I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel-Aire shopping center just for stoppin' in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay, there's a bright side, a day that I might slide
You may call it a pass, I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh, them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious so well known tracks

[Hook]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

[Bridge]
I'd roam the streets so much they called me a drifter
Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to
8 Mile and Van Dyke or steal a goddamn bike
From somebody's backyard, and drop it off at the park
That was the halfway mark, to meet Kim had to walk
Back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's
That's about the time I first met Proof
With Goofy Gary on the steps at Osborn, handin' out some flyers
We was doin' some talent shows at Center Line High
I told him to stop by and check us out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head, like, "White boys don't know how to rhyme."
I spit out a line and rhymed "birthday" with "first place"
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit
Where compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line

[Hook]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place

[Verse 2]
My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through
He said that Puma's the brand cause the Klan makes Troops
It was rumors, but man, goddamn, they flew
Musta been true, because man, we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones, the Cool J Ice Lamb, suede too
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next? X Clan debuted
Professor X (Vanglorious!) "Exist in a state of red
Black and green, with a key, sissies!"
Now with this bein' the new trend, we don't fit in
Crackas is out with Cactus Albums, blackness is in
African symbols and medallions represent Black Power
And we ain't know what it meant, me and my man Howard
And Butter would go to the mall
With 'em all over our necks like we're showin' 'em off
Not knowin' at all we was bein' laughed at
"You ain't even half black! You ain't 'posed to have that
Homie, let me grab that! And that Flavor Flav clock
We gon' have to snatch that!" All I remember is meetin' back at
Manix's basement, sayin' how we hate this
How racist but dope the X Clan's tape is
Which reminds me, back in '89, me
And Kim broke up for the first time; she was tryin' to two-time me
And there was this black girl at our school, who thought I was cool
Cause I rapped, so she was kinda eyein' me
And oh the irony, guess what her name was?
Ain't even gonna say it, plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts
And a pair of jugs, the bombest goddamn
Girl in our whole school, if I could pull her, not only would I become
More popular, but I would be able to piss Kim off
At the same time, but it backfired
I was supposed to dump her, but she dumped me for this black guy
And that's the last I ever seen or heard
Or spoke to the "Ole Foolish Pride" girl, but I've heard
People say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was: I singled out a whole race
And for that I apologize, I was wrong
Cause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a

As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place

Fuck out of my house, you fuckin' pieces of shit!
Get the fuck out of my house, you stupid fucker!
You son of a bitch!

Nigga, you front, you gon' get it, okay, now maybe I've said it

You should see when I'm stuntin', I flash the stones to be wantin'

[Verse 2: Eminem]
When me and Fif' got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped
We just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, mi nemesis es su nemesis
Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl
And we all get involved in it
And we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin'
The most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
But tonight we ain't come in here to beef with nobody
We came to party: Banks, Ca$his, and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady, Aftermizath, back in that ass, you izzask?
Come izzon, what kinda fizzuckin' quizzestion is that?

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Eminem]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? I said, you know but you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Verse 3: Ca$his]
Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin'; J.F.K
HK 'til your chest plate cave
I'ma ride to the death, do you rep that way?
Forever I'ma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta
Pussy, I'll survive everything you got in that chamber
I thrive off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad have called me

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa Queens, mixed in with Ca$his creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin' G?
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static
And you splattered, shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all-way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it?
See

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know but you actin' like you don't know
You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Outro: Tony Yayo]
You know who this is
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath
Lloyd Banks, Ca$his, Marshall Mathers, Ferrari F-50
It's a movement, you can't stop it
Talk of New York, Tony Yayo



[Chorus]
The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, Im growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but youre never over

[Verse 1]
If Proof could see me now, I know hed be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, theres somethin' in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, itll be them doors on Dre's Phantom, believe me, clowns
That means "suicide," homie
Youll never throw me off of this course, blow me!
Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, Im not just talkin' awards, homie
And the ball's in my court and its lonely
On top of the world, when youre the only one
With the balls in your shorts
To leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse
'Member that when they get to doggin' you boy, homie
So yall can just get to bloggin' about bologna
Im not gonna stop, the saga continues, no stoppin' the force, Obi
Im moppin' the floors with 'em
I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on droppin' the torch
And it wont be long 'til this sport is O-V-E-R
Just Blaze and me, we are knockin' on doors
And no, we aint pumpkins on Halloween
But well show up on your porch, so be
Careful what you say, there aint no punks over here, so follow me
Through the fog like Im S-N-double-O-P
Let me guide you through the smoke, G
If only I wasnt travelin' down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I dont think you understand how much you meant to me

[Chorus]
The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, Im growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but youre never over

[Bridge]
And it dont stop, oh-oooh
And it dont quit, oh-oooh
And it dont stop, oh-oooh
And it dont quit, oh-oooh
And I miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
And homie, Ill never forget you, nooo

[Verse 2]
For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick itll blow up the mic, itll put the "dyna" in mite
Yeah, itll make the dopest MC
Wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, itll jump off the page and spit itself
Guess that the best thing I can do
Right now, Doody, for you is to rep
So Im gonna fuck 'til I die, yeah, I'ma do it to death
And instead of mournin' your death
Id rather celebrate your life, elevate to new heights
Step on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need two mics
'Cause the way that Im feelin' tonight
Everything I can just do right
Theres nothin' that I can do wrong
Im too strong and Im just too hype
Just finish the rhyme and I bust it
Excuse the corny metaphor, but theyll never ketchup
To all this energy that Ive mustard
So God, just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage
Ive been patiently watchin' this game
Pacin' these hallways, you had faith in me always
Proof, you knew Id come out of this slump
Rise from these ashes, come right back on their asses
And go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'ma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em, homes
Ima own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below 'em
Homie, I know Im never gonna be the same without you
I never woulda came in this game, Im goin' insane without you
Matter fact, it was just the other night
Had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me, "Naw, Doody, youre not!"
Layin' on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it soon as you said, "think of Hailie", I knew
There wasnt no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies
And Proof, not many are lucky enough
To have a guardian angel like you, Lord, Im so thankful
Please dont think that I dont feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need
For one more day to get through
So, homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you, Doody

[Chorus]
The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, Im growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but youre never over

[Bridge]
And it dont stop, oh-oooh
And it dont quit, oh-oooh
And it dont stop, oh-oooh
And it dont quit, oh-oooh
And I miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
And homie, Ill never forget you, nooo



Zane Lowe: Welcome back to Radio One, Maida Vale studio 4 here we are. Part of the reason we're here obviously because its the BBC but also because we have Studio 3 around the corner and you've got the band set up and going to perform some songs as well.

Eminem: It's super exciting to be here. I was trying to figure out how I was going to top the publicity of yours and Kanye's interview so I decided I was going to walk in here, pee on the floor, and leave. I'm peeing right now. Alright see you guys later!

ZL: Seeing you with the band, and seeing you perform the other night at the awards show and seeing you on the mic, it was, I don't think I've ever seen you more alive on the mic. It was full of energy and in the moment. What I noticed was as well was spitting live with the band behind you seemed to free you up a lot more. Are you feeling that way?

E: I think performing has gotten a lot different, it's gotten better with the band because there's just more elements to it and being it is a live show, there's more places you can go with it. There's things you can do with your hands, it's really cool, it's different. I think it's better.

ZL: Spitting Rap God that just puts everything into perspective I think for everybody else. When you wrote that and you got that one down and recorded it...

E: I didn't write that, I freestyled it, off the dome, 1 take.

ZL: Absolutely ridiculous. I mean, the song is ridiculous it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

E: Thank you

ZL: When you get to perform that live that must be, I saw at the end once you finished that, that's a challenge for anybody. At the end you must feel like 'Wow'. That's a lot of rhymes to get through, it's like 5 or 6 minutes non-stop.

E: Um, Yeah the other night I don't think we did the whole song. We did kind of a Deadly Medley.

ZL: I don't even know how you would cut that up and make a shorter version of that because it's such a stream of consciousness through the whole track.

E: Yeah I don't know. I wouldn't even want to begin to think of that, because I think it is a... stream of consciousness. Nice stream of consciousness, running down my leg.

ZL: The album itself has been so well received by everyone including fans across the world. Because in my opinion listening to it now it's kinda the perfect combination of the venom and the danger that existed on the 1st record but also what you've been through and what you've learnt over the past 5 or 6 years. It's kind of like the combination of the two. Is that fair do you think? The first album that feels like it's slightly grown up, but also going back to some of those subject matters and dealing with that stuff.

E: It's grown up and down. I mean some of the themes and topics and things like that are revisited on this album, but at the same time I feel like its kind of a 2013 version. All my albums I think, for the most part, pretty much tell where I'm at, you know at each one at that time period, whatever. So this is kinda like, there's a lot of reflecting and things like that back on everything that was happening during that time, you know. And it's kinda like me reflecting on it and getting to the point where I am now with it.

ZL: Settling some scores as well, and burying the hatchets and dealing with stuff once and for all. Do you feel like this album has allowed you to do that?

E: I mean some stuff, yeah. But for the most part I just felt like it might be fun to just revisit that, the overall vibe of that album. Just because it started to go there in the recording process.

ZL: So when did that begin like you were going down that road?

E: I had started making a few records for it, and it just sounded like the tonality of it, the tones of the records kinda were heading towards that way. And I figured out what direction it should go in, kinda started gearing everything that way. And alotta times, making an album, I dont always have the direction or concept early on. Sometimes it doesn't come until the middle/towards the end of a record to figure out where I'm actually going with that... that's just a culmination of songs, and depending on what the vibe is. Sometimes I do a songs that is so left field one or two of them its like Oh Shit where am I going to put these songs and now what am I going to call it because its not going to make sense to go, let's say Recovery or whatever. But with this one I feel like I kinda got an earlier idea for a concept.

ZL: That must be nice actually to be able to sit down and carve it out as it was going and have that end result in mind, to piece it together that way.

E: It was, but it wasn't, in the sense of-- I had to record a lot of songs for it because I felt like if I'm going to call it that, I want it to make sense.

ZL: And the stakes are high as well. I was talking to someone about this before and they were saying, "Eminem would never consider one of his albums to be a classic" he's not that way inclined. But you know how people feel about the Marshall Mathers LP, it speaks volumes. And then the critics, every layer of it, it is considered a modern day classic album. Did you consider the expectation of calling it that and what it would mean to the record overall?

E: Yeah, I had kinda known that going in. Once I kinda knew what direction I was going, I knew that I needed certain songs to be able to call it that, and like I said to be able to make sense. But, I just wanted to make sure that I had the right ones, and in other words, I knew that, obviously Stan off the first Mathers LP was a big topic. And I had heard a lot of chatter around the time doing the Recovery record that I should do Stan 2 and why doesn't he do Stan 2, and all I kept thinking was Stan's dead. You know what I'm saying, he died in the story. So in the back of my mind I kinda had an idea of who could be left from the story, but I needed to get the right beat and be able to...

[plays song]

ZL: As soon as it starts as well. Did you know immediately this would be the beat for this concept?

E: Yeah, as soon as I heard the words to the chorus... I got this beat, this beat was sent to me and had those words on it. And sometimes for me it's like- I like making my own choruses and its also fun for me to take someone else's words and interpret them my own way.

ZL: For sure, when you hear that chorus I'm sure initially... it's a 1st person scenario or self hatred scenario, but its tied into- there's layers to that. Being bad is good I hate to be it but here I am and I'm back again. And then you got to deal with the story, and at the end it's taking everyone to the end when you couldn't be facing down any more of the criticism both self and by others that you faced throughout your career. I mean it's the ultimate type of acknowledgement isn't it?
Meeting your maker almost really, is that the inspiration behind it?

E: It's kinda like saying, if you're going to go down this road, then you're going to call it this, and this is going to be the title, and this is all of these things coming back on me.

ZL: It's an amazing opening to the record and it's really ambitious as well. So you set the bar really really high and from here we go to Rhyme or Reason, and I love that beat and love the big samples and first time you reference Rick Rubin as a producer on the record. When did you first have the idea of working with Rick?

E: I've always been a fan of Rick's, and my manager Paul had been talking to him and Rick had expressed that he had interest in working with me. And when Paul brought it to my attention I was like super excited, honored at the fact that he was even thinking about it. I had my reservations just because I felt like I'm a super fan of Rick, and I'd probably be a little nervous and wouldn't know what the vibe would be because I would be wanting to impress him. It was very much the feeling that I got early on with Dre.

ZL: Had you met Rick before?

E: Nah, I'd never met him. So I was like nervous to meet him and you know, even more nervous to work with him.

ZL: Same thing with Dre, all the way back, same kind of experience when you walked in the studio and saw Dre that time..

E: Yeah I'm still always trying to impress Dre too to this day at the same time. But I just kept thinking if I got in the studio with Rick, what if we're not able to come up with anything. I had all these things in my head, and then when I met him, the guy's so laid back, it made it easy. And his vibe in the studio is very much like... "Try whatever", don't be afraid to try whatever, even if the idea in the beginning is stupid. Because a lot of ideas in the beginning stages, not mine of course, mine are just insane from the moment I think of them- but sometimes ideas are not always the greatest.

ZL: Don't be afraid to fail to get somewhere else, to get on the journey.

E: So if you say one thing that's going to spark another thing to lead to a better thought, that's kinda how it went. We started going through old break beats and I was trying to tell him I kinda had the idea, I kinda had a notion that I was going to call it the Marshall Mathers LP 2, but I didn't want to say anything yet to him because I wasn't 100 percent sure- and I wanted to make sure that I had enough songs to even play for him that would make sense. I love the sound that Rick gets when he does hip hop. Even from early on, Beastie Boys- it's incredible. And that's what I was kinda hoping to get.
How can I make the record sound nostalgic, but subliminally nostalgic. So it reminded you of maybe 13 years ago when you first heard me but its overs beats that are even older, but you're not sure why you feel this way. Tried to create a feel, so we started messing with old samples and break beats and things like that- cuz Rick is super talented and mastered of every other genre of music as well. The way he dips in and out of just different genres is crazy to me. Like I said, I was hoping to get what I got from him.

ZL: The first time I saw Berzerk as well, I was so happy to see the way that you came through, and the video the way the colors were so reverse Beastie Boy style- it was fan boy stuff for me. To be able to go out in a beanie like the Ad-Rock thing and it was cool, I love that.



[Snippet from "Brainless"]
"Who can say for sure? Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
Society will reap a great benefit."

[Zane Lowe]
Let's talk about your work on the record as a producer, because I know on Relapse you did nothing, on Recovery you got back into it, I've always said to you as long as I've know you or you've been making beats how much of a fan I am of your particular music, your production for others as well as just for yourself.

[Eminem]
Oh, thank you.

[Zane Lowe]
And so to hear you back making beats again on some of the standout beats on the record was a real thrill. So, I mean, how was that getting back into the producer's chair and deciding to wear two hats again?

[Eminem]
Urm, I mean that was fun, it was fun to, to be able to, just mess around with beats from scratch again and, you know, sometimes, like, I think Recovery was the first time that I ever got really super-open to, urr, working with a lot of other producers, you know that was the most I had ever done, and, you know, aside from working with Dre. You know, so, on that album kind of opened those doors a little bit, so that's kinda how early on, we started approaching this record, or this album, and sometimes, like I may get something in my head like an idea or the mood of something that I would want and I'm not always gonna get that by going through, you know, different tracks if other people have made, they don't know what's in my head, you know what I'm saying, so it's also a good way to, ur, I think maybe it helps with diversity a little bit too, with the sound and all that, you know, I would get something in my head and wanna be able to lay that idea down from scratch.

[Zane Lowe]
It just sounds like your being inspired by rap, in a big big way, I mean...

[Eminem]
Absolutely

[Zane Lowe]
I mean, I know you've always been that way, we've known each other for a long time and I've met you at various points throughout every album and I know that it's...

[Eminem]
I just met you, out there I thought... It's all good man, I'm still peeling the floors. (Laughter)

[Zane Lowe]
Um, you know and the music reflects your head space, it's always been pretty honest, not just lyrically but also musically I mean there was a time when the beats you were making were all very kind of minor key and lots of strings and lots of, kind of, a lot of Drama. The beats on here are fun. I mean, they're fat, big and rap! Like inspired by hip-hop!

[Eminem]
Yeah, I mean, it's pretty much all I do, and all I wanna do, you know what I'm saying like, so it's fun for me, like I'm still, you know, like I'm still passionate about hip-hop, and every aspect of it, so, making beats and producing, you know, is definitely, it's fun for me.

[Zane Lowe]
What is it about rap that you love? I mean I'm a huge, I mean I grew up on hip-hop and it forms pretty much every sort of thing I've ever done in my life pretty much to some form, and what I wondered, you know, being someone who is considered one of the greatest of all time, what is it about rap the art form, if you can even trace it back to when you first discovered it, to how you feel about it now and what are your most rap-heavy records?

[Eminem]
You know, just a lot of rap.

[Zane Lowe]
A lot of rapping on there, a lot of words?

[Eminem]
Yeah

[Zane Lowe]
What is it about it that you love, if you can put it into words?

[Eminem]
Hmm, I dunno, I, urm, I love the fact that you can, I love the expression of it. The fact that you can, you know, just, I don't know, I love the, I love beats and rhymes and I love the fact that you can express yourself in a rhyme and lay it down and it can be therapeutic, and you've got it off your chest, and then you could go on to the next thing, I don't know, there's so much shit that I love about rap, you know, I'm in it for like, I love to watch what's going on in the game and keep my finger on the pulse of that, you know, and it's exciting to watch as a fan, for me too, you know, just being a fan of hip-hop, urm, and watching as it, you know, the evolution of it, and, you know, how it moves from each year to year, you know what I'm saying, the direction, and...

[Zane Lowe]
Are you sort of relieved that you can be that now, you can be a contender for the world's greatest rapper along with a selection of your peers and it can be a really amazing rap record and to a certain extent, I hope you take this the right  way because I know your strong career, very popular, number 1 in 80+ countries, huge, but the pop stars kind of did, you know, in the sense of what people expect from you these days, isn't it, you don't have to be that guy any more, you can just be a rapper and make rap records if you want. Is that a relief?

[Eminem]
Well, yeah, I think so, urm, it's one of them things like, as far as like, being a pop star or whatever like, I never, never intended to be any of that, you know wha I'm saying, like, all I ever wanted to do was get respect from, you know, my peers       and other rappers, and, urm, all the other stuff that came with it was just, you know, confusing to me, it was, I don't know, like I don't feel like I ever set out to make a pop song or a song that was gonna be some kind of crossover song or whatever... is that for me?

[Zane Lowe]
Yeah, if you want it.

[Eminem]
Thanks man, appreciate it. Urm...

[Zane Lowe]
And then boom, you did! And it didn't stop for years!

[Eminem]
Well boom, it happened but at the same time, like - I never wanted to - when things did did keep happening and when certain things kept hitting the radio and things like that, I mean, I don't think I'm stupid. I'm not stupid. Like, I know when a song has a certain particular sound and sounds like "well maybe this could possibly be a radio record", or when I'm going "fuck, shit, ass!" you know what I'm saying, and I know "this will never go to radio". But at the same time, if a song starts heading that way, cause a lot of times I may even think, I may even think certain things when I'm writing it, like, maybe what person this might connect with, you know what I'm saying like, and who I might connect with with this song. But I never, in making any song I have made, I never wanted to compromise lyrical integrity, yeah, you know, and I always wanted to make sure that if I was rapping on a beat that had some kind of appeal to it and was catchy, that I was at least doing my job as an MC, and you know what I'm saying...

[Zane Lowe]
Oh that's the struggle!

[Eminem]
And doing what I feel like I need to do.

[Zane Lowe]
That's tough man, because you want to give as much quality as you possibly can through your music, you're not going to hold yourself back in case you get successful, but at the same time like you say it's never been on the agenda, and I guess in a way that was part of what caused the problem in the first place that just manifested over that time, huh, like, how do I do both? How do I be good and not court this, not be this guy that everybody expects something from?

[Eminem]
Yeah, urm, I know that early on I went through a lot of that with the "Hi, my name is" record, and it was, urm, like I never understood, like I understood that the record was funny, and i understood that it was a little, urm, how you say, kitschy, or whatever, and maybe the hook was, the whole record was tongue-in-cheek. You know what I'm saying, like I'm still doing a lot of records like that to this day, with the tongue-in-cheek, but that record in particular was just like, it was my, it was almost like my anti-pop song cause it was like my hello to the world but it was my "fuck you" to the world at the same time. So I never understood, like, when all that started happening, like holy shit how did that become a, you know, I guess pop song.

[Zane Lowe]
So when did the penny drop and you realized the more you say "fuck you", the more people are gonna say, you know, "hi, we love you"?

[Eminem]
Urm, I don't know, I mean...

[Zane Lowe]
Probably around the Marshall Mathers LP right, cause that's when it really started to, to blow up again?

[Eminem]
Yeah, I think, I think there was a lot of that, and I think that just, coming from being an underground MC and being an underdog and things like that kinda gave me that attitude I think, you know, I think that had a lot to do with it, and then, you know, watching NWA and other people, 2Pac, you know what I'm saying, like, it was like, he's not going to, him or they, aren't going to kiss your ass to make you like their music.

[Zane Lowe over snippet from "Survival"]
Yeah, that's exactly what they want to do, let things slide a bit, you know. Now, you kind of talk about that on this song here, on The Monster (plays snippet from "The Monster"), and I think this is the one where you really address it in the most eloquent way about like, it's the gift and the curse, you know, I'm aware of the trouble it can get you in, I've been through that, you know. Number 1 album, number 1 movie, number 1 this number 1 that, not really in a position to really, kind of, really, be able to absorb that, yet, it's intoxicating, isn't it?

[Eminem]
Yeah, it was like, it was this thing, where, and I'm not gonna lie, I still wish it today, that it was like this thing where I want this attention for this music, but then I wanna be able to go in public, and I wanna be able to eat a fucking sandwich, you know what I mean, and be left alone. So, it was like "man, if I could...", because, I'd never been an attention seeker, and it seems like a hell of a career choice, you know, but, I don't like attention, that's not just why I do it, just to get attention, I don't like to be in public and walk around and be, like, here I am, you know what I mean, like, it's not what I want, I just wanted, my dream was, my dream was for like, fuck man, to be able to one day, like hear rappers that I look up to on the radio, like "yo, what if Jay Z, whoever, what if they heard of me, what if they thought I was dope? You know what I'm saying like? That was where my mentality always was, was with it. So when it all went crazy it was really hard to wrap my head around, you know, a lot of it still is, but especially back then.

[Zane Lowe]
Yeah. You know, you have done something which very few people have done now, you've actually been at the center of the world, the center of that storm, and you've emerged out of it, you popped out of the other side of it, I mean. Elvis didn't do that, you know, Michael Jackson didn't do that, Whitney Houston... a lot of people who have been in the public eye to that extent, unfortunately the list of various reasons, I'm sure personal to them, is too long, who didn't make it through. You have, and what does the world look like to you, when you've come out the other side of that, and you're 5 years sober and you're looking on that chaos for some perspective?

[Eminem]
Urm, I don't know, I mean I'm definitely thankful, you know what I mean, I know that could have certainly took another path...

[Zane Lowe]
And gone that way, yeah.

[Eminem]
Yeah, I could have went another direction but, I don't know, I mean, I think that, I feel like, like I'm probably able to see it, I'm able to be more focused now than I've ever been, urm, but I'm also able to I guess put it in perspective. The problem is I can't put a lot of perspective because I don't, there's a lot that's, you know, gone, there's a lot that I don't remember, and maybe that's cool, too, you know what I'm saying, where...

[Zane Lowe]
Probably a good thing?

[Eminem]
Yeah but, I don't know man, I know, I know that, there's so many addicts in this world, you know, and people who have problems like that, that don't make it, you know what I'm saying so I, I'm thankful for that, but urr, you know, I think that's one thing that really helps me, urr, through, and just, keeps me pushing forward is the music, is the passion for that and, and, and, you know.



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Here I go, lyrical
I have no Idea what I'm doin' but I'm spiritual
On the microphone I tear you up in stereo
I'm like the grand wizard, yes, I'm the imperial
I have no fuckin' clue what the fuck I'm doin'
But "Freifick, Muschi", your whole life is ruined
If you try to step to me your life's in jeopardy
'Cause I will seek you out wit'

[Speaking: Stefan Raab to Eminem]
"Now it's my part!"

[Hook: Stefan Raab]
Zucker im Kaffee
Und Zitrone oder Sahne in den Tee
Und dazu den ganzen Tag lang nur Amor
Das ist wunderbar, Seor

[Speaking: Stefan Raab to Eminem]
"And now it's your part again, it's your part again, it's your part again!"

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yes, here we go  break it down
I got the crown, I'm 'bout to take it now
Yo, I got my man and he's on the guitar
And when it comes to lyrics I go so far
Like a car that I'm drivin', survivin' of Vivarin
I'm alive, I'm like eye of the tiger
And I kick it so, so, fuckin' hard
Now "Freifick, Muschi", don't diss me  regard it, come on!

[Speaking: Stefan Raab to Eminem]
"And now it's my part again, here we go!"

[Hook: Stefan Raab]
Zucker im Kaffee

Nochmal!
Zucker, Zucker, Zucker, Zucker ...
Zucker im Kaffee
Und Zitrone oder Sahne in den Tee, aha!
Und dazu den ganzen Tag lang nur Amor
Das ist wunderbar, Seor

[Outro: Stefan Raab]
Give me some noise! Make some noise!



[Verse 1: Nas]

What up?
Escobar season begins
Repent your sins
Nine-Six
Trackmasters

Spark the lye with the eight-forty I fly
Pretty thug show no love its like when doves cry
Maybe I'm just too demanding, parked the Land
Mark Buchanan, fuck a job I'mma die scramblin
Digger gold, dig a bigger hole in ya soul
Que Pasa, Pablo's throne cabron
At the airport the Mobb picked me up in a truck
Jewelry chunky like fuck never scared to get stuck
So whats the deal Papi?
Heard the feds could of knocked me
Had the cuban posse all up in my room and lobby
Negotiating, my name holds weight, we motivatin'
Hustling, as if God was dancing with Satan
The Firm waitin', to get ajourned cause we facing
Double life, thuggin for life, you taste it
The white numbin ya toungue
I bought it from Dominicans
A suitcase of benjamins swung tight in his fingers
Had the Firm gun slingers, hit the lights, grab the white
Murder everything in site, and jet in the Bimmers
Now im home with the phone screaner
Resting the stones in a jewelry cleaner
Checkin my mail reading my supoena
To the witness standing, I got remanded
Livin on the 4th building and can't stand it
Gotta fight my case from the inside
Niggas telling, I felt it coming when my pockets started swelling
But thats the game for ya
Hid a stash to ya lawyers
Supreme court, Queens New York will bore ya'
Suited up, booted up, with the jail cut
Million dollar bail what?
Z put up the house and I was out
Word the Fuck Up
Time to get the shit on son
Tryna trap a nigga
Incarcerate me yo'
Check it tho, yo, yo

Im gonna make it if I try, cross my heart hope to die
(cross my heart hope to die)
Im gonna make it if I try, cross my heart hope to die

Praise the Lord, ive been scarred with hot water
Days are shorter, next court dates around the corner
Money ain't the same, shit is outta order
Since the days of Rich Porter
Something gotta give, I ain't trying to bid
Now I run up in cribs, body shit, but no women no kids
In the Bridge where the murderers live
I used to make a quarter million monthly
I was ill until they sunk me
Killed the snitch with the pump 3 shots
Bought a passport off a junkie
The Firm helped me flee out the country
Word and I'm out, Pakastinian land
Chilling with my man Jungle
The commissioner Stout
Killa B, what it is nigga firm biz

[Intro]
Yeah, hahaha
"When I flow for the street.." - ".. who else could it be"
"Nas.."

[Verse 1]
Yo, explode, my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers
Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap
As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube
Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube
Was a, long time ago, John Boy Ice
Geronimo po-lice jumpin' out Chryslers, e-z wider paper
Pops puffin' his cess, punchin' his chest like a gorilla
Outside was psychoes, killers
Saw Divine, Goon, and Chongo, Lil' Turkey
R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursin front of Ms. Vercey
Big Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters
My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean
I knew, all that I'd seen had meant somethin'
Learned early, to fear none little Nas was huntin'
Livin carefree laughin', got jokes on the daily
Y'all actin' like some old folks y'all don't hear me
Yo, I'm in my second childhood

[Chorus: scratches by DJ Premier]
"When I flow for the street.." - ".. who else could it be"
"N-A-S" - "Nas.."
"Resurrect, through the birth of my seed.." - "Queensbridge"
"Make everything right.." - "Get yours, nigga"
"When I flow for the street.." - ".. who else could it be"
"N-A-S" - "Nas.."
"Resurrect, through the birth of my seed.." - "Queensbridge"
"Make everything right.." - "Get yours..."

[Verse 2]
Yo, dude is 31, livin' in his moms crib
Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid
Cornrows in his hair, still slingin', got a crew
They break his moms furniture, watchin' Comicview
Got babies by different ladies high smokin' L's
In the same spot he stood since eighty-five, well
When his stash slow, he be crazy
Say he by his moms, hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years
Sittin' on, different benches like it's musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night
With young dudes it's them he wanna be like
It's sad but it's fun to him, right? He never grew up
31 and can't give his youth up, he's in his second childhood

[Chorus: scratches by DJ Premier]
"When I flow for the street.." - ".. who else could it be"
"N-A-S" - "Nas.."
"Resurrect, through the birth of my seed.." - "Queensbridge"
"Make everything right.." - "Get yours, nigga"
"When I flow for the street.." - ".. who else could it be"
"N-A-S" - "Nas.."
"Resurrect, through the birth of my seed.." - "Queensbridge"
"Make everything right.." - "Get yours..."

[Verse 3]
Baby girl she's always talkin', name droppin', hangin' late
Drinkin', smokin', hates her baby daddy, craves shoppin'
E poppin' Ecstasy takin', won't finish her education
Best friend she keeps changin', stuck with limitations
Lustin' men, many hotels, Fendi, Chanel
With nothin' in her bank account frontin' she do well
Her kid suffers he don't get that love he deserve
He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse
No job never stay workin', mad purty
Shorty they call her the brain surgeon
Time flyin', she the same person
Never matures, all her friends married doin' well
She's in the streets yakkety yakkin' like she was 12
Honey is twenty-seven, argues fights
Selfish in her own right for life
Guess she's in her second childhood

[Chorus: scratches by DJ Premier]
"When I flow for the street.." - ".. who else could it be"
"N-A-S" - "Nas.."
"Resurrect, through the birth of my seed.." - "Queensbridge"
"Make everything right.." - "Get yours, nigga"
"When I flow for the street.." - ".. who else could it be"
"N-A-S" - "Nas.."
"Resurrect, through the birth of my seed.." - "Queensbridge"
"Make everything right.." - "Get yours..."

[Outro]
"Who else could it be.." - "N-A-S" - "Nas, Nas.."



Yo, this is Nas, the rebel to America
I load the clips 'til my lips are crass, cracked
Like a vet buggin' out from flashbacks
My raps, I shoot at your skull and leave ya sprung
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns
Paragraph wizard makin' mics malfunction
I blow the fuse with the style I choose
Science is dropped, my raps are toxic
My voice-box locks and excels like a rocket
Nas assassinates the Pope with a scope
I mutilate mics 'til my voice-box is broke
Try to battle me and gasp for breath
Words I speak is a step beyond death
A rappin' Charles Manson, I'm just that odd
I'm so strong, long enough to box with God
I throw a pitch at your brain so try and catch it
My thought are bugged
My brains should be put in a straitjacket
I'm nastier than cannibalism
I'm as sharp as a shank in prison, thoughts abrupt, risen
My rap is a ritual of Satan
Though I'm not demonic, my voice is electronic
My brain is deranged
In a metamorphic change, my sound waves are strange
Many say that I'm propelled to Hell
But I met the Devil and wrecked his brain cell
Police murderer, I love to kill a black cop
Nasty Nas is as deadly as a crack spot
And smoke a mic like a fiend
I use a TEC 9 like I was ???????
I go on till the break of dawn
Breakin' raps in half, my word is bond
It's like that and, uh, I go on and on
Akinyele, rock the mic till the mic is torn



Coming soon...

It be the firm biz getting it off
Slow regez the elegant black prince
We take the top gator
Black and shrotopass like im a raider
Sophistacater
Hang tight like dre right
Flow like hawian in the broad day light
I give all that I have
All in my power to see the day
That the crowd weighted
You expired and outdated
Re segregated
None of my people graduated
Ain't no progress in the projects
It's the same process
Rise to the top of New York
Keep the digest
Through all my cornets
Global solar
It's young omar
The shuffuler
We analyze who they really are
Familiar, blow holes into your interior
You minute, little man
You think you general?

[Nature]

I put the hinds betters
Fake thugs styles glued together
Saying old rhymes show signs
You're through whatever
Eat your heart out
I play my part now
Fiend to be part of the squad
But I'm not gonna be shot down
Who's how now? I'm disgusted at you
Rap doo doo
It's funny if you let these cats fool you
The whole no wait
Your values dying at a slow rate
Opposition track live niggas pop gats
Been doin' this since the days of hot tracks
Claimin' you in the firm how's that?
When you got your spot jacked
Read between the lines
The foulest dreams was lead to blind
Tonight is excellence redefined
In the form of Nature, Noreaga
Nas, Mary J. Blige
Femme Fetale on the rise
Manager extraordinaire
My man, Jungle
Pussy rebundled like desert plans
Spitting vivid raps
My whole clique rocking fitted hats
Millionaire status play the block give it back
Thanks to who?
My pen names tight like langston hughes
Generating chips, picking which banks to choose
Clever robberies, on deposits
I got this, why niggas on the blocks
Stare at bitches gossip
I pop shit so understand me
From day one I rap whole new guns
That run in the family

[Noreaga]
Wa dada dang wa da da dang Hey Listen to my mac milli just go bang
Wa dada dang wa da da dang this is the firm biz



[Cormega](Nas)

Yo check this out on the real son

Son you gonna set it? set it son
Matter of fact though

[Nas]

I peep you frontin, I was in the Jeep
Sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin bout how you ran the Island in eighty-nine
Layin up, playin the yard with crazy shine
I cocked a baby 9 that nigga grave be mine, clanked him
What was he thinkin on my corner when it's pay me time
Dug em you owe me cousin somethin told me plug him
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped son
Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin me my name, what the ugh
I got stitched up and went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped
Black was in the Jeep watchin all these scenes speed by
It was a brown Datsun, and yo nobody in my hood got one
That clown cat's through, blazin at his crew

I can't believe it achieve
Yo Cormega whatever whatever whatever

[Cormega]
Pushin' a red lex
With many screams inside the headsets
So much beef, police surprised I ain't dead yet
I keep red tech in the passenger seat
To match their heat
It's so real if I don't see you I'm splashing your beep
It's on the kid
Whoever gets his first
It's going to kids dirt
My soldiers be cold blooded vultures
And cold blooded
Yo on the street we control hundreds
I drink polatas so all my people roll blunted
Your man froze when I rolled up
I symbolize death like a cobra
Attacks your life here it's over
Black you effed up
Never should've messed up
My black cocksucker scared to die tough luck
You know my steelo im like Al Pacino
Yo Nas Escobar grab the mic and flex a bar

[Nas]
I'm in the black limo
Jack Daniel through the crack window
I spot the fake red dot his face like a Hindu
Grab the symbol
Show examples to make examples
Essential amounts you owe to the fam crew
Firm affiliation paper chasing
Chip glossy rich pablo es cubano
Sophisticano
Yo blazing halos like shadow
Yo nigga im the castro
Im coming through on your wack crew
What you gonna do
Cormega pick the mic come through

[Cormega]

Ay yo I get mines
Well enough to be considered big time
My crew a chosen few legit minds
Who live prime
Shorty's on some fly stuff
Admitted that can't resist mines
Mahogany complexion
Body probably dressed in
My ill tommy hill collection
When I be flexin', sketch it
My selection of words are type effective
When I rhyme words are verbalized remain present
In mines, I'm like an with air macs nikes on
Recite nice on mics strike like a python
My gold chain with ice on lookin' trife on
My Jacuzzi filled with tight warm relaxed lookin steaming
Lounging like a falcon on a mountain top at Egypt
Cats schemin when they see my rocks gleaming
Mega shine forever rhyme wicked like a demon
Where my charcoal, new balance a lot yo
The narcs go knocked my man Marco
His money was marked yo
I regulate a sharp flow
But in my life bucaso
My mom died when I was five and never left my heart yo
I symbolize rive alive niggas
Ghetto's where I live
Considered my rhyme the oasis
Because rap was a desert
And I helped minds escaped it
Yo Nas link it up it's like an ill typed bracelet

[Nas]

Fake thug, no love
You get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low
I didn't know til I was drunk though
You freak cats get played out
Get robbed and laid out
Prostitute turned snitch
I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jumped out the Range
Empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'ze make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, thirty-two shots
Ya'll niggas don't want none of this

[Cormega]

Ayo check it my man Joe Shan is downstairs
My man Georgie is lounging downstairs
My man Big Ice he lounging in Queensbridge
And all you real cats know what time it is
On the real all you crabs cats know the deal
On the real all you crabs cats know the deal
On the real all you crabs cats know the deal
Now check the new verse
Check the new verse it's ill
Yo my millennium got people mind prisoner
Pain digital wood brain material
Rims spin sinister
Grin like John Dillinger
Iced out medallions my style will keep killin' ya
Misery and jealousy when you envision me
I'm getting mines and still livin' on the strength of me
You never bust nothin' or got ill touched nothin'
My baby face ice grill I heard something for real
In any cipher i'll serve em like a viper
I go for mines like I go for time on Rikers
Steelo like pacino benzino benz bilo we know
People we dope like mafiaso like gambino
Where Sergio Tacchinio took a jab in a casino
I like sony cause they saw my man keeno
Can't forget my home girl Faith Newman
She be boomin'
My people they representing
Every percent in
In my firm team
We so ill our people burn cream

Life is real a lot of trife things be happening
I love yall kids I love my whole mobb deep fam
It's real like that you know life has tied me man
Yo I lived the life of 62 pick ups
Pumping on corners beat downs and stick ups
Seeing events in which you have to stay silent
Murder extortion and all types of violence
Yo kids living a life ghetto heaven
Selling cracks getting ready to attack with nines and mac elevens
You know my style
You can't stop what knocks me down
Peace to AZ, Nas, and figure Foxy Brown
My whole firm team is ill no doubt
I can't forget the commissioner he's called Steve Stoute
With the ill benz
He rocks the ill dimes and ill rims
You know my steelo
I'm like Al Pacino
God bless the life of my man nino

[Nas]

It's sort of like the conclusion to "Color Purple"
Brothas is losing, confusion, with one time all pursuit moves in
Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit
Cop verses the block, shorties is too quick
Lesson number one. If you're arrested and hung
Where Brothas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue
It's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer
The violent words of a prince in a palace of Persia
The cognac plurger plus the trees
But whose the faul one to make his nose take a freeze
And got enough gold to rock ice in all hype
Used to be a general but just lost his stripe
Pipe dreams and white feinds and all-nighters, collect calls from lifers
Astoria walls with cypress, but yo that's another subject
I love teks let's get it off
Yo what up what up

[Cormega]

Yo funkmaster flex you know I got the ill lex
I wear my guests in apendix
And cash my cheque in flesh shit
My man escobar be lighting a weed
And I proceed with all the ill types of rhymes you need
I'm not the new jack, or crew rack I'm like the next man
Cormega, I just got signed to Def Jam
My man Nas is down with me
A lot of sucker rappers they can't diss me
It's like that, you know it's like that
We'll strike back Queensbridge style
My mobb deep people is mad foul
A juvenile delinquent wet your prequit
I get my money numerous occasions
It's frequent my man Ike
Tried to avalanche ice watch
You know my steelo Al Pacino
Yo Escobar

[Nas/Cormega]
Escobar season
Cormega 4 reason
We with it what
I'll stay high triple beamin
Queensbridge

[Verse 1: Nas]
You cocked back
You thought you had it planned, you thought you had your man
He saw you coming, he ran when you tried to blast that man
You missed him by inches, he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of 'em pull through but one didn't, son's finished
You took the life of him
The part about it that's crazy, you was aight with him
Tight with him, why was he in the way?
Why was he standing next to the enemy that specific day?
His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive
Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days
They never had no probs
Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage
These two different personalities had to collide
Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died
You ask why, 'cause of a

[Chorus: Nas]
Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of 'em, read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
We grew up doing graffiti, now hollow heads getting heated
Seated in foreign cars, constantly getting weeded
Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars
But fuck em all, we balling 'til they come lock us up
20 to life; I'm clubbing, blowing 20 tonight
We the mob, Bob Marley Marlin' all through the night
Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war
Snatch a TEC off the shelf, live forever; that's Insh'Allah
Memoirs of a rich nigga
Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers
New Benz, chrome rims are for show, killer
You niggas accidental, shoppers in back of the limo
Pay your tithes, stay alive, can't be dodging my clique
Cut a check; I use your bitch for some bargaining chips
In a hole, sell your home, nigga go sell your soul
This forty-five in control, God forgives and I don't

[Chorus: Nas]
Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin

Accident murderer
Accident murderer, you just an accident murderer

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, for my nigga that got killed, got hit up
Vodka spills on the concrete, light a swisha, we miss ya
And for that girl who never made it home, shot in the dome
How they gon' kill that beautiful sister?
Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons
Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I'm guessing
Tell me who you impressing
Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them
Make em throw up they hands, choke 'em out playing wrestling
Watch em grow to a man, I see them now they repping
But they cold-blooded, homie, wondering where the respect went
Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas
Can't hang with these little niggas, they're killing, they're reckless
Wish I could build with him, but will he change really?
Some real killers, I think of Wayne Perry
Think of my nigga Drawz, but you aren't a name to me
You ain't mean to kill him, it wasn't necessary

[Chorus: Nas]
Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin

[Verse 4: Ryan Leslie]
Born on June 4th - the mind of a Gemini
Plight of a societal OutKast - Aquemeni
You bought a hammer just to silence the clamour
For another real G on the block, after your man got popped
When shots rang out, you ran for cover
Bought your first gun, spent a couple grand for another four
Told your mom you was preparing for war
She signed the shape of the cross each time you ran out the door
But you ain't never had the mind of a killer
You was more of an actor - with the movement of a small time dealer
When the feds came they got you for light work
Facing a few years, defence attorney told you it might work
To cop a plea and turn informant - you could save a few tenants
And at the same time reduce your sentence
You wore a wire to the home of your old supplier
And when they raided, you ain't make it - you was caught in the fire
Of an accident murderer

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Nas]
The ghetto Othello, the Moor
Oh my God, they speak venomous on the boy
Oh my Lord, my enemy is fear, and I'm sure
Oh my God, they want the end of me 'cause I'm pure
Oh my Lord, discipline for the win, I just go for it
It's a trend for these men to die on their own sword
Journey far, learn who you can be
But you can learn who you are when you around family
Chip off the shoulders of soldiers, on they grizzle
My granddaddy Mack Little married Nannie Little
They passed down wisdom, blessings were given
Pray my sins don't get passed to my children
I made a killin', I'm alive like the morning star
Court Jordan's for the price on stock, so what the Hornets are?
I need evaluations, I'm savvy, y'all
Eatin' foie gras and caviar, listen

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree

[Verse 2: Nas]
The ghosts of gangsters dance
Chinchillas shake on the hanger, the force of this banger
Yeah, my language advanced, my cadence amazin'
The voice triggers somethin', what is this conundrum?
The clouds scurry, your spirit rumble, a boyish smile
Still puff the loud, it's nothin' less than a quarter pound
Savage narrative, every verse that I write bursts light
Brings awareness to my personal life
After my morning walk, Havana cigar, the ganja spark
See my doctor more, sweat in the sauna or the spa
Spendin' fifty large at the Bellagio
Spent twenty on a bad bitch I hardly know
New girl every night, two girls was every other night
Sexual addiction, gangster tradition
They wanna fuck me, have me under they belt, slightly offended
Yeah, that's how I felt, that's how it ended
I'm just good at existin', existin' in my truth
As long as I enjoy the fruit, yeah

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree

[Verse 3: Nas]
What come first, peace or the paper?
Before I had a piece of paper, peace was in my favor
Before I sat to eat at the table, it had leeches and traitors
Cut the fat from the meat, extract the weak, bon appetit
No bacon, brothers is swine
It's so hard to trust 'em 'cause my hustle is mine
It's evident they all the same, with gray hair and still mean muggin'
Gray hairs of wisdom, that means you seen somethin'
Say somethin', you stay frontin'
But these clowns got false crowns, fictitional kings
You broke my heart, Fredo
You bring this thing of ours down to a fable
Be advised my guys dyin', enterprisin' at a boss's table
There's always room at my table
Insecurities is keepin' you disabled
All this money to get, is there less time?
They ain't stopped printin' money, 'cause they made mine
I learned to stretch time, these are the best times
I'm in my neighborhood in stadiums, the Mets' kind
With restaurants and Carbone, spicy rigatoni
Go hard, a red Bordeaux, oh God

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree

R-A-W
R-A-W

[Post-Chorus: Nas]
Fuck outta here, second guessin' our love
Dick Tracy, detective, inspectin' hoes need a hug
You need to detect this dick, get your ass out the club
Get a cookbook, you gossipin', watchin' hip-hop & love, uh

[Verse 1: Nas]
I don't mean to be brass, even a genius asks questions in class
Supposed to know a love that'll last
Her friends, they don't mess with rappers, correction
I'm Akhenaten, King Tut's predecessor
I fantasize, and no mind him, I'm slick with words
Tell your girlfriend I flip the birds
She don't know shit, I am your neighbor
Brother, homie, love, a friend to smoke with
I want us to take road trips, fuck that low shit
I'm on some more 'everybody-should-know' shit
Or let's be real discreet
Everybody lies, not everybody Nas
So your friend might hate (Ayy)
When was the last time her and a man was straight? (Ayy)
Just chill, light bulbs dim (Ayy)
You are my adult film

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz and Nas]
Life begins right now
Life begins right now (My adult film)
Life begins right now (My adult film)
Life begins right now (R-A-W)
No matter what they say (You are, you are, my adult film)
Life begins right now (You my, you my, R-A-W)

Fuck outta here, second guessin' our love (Hey)

[Bridge: Nas]
The end of your comfort zone is the start of your life
The end of your comfort zone is the start of your life
You start to get comfortable after you get it right
Yeah, you start to get comfortable after you get it right

[Verse 2: Nas]
Misogynistic monologue what we dialogue
Yeah, I'm mature from the chest, and higher North
But below the waist, I'm a dog
Your girl in heat like cayenne sauce
She so sweet, but she kinda lost
Like me, African name with a diamond cross
But you a strong, stand-tall soldier
They lean on you, expecting you not to fall over
Like you never feel pressure, like you made of steel
So I absorb your pain, I like to see you chill
Eight millimeter cinematic celluloid
I see us both, little girl, little boy
Explorin' the world, similar, virgins became experienced
We both like it in front of mirrors, and this shit start weighin' on me
Feel your good vibes layin' on me
When them light bulbs dim
Lemme watch you, my adult film

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz and Nas]
Life begins right now
Life begins right now (My adult film)
Life begins right now (My adult film)
Life begins right now (R-A-W)
No matter what they say (You are, you are, my adult film)
Life begins right now (You my, you my, R-A-W)
Life begins right now
Life begins right now

[Post-Chorus: Nas and Swizz Beatz]
Fuck outta here second guessin' our love (Hey)
Dick Tracy, detective, inspectin' hoes need a hug
You need to detect this dick, get your ass out the club (Hey)
Then pick a good book, so we can both get our knowledge up, uh-huh

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Life begins right now
Life begins right now
Life begins right now
Life begins right now
No matter what they say
Life begins right now
Life begins right now
Life begins right now
Hey
Hey

[Intro: AZ]
This is what, this what they want, huh?
This is what it's all about?
Time to take Affirmative Action, son
They just don't understand, you kna'mean?
Niggas comin' sideways, thinkin' stuff is sweet, man
Niggas don't understand the four devils
Lust, envy, hate, jealousywicked niggas, man

[Verse 1: AZ]
Yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact
Sip your con-gi-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundromat
Sneak attack, the new cats in rap worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate? We play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch 'em and break
Undress 'em, tie 'em with tape, no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone
Or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get thrown
Aristocrats, politickin' daily with diplomats
See me, I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

[Verse 2: Cormega]
Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche
My destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a ki of heroin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
In Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina, they will see ya when you re-up
Bring your heater, all your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got an ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a fed team
Corleone be turnin' niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus
'Mega the pretty boy with mafia connections
It's The Firm, nigga, set it

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, my mind is seein' through your design like Blind Fury
I shine jewelry, sippin' on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickenin', he just finished biddin' upstate
And now the projects is talkin' that somebody-gotta-die shit
It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch, but God forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice, so Hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars, meetin' Foxy at Demars, movin' cars
Your top papi Seor Escobar

[Verse 4: Foxy Brown]
In the black Camaro, Firm deep
All my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Mot Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shittin' hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters, Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm, baby, from BK to the Bridge, my nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is?
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin' Cristy
Sittin' on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The gods, they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal
And Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak, that's pure though
Flippin' the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
He had a fuckin' villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama, but wait, it's half-and-half
Ki's is one and two-fifth, so how we flip?
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16
Double it times three, we got 48
Which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four
Subtract it by eight, we back to 16
Now add the other two that 'Mega bringin' through
So let's see, if we flip this other ki
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki

[Outro: Foxy Brown]
The Firm, baby, Vol. 1



[Verse 1: Foxy Brown]
Check it, uhh
Protect this, nigga, for the necklace, I throw the death wish
The pretty slim sex shit to rep this
Remember Fox said this, we on some next shit
We are blessed this, the scars on our back mean we meant this
To lie for 'em, the 25-sentence to keep my eyes on 'em
I'm straight, knowin' Allah'll shine on 'em
Shitty drugs and drama, opposite 3 pretty thugs and a don mama
Fill in the rest, the steel in they chest
When Boogs threw the kiss of death, it was over and we laid out
Chill, I was open off the way he ate out
It was real, for real, I was fuckin' with mills and he was frag-ile
You wildin', the Brown Stallion stay stylin'
On the low foulin', the whole Firm wildin'
We lucked it, I know the trick bitch he fuck with
On some duct shit, heard through the grape that she suck dick
Firm, Sos and Esco, mad loco, Fox and 'Mega for whatever
And through this cheddar, we gon' stay family 'til we fry, though
The fam will never split even if one of us got old
Along with our Kikos, we gon' blaze 'til the brick goes
Peep the Na-Na, sweet taboo, The Firm tattooed on the ta-ta
Now, tell me what crew will hold it down like we do, Da-Da?

[Verse 2: AZ]
'Til the death of this, murderous moves pursue effortless
Ice necklace, high-priced dressed executives
Peep the grammar, slim built, strong stamina
.44 nickel-plate long with the silencer
Play for keeps, any shut-eye, you stay sleep
Shit remain deep, get shells thrown at ya Range Jeep
Giuliani sweep got all the kings goin' up creek
Devil life biz, now, who left controllin' the streets?
No intelligence, strictly slow niggas mind's are negligent
It's evident, Feds vest-up, raid ya residence
We're all for livin', heavyweight Firm division
Mind detect mind, eatin' swine's against my religion
You know the steez, take aim, cock and squeeze
It's the prophecies, not the philosophies of Socrates
Next up? (Yo, I believe that's me)
Aiyo 'Mega, represent for the family

[Verse 3: Cormega]
Aiyo, the Feds got me in the top ten
'Cause when my door got knocked in, my .44 main cocked spit
My sinister mind shines like a Dillinger
'Mega exhausted, baby-faced crime emperor
Yo, life is based on cultures and creeds
And peep the way drugs feed a thug nigga's seeds
I've seen niggas lined up, handcuffed and tied-up
Coke prices rise when drug supplies dry-up
The Millennium drives up, rims semi blind ya eyes temporarily
Mind of 'Mega be heavily armed for felonies
Shine you could never see, the next phat cat out of NYC
It Was Written like ghetto life hieroglyphics
Livin' since my real niggas bailed me out of prison
A lot of schemes 'cause the narcotics team in Queens
Have more dollars then the knowledge of fiends
My dream is the legacy of Montana treasury
Fake thugs couldn't even take slugs or bury me

[Verse 4: Nas]
To all thoroughbreds takin' the corners, y'all need to join us
Firm, most powerful nation of rap performers
High-class generals, confidants, payin' lawyers
Swift as Oscar De La Hoya, Green Beret warriors
Fakes, I peep 'em like the J. Kennedy tape
In the nude with Jude, bustin' all in her face
In other words, yo, you see-through
My man built the Sugar Hill from a sweet tooth
We all eat 'cause I speak truth
Uneducated black youth, street diploma
Teach Greeks and Romans but the legacy was stolen
It's a Firm thing, generally gleam
I wrote the theme on how to sell a million
While you crabs is mad at ya promotion team
I roll with the nicest, Fox, black Isis pushin' Benz without a license
Gear tight as vice-grips
Nas got 19 wifies, 7 sheisty, 9 of 'em Pisces
3 white meats under Tai Chi
Wildin', big links is heavy like bricks
That you throw on a pit-bull neck while feedin' him raw steak
It's core take, more cake, I take the crown
Off the so-called king of the town and lock it down

[Outro: Jungle]
Yeah, dun, that's it, dun, y'all niggas rip that shit, yo, word is bond
That's that real shit for all y'all fake motherfuckers out there, yo
That's how we do it from Queensbridge, nigga, The Firm, what!
This is Jungle, yo, big Jungle, boy, what!? Y'all niggas don't want it
Yo, Style, if these niggas don't know right now, yo
Fuck all them niggas then

1996!
Back up in this nigga
The right way, though, you know?
(Double-tre son, you know ain't nothin' coincidental or accidental, dunn)
No doubt!
(You know how it's goin' down, man)
It was all written
(No question, I'm sayin' man, I mean, how we playin' man
You know what I'm sayin', they dealt us in, son
They playin' with a 54 deck, you see with the jokers in and everything, you know what I'm saying?)
Son, I'm playin' with the 52
(You wanna stress on how I used to play, that's how I playin')
But, yo, they takin' us into this next millennium, right now
(I'm sayin' law, you know what I'm sayin' we gotta lay the law
Cause without law ain't no order, you know what I'm sayin'
That's why these cats are slippin' through, you know what I'm sayin? They got the rules missin' though)
True
(Yo, word up, though, you know what I mean?)
Son, these niggas look faker than the new hundred dollars, son

Word, with the big ass face on it

You know what I'm sayin?)

[Intro: Nas & (Flo Simpson)]
Yo, it's like waking up, from a bad dream (America)
Just to figure out, you wasn't dreaming in the first place (no)

[Verse 1: Nas]
If all I saw was gangsters coming up as a youngster
Pussy and money the only language I clung to
Claim to, I mold myself up to become one
Ain't ya happy I chose rap? I'm a monster
Streets deceiving, can't believe my achievements
Cultural strata, persona's that of a non-needer
Cause I don't need nada 'cept for Prada beaver
For cold winters, tattoos got my summer sleeveless
To my G's on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums I come up, a phoenix caked up
Trying to take what I'm eating came up
A dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this
Savvy, mild, wild hardly
A man's man, who would've knew the beach houses and wild parties
Jezebels and Stella McCartneys
For years, all that, how can I not be dead?
This old German said I was a thug with a knotty head
Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled
With a face like he wonder where I got my bread
Probably all these stones he see, from my shows overseas
From crime to rhyme
My story is I'm from the home of the thieves

[Chorus: Nas, (Flo Simpson) & Both]
America (Americaaaaaa), pay attention
Wake up (Americaaaaaa), this is not what you think it is
America (Americaaaaaa), pay attention
This is not what you think it is

[Verse 2: Nas]
Blessed, the Lord is a G, he gotta be
Who's the God of suckers and snitches? The economy
Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe blew a death kiss to Fidel Castro
He'd want me to spit this
Only the strong survive, Nas bear witness
The hypocrisy is all I can see
White cop acquitted for murder, black cop, cop a plea
That type of shit make me stop and think
We in chronic need of a second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers athletes and actors
But not enough niggas in NASA
Who give you the latest dances, trends and fashion?
But when it comes to residuals, they look past us
Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us
Even in white tees, blue jeans and red bandanas

[Chorus: Nas, (Flo Simpson) & Both]
America (Americaaaaaa), pay attention
Wake up (Americaaaaaa), this is not what you think it is
America (Americaaaaaa), pay attention
This is not what you think it is
America (America, Americaaaaaa
This is not what you think it is)

[Verse 3: Nas]
Assassinations, diplomatic relations
Killed indigenous people built a new nation
Involuntary labor, took a knife split a woman naval
Took her premature baby, let her man see you rape her
If I could travel to the 1700s
I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite through your covenant
Love to sit on the Senate, and tell the whole government
Y'all don't treat women fair, she read about herself in the Bible
Believing she the reason sin is here
You played her, with an apron like, "Bring me my dinner dear"
She the 'nigga' here, ain't we in the free world?
Death penalty in Texas kill young boys and girls
Barbarity, I'm in the double-R casually
Bugging how I made it out the hood, dazzle me
How far are we really from third world savagery?
When the empire fall, imagine how crazy that'll be

[Chorus: Nas & (Flo Simpson)]
America (Americaaaaaa, Americaaaaaa)
America (Americaaaaaa
This is not what you think it is)
America (Americaaaaaa, ohh
This is not what you think it is)

[Outro: Nas]

Newscaster: "Recently there has been an emergence of socially
Conscious and political rappers. It seems to be
A new trend in the Hip-Hop world."

[Vers 1: Nas]
Spot build-rocker, lil' papa killed Hoffa
Beard little longer, feel strong and I'll stop ya
Drill sergeant, still thorough wheelbarrows of distilled vodka
Get me real bonkers like Will Ferrell on cat tranquilizer
Rap guys get bank and think they messiahs, but they liars
Vote fo who now? You're red, white and blue?
I'm American too, but I ain't with the president's crew
What you peddlin' and who you peddlin' to?
You ain't got the ghetto with you
Try'na lead my sheep to the slaughterhouse
Talkin 'bout +Rap the Vote+, you ain't thought about
The black vote mean nathan, who you gonna elect
Satan or Satan? In the hood nothin is changin, uh
We ain't got no choices who to choose
Ten-years ago they were tryin to stop our voices
And end Hip-Hop, they some hypocrites
Condoleeza Rice, I don't really get this chick
Tell her if she ever really cared about poor schools
About poor children, then she gotta prove that she
Ain't just another coon Uncle Tom fool
Like these MCs, gotta give 'em the rules
Lie to the youth, Uncle Tom you confused
Might as well give the Hip-Hop community a noose
Need a truce with the gangs and some food for the hungry
On Kerry nuts, he look at you like a monkey
You MCs on that old slavery path
The Bushs'll look at yo' ass and laugh
See, it's all about community, let's help ourselves
Cops brutalize us get dealt with with shells
It's our turn, it's 'bout time we win
Need somebody from the hood as my councilman, uh

[Hook: Kelis]
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit

[Verse 2: Nas]
Up in the steam room chillin', exfoliating the skin
Israeli men conversatin' on ends
Probably businessmen, I sense good taste
And they watch us, the spots an expensive place
Manhattan New York, I'm tryna keep steamin'
It's good for the lungs, had plans for the evening
This man leans in, his boys laughing
Now I'm the spokesperson for Black men, this always happens
Since all Black women care about is who got dough
And all we do is call them either bitch or a black ho
I say first brotha you ain't gotta be that cold
Since you ignorant, I'ma show you how the facts go
The biggest example in scandal of history
Were Monica Lewinksy or Donald Trump's pimping spree
Most women who love Givenchy or Gucci
Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies
But who are we to blame, not the dames
It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same
Beautiful creatures, Black girls birthed the earth
So they deserve the Hermes purse
Matter fact, I'm about to go shopping with my dime
Catch you cowards the next time, the next rhyme, uh

[Hook: Kelis]
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit

[Verse 3: Kelis]
I don't care about the runaways, I don't care about who's gay
I don't care about dying of AIDS, but I care if I got paid
Who even cares about the president?
I think we're making a mistake
I don't care about the hurricane as long as my family's safe
I don't care about the candidates, they burnt this country to bits
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way (Nas: Uh)

[Kelis]
Can we make a change, you know it's not overnight
Let's start the fight (Nas: And ya don't stop, uh)
Can we make a change
You know it's not overnight

[Verse 1: Nas]
I walk the blocks like whatever god, my message to y'all feds
Who desperate to arrest us young, benevolent hardheads
Abercrombie & Fitch rockin', wrist glistenin' marksman
Hitchcock of Hip-Hop since Big Pop departed
The project logic is still salute the dead, Glocks spit
Pour some juice out for those in Manchester, Beaumount
Otisville, Lewisberg, Fort Dix, Fort Worth, Oakdale
Every fed jail where all my dawgs lurk
War hurts much to gain 'til the day we all say
May your pain be champagne then we all blaze away
At our enemies, may they die easily
Long as they perish forever's what freedom means to me
Blowin' greenery, growing eager to see evil things
Thrown away, zonin' grey, GT, Diesel jeans
Airs and Chucks, solitaires, stones with the rarest cuts
On some Pretty Tone shit, haircut looks airbrushed
And they're aware of us though
And we don't give a flyin' 747 fuck though
Stayin' on my hus-tle

*beat change*

[Verse 2: Nas]
A message to those who trapped us up
From federal guys who backed them up
We never will die, we black and tough
Lead in your eye, we strapped to bust
Half of us been locked up inside the beast
Look at the time we see
Brooklyn to Compton streets, Queens
Even the Congo needs dreams
Our bullets and triggers our enemies
Pullin' on innocent women and children
It wasn't no ghetto killers
Who mixed up the coke and put guns in our buildings
But I'm not gon' cry and I'm not gon'
Just stand and watch you die
I'mma pass you a .9, I'mma grab your hand
Come on let's ride
A message to those who killed the king
Who murdered the Christ, the same regime
What God has built you never can break
What God has loved you never can hate
Man makes rules and laws
You just a ruthless dog, your kennel is waiting
You devils will run back into the caves you came from
Whenever that day comes, forty-acres
Plantations, see every race won
Sincerely yours, Street's Disciple, revelations



[Nas]
First I see a flashin' light, then on my own
I hear nothin', the smell of fire in brimstone
I feel hundreds arms grabbin' me, fallin' down the hole
Is it because there is no Gravity my body leaves my Soul
Is the Devil mad at me? will I go to Hell?
Or is it Heaven that awaits me?, is too early to tell
Is it now that I'm to be judged?
Will I face thee bright tunnel warm lights?
Will embrace me before force takes me
Like I'm movin' through high winds
See my self in baby carriages, relatives and friends
Things manifest, kings from every planets rest here
Beams of light hear the voice of the Nazareth near

[Hook: Nas]
You 'Amongst Kings' from both far near land
Made in my image son of God son of man
You came in the spirit for I am that I am
Father of all worlds Fallen Angel and the Lamb

[Nas]
Seen my body layin' down in the ground
It was painless, didn't feel a thing
Shots ring felt the anxious to get up and run
I was atheist, committed Suicide
I wish I could erase this shit
I seen a new life before the Christ
He created night & day, the sun & moon
From the virgin woman's womb
We lookin' down at my body, emergency room
Doctors frownin' at me surgical performs, I'm doomed
It's my day of judgment, eternal peace & fire
Far past the stars far past the Orion
I asked that you forgive father, I was tryin'
Many thrones in the light but only one's truly shinin'

[Hook]

[Nas]
Faster then the blinkin' eye, is the master and I
Face to face (uh) fightin' my case so we debate (where?)
Countin' all my sins (ok), where do we begin
When I stabbed the man in the train station or drunk gin
When I grabbed the man let the shells hit him from the Mac 10
It was all retaliation, (from what?) from way back then
Now I got the black Benz (and) trips from Aspen (and)
Disney World for my little girl and I'm askin'
You would recognize all the good deeds I'm worth (Dear God)
Send me on a trip God please the Earth
So I can deliver thou want it, stop playin'
He gave me life, I screamed out loud that "I Am..."
(Nas... Nastradamus)

[Outro: Nas]
And I saw another mighty angel come down from Heaven (I Am)
Clothe wit the cloud (Nastradamus)
And the rainbow was upon his head as a Crown (I Am)
And his face was lit as were the Sun (I Am)
And his feet as pillars of fire (Nastradamus)
And his name was Nastradamus (I Am)
(I Am Nastradamus)
Nas...
Nas...
Nas...



[Intro (Sampled)]
Angel Dust
Yeah, Angel Dust
Yeah
Yeah, Angel Dust

[Verse]
Angels with dirty faces, angels with broken wings
The devil's dust, PCP invading bloodstreams
People lining up to get it, fantastic, knew how to flip it
Illegal substance constructed and plus addictive
Trusted and respected, almost got me arrested
All the time I invested in school is now of question
Child prone to violence like a dog returns to its own vomit
A fool for chaos, taking what we could salvage
Hustling is a art, I'm just tryna be smart
Strung out bodies found in the park, Shaolin was my heart
We stood for loyalty, all we had was each other's back
My raps were like crystallized powder before crack
Raw, uncut, like what is sold in front of the storefront
The sidewalk was my brother's office
We cut our losses, I had choices
I took a pen, became the voice for the voiceless
My people walking in a zombie state
Life is short, even mine's at stake

[Interlude]
"The government says that angel dust can kill you if you take it or it can cause you to kill others."

"The scourge of angel dust has been linked to psychosis, violence, schizophrenia, and the epidemic runs especially rampant in the Bronx. My administration will hunt down these poison pushers and arrest them one my one until we get directly to the source."



[Hook]
I'm pregnant, don't know who the dad is
I'm happy, but this shit's the saddest
I'm maintaining, still keeping my status
Fuck what you haters say, my ass is still the fattest
Roll with the baddest, my girls in Gucci glasses
How could you pass this? Your loss
But I ain't tripping - I'm still the boss
I won't be another black girl lost
Lost, lost, lost, lost, Lost, lost
I wont be another black girl lost

[Verse 1]
Brown and beautiful, black and stunning, light and delicious
Chocolate colored strawberry kisses and cherry lipstick
Very mystic, bald stitches her wig
Kinky curly and dread, goddess gon' grant my wishes
Tantalizing touches, succulent skin, we should wed
Start off broke then stay together 'til we make it big
My queen is english, Sojourner Truth, I could learn from you
Never Ike Turner you, but look what you turn and do like
Get out of order, you're not a supporter of my dream
Rich girl fantasy schemes, a good man she needs
But she young and she speeding, honey now, what's the reason?
You just met this nigga, think you owe him a fucking threesome
So you lustin' to have a baby by a Denver Nugget
You don't love him, you want security, baby, your bugging
Financial liberty you're after, it's how you live
But the blood test shows it's not even his kid

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Chanel bags, everything
She shopping every time she gets a wedding ring
This her 3rd marriage, 4 carats
Brand new Jag, deserves to have it
Temptation, she can't let go her dirty habits
Mid 30's, spendin' dough at Magic
She's dancin', romancin', she's up at Mansion
She fucks all my mans, and they pop the magnums
So now what you gonna do, the morning-after pill is way overdue
'Posed to get married, now you embarassed
Who does this kid belong to?
Promiscuous, cuz' she got touched by step-dad, sex at
Such a young age, if you was a virgin, I'd get mad
Sick society, blaming yourself so wrong
I highly respect you, bet that, strong, intelligent
This song ain't to poke fun of you, to get laughs
I just love you, really love you
Here for you, wanna trust you
Wanna cuff you, be my lady
But first, I gotta see the baby

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ladies, I believe in you
We gotta stop this craziness out here, though
We gotta get right
Because when we both get right, we both take flight
Us real men need you, for real



[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Verse 1]
Uhh, rest in peace to Black Just
Riding through Jamaica Queens in his black truck
Timbs was forty below, waves to the side of his dome
Definition of good nigga, yo
Gangsters don't die, niggas only become immortal
Angels don't only fly, they walk right before you
In front of you
Its foul what this money could do
Cash corrupts the loyal
I hung with E-Money too, the fucking truth
Fucking with Stretch from Live Squad
I couldve died the same night that Stretch died
I just got out of his ride
He dropped me off and drove to Springfield
November 30th, another Queens king killed
It fucked me up, yall
I was just trying to make it with Steve Stoute
The legal way, drug-free route
Back in the days, they was sleeping on us
Brooklyn keep on taking it, Manhattan keep on making it
Trying to leave Queens out
But we was pulling them Beems out, them M3's out
Pumping bringing them D's out
Rastas selling chocolate weed inside of a weed house
Colosseum downstairs, gold teeth mouth
Astoria warriors, eight street, twin buildings
Vernon, cant even count the Livingston children
Justice in Ravenswood, nice neighborhood
Caught sleeping out there, be a wrap though
Bridge niggas be up in Peteys ten racks, yo
A simple bet on a serious cash flow
Get money, Manolo, welcome home Castro
Queensbridge unified all I ask for
Let's do it for DU, say what up to Snacks, yo
I just salute real niggas when I pass through, uhh...

[Verse 2]
Niggas is very hungry for that bank robbery
Bury money, trying to get to a Benz from a Hyundai
The Queens Courthouse right next to the cemetery
Niggas' rap sheets look like obituaries
You be starving in Kew Gardens
Bolognas and milk from a small carton
You could still feel chills from the team on 118
My nigga Bim fly by like it's a dream
His face on his Shirt Kings
Laced in a pinky ring, in his black Benz murking
Back when Black Rock and Ron was on the map
Cheeba in yellow sacks, dope sold in laundromats
Thugs bark, getting amped from weed
Over the heart of champions, see
Ever since back then, a nigga been about the dough
(You all know how the story GO!)

[Verse 3]
"Any other real niggas in the world besides us?" I ask
Probably is, but odds are well never cross paths
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell a story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This how we do, I see you DU
Queens to the heavens, salute the hood legends
Crack the Patrn, Hennessy and Glenlivets
Champagne bottles drowning out the sorrows
Hope the memories'll get us through tomorrow
I'm a real OG 'cause back in '93
Niggas couldn't fuck with me, sipping 'gnac since I was little
Laid back in a rental
Mouth shining, Eddies gold caps all up in the dental
Nigga getting money now
But you know I'm still mental but not simple
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling

[Verse 4]
Watch the calm realest channel his mom's spirit
Goosebumps cover me, mother's here, I could feel her
Blood of Christ covers me, our savior and healer
Drug prices up or down, I know a few dealers
And some accident murderers, they act like they killed on purpose
Liars brag they put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Better stay on point, if not it's curtains
Bebo Posse reincarnated through me probably
If music money didn't stop me
I never claimed to be the toughest
Though I'm to blame for a few faces reconstructed
It's the game that we was stuck with
Now I'm the only black in the club with rich Yuppie kids
Sad thing, this is the top, but where the hustlers went
No familiar faces around, ain't gotta grab the musket
It's all safe and sound, champagne by the bucket
Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit
Bo cooking blow, fuck is Slate at? Where Turkey went?
Old videos show niggas that was murdered since
Another reason to get further bent
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling



[Intro]
You are who you associate with
Look around at your five closest friends
And that's who you are
If you don't want to be that person
You know what you gotta do

[Chorus: Nas]
Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no man, but no man
Wants to die a poor man with no plan

Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no man, but no man
Wants to die a poor man with no plan

[Verse 1: Nas]
You can try to kill me, but I come back
Hate me, that's a small thing
Demons let the sword swing and sever off my offspring
Bitches try to see me down, hugging the floor
Bullets pulling me, playing tug of war
With my body, gravity got me
Police want me arrested, just to see me naked
Snakes want my necklace, fake niggas make me set-trip
Thugs shooting reckless (every night, niggas)
Wonder, how will I exit (from this life, niggas?)
Think you a killer, get cement shoes in the river
You should watch them people with you
Let them street rules hit you
If you hang around snitches, you get judged for that
'Cause you condone it, you know there ain't no love for that
There's slugs for that
Oh, you didn't know your man was talking?
That's why you stand with him, 'til you both land in the coffin
When you first heard he was snitching, then you should have thought
Every time this nigga got caught selling, they let him walk
Early on a nigga was taught, stay away from them niggas
So a nigga like Nas got nothing to say to them niggas
I fuck with, only the trusted thug clique
Who really done shit, run up in your bitch, bust the gun quick

[Chorus: Nas & Stic.man]
Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no man, but no man
Wants to die a poor man with no plan

Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no man, but no man
Wants to die a poor man with no plan

[Verse 2: Nas]
Some bitches lie a lot, they could be fly or not
Actresses cry a lot, their girlfriends spy a lot
They can shake your hand, girl
Then they take your man, girl
The whole hood knowing
We got something good going
None of these hoes is after me
'Til they saw us happy and that you bagged me
Now they wishing that they had me
So watch who you hang with, and who you cling with
You know these bitches ain't shit, they hoping to bank chips
(With a baller) after she done gave him some head
(He never called her) he gang it and he left her for dead
Birds of a feather fly together
But chickens don't fly, they eat their own shit and die
And you affiliated, now you look weak
'Cause your peeps is freaks
Credit card stealing hoes, well known in the streets
And they brought your down in the dirt
You was a pretty, young, smart thing
Going to work, I bet it hurt
'Cause you had a clean rep
But the girls you seen with make these niggas say
"I bet that bitch suck a mean dick", word

[Chorus: Nas & Stic.man]
Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no woman, but no woman
Wants to die a poor woman with no man

Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no woman, but no woman
Wants to die a poor woman with no man

[Verse 3: Stic.man]
A warrior walk alone, there's one spot on this throne
Fake friends be off and on, but a man stand up on his own
I'm raised by a different code, cut from a different cloth
Never been a follower, my momma told me be a boss
Watch who you hang around, don't let nobody bring you down
Friends come and go like seasons, leaves turn to brown
And some only come around when everything is green
Be careful not to let a snake infiltrate your team
For every Jesus there's a Judas, every Caesar there's a Brutus
If somebody tell you jump off a bridge -- are you gon' do it?
There's two types of influence: either healthy or deadly
Keep your circle small, away from all the hate and the envy
Don't come nowhere near me with it, I'm bullshit intolerant
My politics boss up, for you black empowerment
I stay in my element, Braveheart intelligent
Only associate with those for my betterment
I'm out for dead presidents to represent mines
Only click with my kind, my best friend is my grind
Everybody got big dreams, but few follow through
And it's deep: the company you keep become apart of you
Don't just be sitting around smoking weed, letting time fly
If your homies don't inspire you to rise, tell 'em bye
You're better off dolo than rolling with a weak ass crew
I'm like Scarface: Who I trust? -- Me, that's who

[Chorus: Nas & Stic.man]
Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no woman, but no woman
Wants to die a poor woman with no man

Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no woman, but no woman
Wants to die a poor woman with no man

[Intro: Ronnie Gee sample]
"Warning-Warning-Warning-Warning
New York-New York-New York-New York
The sound-The sound-The sound
You about to hear-to hear-to hear-to hear-to hear-to hear-to hear"

[Refrain: MC Shan sample (Nas)]
"You love to hear the story
How it all, how it all, got started, got started" (start it off)
"You love to hear the story
How it all, how it all, got started, got started, ah yeah!"
"You love to hear the story
How it all got started"
(Start it off, start it off, start it off, start it off)
"Back when-back when-back when-back when
Back when-back when-back when-back when"

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yeah, yeah
The ill reminisce and think about the fly days
Nothing like them 80s summer NY days
Hop on the MB5 days
Mopeds, Pro Keds, city split five ways
How it all started, fifth floor apartment
A jigsaw puzzle aerial view of the projects
A kid saw struggle, buried a few of his partners
Now I chill in resorts, enjoying massages
Check out the oracle bred from city housing
Nas, I arise the dead by thousands
I remember seeing Shan chilling near his Audi (near his Audi)
Hollis had Run and them but I proudly
Put a poster up of Shan and Marley, that was art kid
You love to hear the story how it started
The bubbly I'm pouring wasn't popped yet
Before there was an audience to watch us
I assure you there was a process, yeah

[Refrain: MC Shan sample (Nas)]
"You love to hear the story
How it all, how it all, got started, got started"
(How it all got started, yeah)
"You love to hear the story
How it all, how it all, got started, got started"
(How it, how it all got started) ah yeah!
"You love to hear the story
How it all got started, got started"
(Hear the story, how it all, start it off
Start it off, start it off, start it off
How it all got started)
"Back when-back when-back when-back when (back when)
Back when (back when), back when-back when-back when"

[Verse 2: Nas]
To call them fake today is hate, real niggas extinct
Pac left me inside a rap world with niggas that wink
At other rappers, undercover niggas spit every way
Won't be surprised if all their rides have federal plates
Let alone their wardrobes and Studio 4 flow
It was real when I appeared, it would've been some jaws broke
Nas, my real name, stage name, same thing
How could you let these lames claim king, I'm so ashamed, man
I light a L for Vernon for niggas who would burn in Hell for Vernon
10th Street, 12th Street, Nightmare on Elm Street
Pimps creep, delve deep inside the editorials
Of the ghetto queens, kings, stories true
Who possesses the testicular fortitude
To blow away myths that's a hindrance to all of you
You blame your own shortcomings on sex and race
The mafia, homosexuals and all the Jews
It's hogwash point of views, stereotypical
Anti-Semitic like the foul words Gibson spewed
And it's pathetic, I don't get the credit I deserve
That's why I hate doing interviews
But I don't sweat it, study long, study raw
My man Dion said Nas over-think the songs he writing
I'm not a wack performer standing near a corny hype man
I got the Donism in me, I'm here to enlighten

[Refrain: MC Shan sample (Nas)]
"You love to hear the story
How it all, how it all, got started, got started"
(Yeah, how it all got started, yeah)
"You love to hear the story
How it all, how it all, got started, got started"
(How it, how it all got started)
"You love to hear the story
How it all got started, got started"
(Hear the story, how it all, start it off
Start it off, start it off, start it off
How it all got started)
"Back when-back when-back when-back when (back when)
Back when (back when), back when
Back when, (back when) back when"



[Intro]
Turn your radios up
You are now allowed to listen to the radio
The real niggas are back on the radio

[Verse 1]
Uh, no slackin', no beggin', no askin', no fastin'
No disrespect to Islam nor Imam or Pastor
No answers to questions the media's askin'
Why we fight each other in public in front of these arrogant fascists?
They love it; puttin' old niggas verse the youngest
Most of our elders failed us, how could they judge us? Niggas
There's verbal books published by niggas, produced by niggas
Genuine niggas, so I salute my niggas
Not mad 'cause Eminem said, "Nigga," 'cause he my nigga
Wigga, cracker, friend - we all black within, okay?
We all African, okay
Some Africans don't like us no way!
A killing happened in Johannesburg, yesterday
Slain artist named Lucky Dube, hijacked
Some say N-double-A-C-P, keep us sidetracked
But I don't buy that, I buy Aston Martins
Faster cars than, NASCAR cars and, sparkin' while ridin'
Critics, eat a dick! Journalists see I'm rich
With this N-word jargon I'm just startin', bitch!

[Chorus]
I'm a nigga, he's a nigga, she's a nigga, we some niggers
Wouldn't you like to be a nigga, too?
To all my kike niggers, spic niggers, guinea niggers, chink niggers
That's right, y'all my niggas, too
I'm a nigga, he's a nigga, she's a nigga, we some niggers
Wouldn't you like to be a nigga, too
They like to strangle niggers, blamin' niggers, shootin' niggers, hangin' niggers
Still you wanna be a nigga, too? True

[Verse 2]
Wake up in the morning, shake my third leg in the toilet
Uzi on the nightstand, I'm the man you go to war with
Not the man you go to war against, patience, I'll get you
If that means I can't sleep a whole year, I'ma get you
I'm official not "A-Tisket" or "A-Tasket"
I'll put you in the casket, with the biscuit or the ratchet
They smoke hibiscus, they plants or trees, advanc-ed weed
Don't forsake us, you all are fake bloods like move make-up
I flow tighter as Tootie's braces, who be hatin' us?
I be on a state bus in shackles if my .8 bust
'Cause y'all some tellers, opposite of bankers
I'm the shit for ages, my clique still real QB gangsters
Clique still movin' like Freemasons
So if I'm on the flow for the law, there's lodges all across the nation
Nas is bred for the plan, to hold the Grand
Dragon's head in my hand, come and get me, here I am

[Chorus]
I'm a nigga, he's a nigga, she's a nigga, we some niggers
Wouldn't you like to be a nigga, too?
To all my kike niggers, spic niggers, guinea niggers, chink niggers
That's right, y'all my niggas, too
I'm a nigga, he's a nigga, she's a nigga, we some niggers
Wouldn't you like to be a nigga, too
They like to strangle niggers, blamin' niggers, shootin' niggers, hangin' niggers
Still you wanna be a nigga, too? True

[Intro: Nas]
Peace y'all, yeah
This one right here goes to my most loyal, loyal, loyal, loyal ones
You for me and me for you
We see things alike
We live alike, in truth

[Verse 1: Nas]
The craziest things already happened, get me
Could tell you 'gon be laughing at me or you laughing with me?
My baby's mom made a book about me, she tried to out me
In Barnes & Nobles new release section she's confessin'
Now the streets guessin' the beefin' started over some woman
Couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth
Was she looking for fame? yo I hope she got it
Since then I been the object, gossip people tried to target
All women should bid
For keeping real fathers away from their kids
These rappers talkin' real shit I lived
How many been married, divorced, their ex lady wildin'
Hires a lawyer, judge awards 'em monthly eighty thousand
Stevie Wonder sent me word that he was in my corner
Blind but still sees the pain of a young performer
Used to be my rib thought it was 'til death do us
She married again and I'm wishin' all the best to her
Got me looking for my mother, all I see is suckers
She lookin' over me now sayin' don't trust 'em
Come on I'm livin', I don't need many to pray for me
Her bad, she wanna keep the kids away from their dad
Tell you lames something, spit some game
Planes carry me to Madrid, Spain, so why complain?
When you place blame, then you're defective
When you take blame, then you're respected
You gotta give me credit

[Chorus: RaVaughn]
Woah
Life is good, I must admit it
Woah
Ups and downs, we've all been through it
Woah
Ain't no other way to do it
Woah
Life is good, it's good, it's good

[Verse 2: Nas]
Uh
The craziest things just happened to me, get me
So now whatever happens next it probably won't affect me
How many people owe the feds, keep it real especially
If you an artist in this music game, the smartest ones get abused for their change
And my life is sex, super stardom, and stupid cash
So unpredictable not aware you could lose it fast
I signed my own checks, swore we paid the IRS
Somebody's stealin', I swear to God
Tsk, for now, I invest
To my incarcerated team who got life
It's not right but you still got your life
Rest in peace to Gil Scott from the kill or be killed blocks
Not from Philly but a nigga done hustled them hilltops
Commercial pop artists get all the accolades
I give a million cash away to be revered like Donny Hathaway
Probably not as half as paid as I should be
But I stay in some cars and stay in some pussy
It's a beautiful life
Beautiful life, beautiful life

[Chorus: RaVaughn, Nas]
Woah
Life is good, I must admit it (Yeah)
Woah (Beautiful life)
Ups and downs, we've all been through it
Woah (Life's still good)
Ain't no other way to do it
Woah (Yeah, yeah)
Life is good, it's good, it's good

[Verse 3: Nas]
A thin line from this gangsta life and rap stuff
I can say I never been punked, robbed, or smacked up
Proud to say I never been chased, jumped, or backed up
Or extorted for my pay stubs
Lucky or blessed from what prayer does
'Cause hey, I was riding in caravans with AK's and gloves inside 'em
And if I should spare that man who violated my trust
I gave him a pass
My man called and I value his judgement
I let it ride and thought no more of it, it's over
So if it's my turn to be on the other side of the gun
I'm granted my four leaf clover, no one's leaving me colder
'Cause I chilled and let you breathe, yes
Let's go our own ways and let the beef digress
I done seen insanity close up, schizophrenia shows up in most us
My younger brother knows this
Not Jungle, got another brother in PA
Spazzed on' em, hurt me to put hands on 'em 'til this day
I gotta say I got some fam across the USA
Cackalack to Kansas but my mans around the way had contacts
They was Spanish coppin' grams and cooking 'ye
Willie, Bo, blowing haze, Mayo next door
Joe, Martin, Slade, I'm solo these days
It wasn't my fault
I never knew the time of death and maturity would sever my crew up in New York
Barely survived
Large, I thank you for teaching me not to pop my letter P's in the booth
How to control my vocals and spit poetically smooth
Akinyele, you knew
I was your brother 'til death
Back when you put me on to NiQuay from Lefrak
You was a dime, we was nobodies
Say what's up to Shameek, send my love to Yadi
I pray we all get old if I never again go gold and sell tickets
We could all still kick it
It's a beautiful life
Beautiful life, beautiful life

[Outro: Nas]
Rest in peace to my brother Talik
Gone too soon
God bless your soul brother
He was wild
Some things we just can't explain
Life
It's messed up how much time get wasted that you can't get back
With your kids at an early age
First steps, first words
I can't see 'em cause you mad
Don't put yourself before the babies
Don't say crazy things to hurt that man
You hurt him enough
The good times outweighed the bad
When it was good, it was great
But because I could see him now through the courts, you mad
Okay that's how it is out here
That's life huh
You see we can't be selfish out here
We gotta live and let love
Let the light in
To the beautiful mothers of my kids
And all the mothers around the world
Knight, Destiny
Life is good



[Intro:]
Yeah
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore I could see
Through my belly button window who I am...

[Verse 1]
I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching cause I'm nervous
Thought my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo
Developing eyes looking out my belly button window
My father's face wears a frown
And I'm wondering if they even want me around
Cause I'll go back to spirit town
So I could rest longer before I come back down
The chute again, in the near future when
My moms and pops can agree on this
Was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist
He dumped me off, first they want me then turn around and they dont
You got a 120 days do what you want
But as for me coming back this be my last time
Abort me, keep me, give me away, make up ya mind

[Hook: Nas]
I shot my way out my mom dukes

[Verse 2:]
They must wanna keep me, cause 4 months past and I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an ill-will to survive
When I look hard the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms is laying down cause I get bored and start to get live
Move side to side hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm thats no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food through my mothers tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me
But month 3 was closer, see
Thats when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved cause he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered if I am born will I be safe at all
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
Septemeber 14th, 73
Get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me
Arms open cause they know when I drop, alot of shit's gonna stop
See how the goverment will start re-training cops
Month 9, I'm a week over due, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face he's so proud
Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he said "At least that nigga ain't ugly!"
Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body
She loved me,and I plan to over through the devil
Y'all bout to see this world in trouble
Motherfuckers...



[Verse 1 - Nas]
If Macy's don't have it
A hatred addict
I need faces mad with frowns when I'm around
Or I'm wasting fabric
I don't feel great until my plushest pieces
Cause you to suck your teeth
Some mean-mugging on my clean thugging mean nothing
Women dream I'm your husband
I'm Alex Pushkin, the black poetry writing Russian
Ice disgusting. I started bling
How could you question my direction?
I'm king, I'm cultured, not just cause of
The foreign movie posters, the frames
Starring French names, look closer
? to the worm food
I despise and watch fake wise guys who turn stool
And speak highly of late made guys who once ruled
Hard-bottomed shoes, chauffeurs flaunt ambrosia
My baby moms wrote a book that couldn't harm a soldier
Muhammad Ali hobbies, no pilates, jogging, jumping rope
Til my body cut up like a bag of dope
And hope I die ?

[Hook - Nas]
Worked too hard, stayed up too many nights
If I'm wrong for being me, I don't wanna be right
Nah! No not never, no not ever
I don't wanna be right, hood star, we are

[Verse 2 - Nas]
Diggi-diggi-dignitaries, Carhart congress
Fitted hat high rank officials
World Bank like Rothschilds
Take the wool from over your eyes
Who conspired to deceive you and I
It's easier for a man to believe a big lie
Than a small truth. Money's not evil
It's the love of money that's the root
Not a luxury car worshipper, but I purchase
Particular vehicles, so me and my dudes, we can cruise
Upsetting policia They study my natural sleepy eye
To see if I'm high. I got my piece of the pie
My 40 acres is my 40 karats on my piece, that's fly
Carti bracelet, you talk that talk and walk that walk
You wouldn't understand our thoughts
How many black leaders are bought
Why the fuck you care if I rap about
How much my sneakers cost? I'mma floss

[Hook - Nas]
Worked too hard, stayed up too many nights
If I'm wrong for being me, I don't wanna be right
Nah! No not never, no not ever
I don't wanna be right, hood star, we are



[Intro]
New York city in the early morning after a night of no electric power. What it did have in the dark streets was a wild outburst of crime. Arson, looting, mugging, and a thousand false fire alarms. At 9:34 last night it all went black

[Verse 1]
I pour some Yac for the days of way back
The turn tables crates of wax turn to major to my earlier days
My world was ablaze, black outs in the summer
No electricity asked out
Breaking down doors, my city was hungry
We vandalized stores, poor
No lights in the project hall
Before the lootin' only 5 DJ crews was movin'
Till people stole DJ equipment the numbers risin'
Now there's friction
First time in Bronx history DJ's poppin' up, there's more mixin'
Everybody wants to be Flash
His name on the flier
The Grandmaster performin' live, no acclaim was higher
He was king and the dream was to be like 'em
Meanwhile C-Cypher's not around
Firehouses shut down
School was closed
Grandmaster (?) our domes with rules
Written inside the rap scrolls

[Interlude]
The revolution will not be televised

[Verse 2]
The revolution may not be televised
And we wonderin' who the hell is Koch
This man Koch wanted the mayor's seat
And he's campaignin' like he can't be stopped
Up in the Bronx they forever strong
Don't ever try to play 'em weak
The revolution may not ever be televised
Books command the speech

[Outro]
I want to stress first my total outrage that at this hour the city of New York is still without power



[Chorus]
(You're a big girl now)
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
(No more daddy's little girl)
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around
(You're a big girl now)
She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh
(No more daddy's little girl)
I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba

[Verse 1]
I'm the type that'll get you by the fireplace
Get you hype when I lick it, put it by your face
Sipping red wine, is it bedtime
You can kick it with your nigga while we listen to Faith
I'm feeling richer today,I can hit it then stay
Lingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play
We got champagne, whipped cream, I'ma grab a bucket of ice
Bubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right
It's your night, no stress, no fight
Mad at your ex, 'cause his dough tight
Never go right when you're with him
Try your best to forget him
'Cause it's easy to please me
CD skip when your head board hit the wall
Call for the lord
Right when you cum, I'm biting your tongue
Make your legs cramp up, you can't stand up
You can hit a blunt if you want
I'ma pull my pants up
We can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust
Tell me what's the reason for us
To love or to fuck
I'm the thug that you want
If it's gangster we can't front
If you want me I can stay around
If you need me, I'm here for you
How that sound?
Now it's up to you
Depending on how you wanna get down
'Cause you're a big girl now

[Chorus]
(You're a big girl now)
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
(No more daddy's little girl)
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around
(You're a big girl now)
She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh
(No more daddy's little girl)
I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba

[Verse 2]
Got your name and your number in my cell phone
Hear your voice and I wonder where you are, if you all alone
If you in a good mood, if you not
Or you thinking bout you was at my spot
What we did when we got hot
Is you dreaming you had me?
Is you creaming your panties?
Like a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me
On the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink
And we ate each other like candy
Under the covers, two intimate lovers
You fuck a nigga like you mad at me
Throw the ass to me
You should be glad to be
In the presence of a real thug as bad as me
While I'm in the streets with my murdering squad
You talking to your friends that I'm hurting it hard
How I'm making my rod, how I make you say "Oh God"
Every ho that you know wanna know Nas
Gotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard
'Cause you know how these girls are
Wearing tight shit, no panties, no bra
Running up to my car with menage a trois suggestions
Starting to get an erection
Guessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing
Complexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave
I need time to breathe
Wanna follow me, ironically
You pop up, throwing bottles at my Tahoe
Like it's my fault
But you don't wanna talk
Don't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden
You and the shorty start scuffing
Now shorty dumping you out
Can't let her get the best of you
So I rescue you
Only thing left to do was to grab her
So you can jab her, get a cheap shot
You don't wanna feel chumped
Now here the cops come
So we gotta run to the ride
Then we drive off through the traffic
Don't panic, but you know how we gotta manage
Looking at your face
And the damage in your facial
Every angle can't let it faze you
No reason to be insecure or immature
Baby girl, see the world is yours

[Chorus]
(You're a big girl now)
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
(No more daddy's little girl)
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around
(You're a big girl now)
She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh
(No more daddy's little girl)
I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba
(You're a big girl now)
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
(No more daddy's little girl)
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around
(You're a big girl now)
She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh
(No more daddy's little girl)
I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba



[Verse 1]
Get yours nigga
'Cause I'ma get mine
In due time
Everybody gotta shine
Get yours, I spray nines
I say this one time
The last time, I swear to y'all
I'm from where
The dope fiends is at
And killers crawl
And snitches call police
On these niggas, and street
Corners everybody's like
Smokin' marijuana and
Snuffin' niggas in faces and startin' drama and
Shootin' niggas, cold blood, just kill 'em, so what
With the fo' pound go nuts
Better slow up
Before you get your ass sewn up
Nigga never gon' grow up
Drinkin' the Henny
But he know he gon' throw up
Tryin' to make crack sales
What it look like? Future for a black male
Don't want to make my momma cry
On a front page for a homicide
Fly whips, all I wanted to drive
Where chicks get blunted and ride
Do 105 in the fast lane
And a fast pace, chasin' the papes
Spendin' chips on big chains
And the dimes that give brains
That was a 80's and 90's thing
Now I'm into big things

[Chorus]
Nah, I ain't fuckin' with you
Now I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
'Cause now I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gon' ride with you
'Cause now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't do that shit no more
Now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't fuck with you
I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners
I'm into big things
Tired of talkin' small talk
I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things

[Verse 2]
When I started this
All I wanted was cars and cribs
Like other rap artists but
Do I know where I'm goin' to?
Can I forget when I came from?
I be showin' you
Another style I'ma flow for you
Can I make somethin' wild
I can throw for you, flow for you
Make it bi-coastal
Take it to heights
That some of y'all can't come close to?
Some of y'all
Want to talk like hoes
Worse than bitches
And when y'all niggas see me blow
Bet it hurt like stitches
No competition
I stop and twist 'em
Hit 'em like a mafia proposition
I rap and y'all stop and listen
Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in
Look up at a nigga, now
Rocks that glisten
Can't stop my mission
Make another LP drop
I'm hittin' with the new shit, exclusive
No time to get caught up in a crime
I ain't have shit to do with
Used to chase the hoes
Now I chase the dough
Is y'all bitches gonna help me get paper?
No!

[Chorus]
Nah, I ain't fuckin' with you
Now I'm into big things (ill)
Gotta get my life together man (uh huh)
'Cause now I'm into big things (big things)
Nah, I ain't gon' ride with you (nah not no more)
'Cause now I'm into big things (fuck y'all)
You know I can't do that shit no more (why?)
Now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't fuck with you (why?)
I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners (why's that?)
I'm into big things (uh)
Tired of talkin' small talk
I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things

[Verse 3]
I go past y'all (UH-HUH)
Y'all got the glass jaw (UH-HUH)
And when I hit it, admit it
Y'all on ya ass y'all (UH-HUH)
We on the same team
You don't wanna pass the ball
Chuck and gunnin' for dough
You want to score
But you really don't know how to to ball
I put you on
It was me that introduced you to wealth
Crossin' me is like shootin' yourself
Wanna blow so fast, now do it yourself
You ain't shit now
You was so ill, why you never came out?
Where ya clique now?
Where you sit now? In the back seat
Mad 'cause I flip styles and I pack heat
Make you run laps like a pro athlete
And I done that
From my experiences
I appear relentless
Take more time
Just to hear my sentence
I'ma tell you what's real
And what could stop you from makin a mil'
You could prevent this
When niggas don't see eye to eye to you
Lie to you
Wanna get high with you
Want to eat food off of your labor
And take food off your table
'Cause they don't see your vision
Don't understand your mission
Is to make history
While you here
How long you plan on livin'?
Not for forever
At least to 140
Pray for me, I'm tryin' to eat
Like the niggas who bought
Motown off Berry Gordy
Good God

[Chorus]
Nigga I'm tired of games
I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
'Cause now I'm into big things
Tired of talkin' small talk
'Cause now I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things
Man we already did that
Now I'm into big things
No time to get sidetracked
Now I'm into big things
Get money now besides that
Some more big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things



What, what...yeah

[Verse 1: Nas]
I ain't seen as much death, nor seen as much crime
Since the blackout in Queensbridge in '79
Everybody's a killer now; pimps, playas, and dons
Shorties on the block push drops and carry on
Niggas look through our window wherever we drove
Through the tint, to see if the Benz is matching the clothes
We the Queens kings, I used to view the cats that are old
Seeing things that made me real from my skin to my soul
Girls who turned hoes, friends who turned foes
Bad luck niggas who bring death wherever they go
Never sleep, it feels better to know
It's all real though

[Interlude]
Everything is real
Where we Headed now?
Up to more money, would be more fun
Leave with mo' bitches, carry more guns
Where we headed now? Where we going, yo?
It's getting real, son; we gon' let it flow
Where we Mo' bitches, it be more dough
It be more fun, holding more...

[Verse 2: Nas]
How the hell are we supposed to excel from the street
Where the Jake's crew face young kids who wanna eat?
Quantum Leap to this Black world, hustlers and ghettos
Self-made millionaires who tussle with the devil
Bust a lil metal lead, wrestle you, to the pebbles
On the hard ground, that's if your guard down
It's a struggle, brothers jump bail
To come chill with they niggas on the block, with them rocks for sale
On the horn with the god Shapelle, my Queens comrade
Yo, run and come in with the dime bag

[Verse 3: Shapelle]
Ayo, I need dat, I got to smoke dat
Send me some Chunky Black, so I could smoke away the pain
Try to find my brain, but the thought still remain
Yo, it's on again once the death stunts these chains
'Cause I been through it; the drug game, I thought I knew it
I got knocked, took it to trial, but I blew it
25, but only lived 20 years of my life
Took 5 from me; got me wrapped up like a mummy
Now I'm in the system a.k.a. the devil's home
Where they tell you where to eat, sleep, shit, and use the phone
Now I'm living with, drug dealers, and chain stealers
Bitch niggas who got knocked and turned squealers
Imagine, sharing a cell with a rehabilitated addict
Who love fucking with faggots, but I civilized the savage
I sat him down and made him study mathematics
Now I'm sitting in the cell thinking...
About this reefer I'ma get this weekend
On the V.I., I rather be... uh, damn, damn



[Intro]
[Girl 1] Hello?
[Girl 2] Whassup girl
[G1] Ain't nothin - this nigga in here stressin
Talkin that old off the wall back to Africa shit again
[G2] What, that God Body shit?
[G1] Yeah, that dumb shit
I'm tryin to get up OUTTA here
[G2] I hear that.. but yo, you know the spot is pumpin tonight
[G1] Word f'real where?
[G2] You know, where the real niggas is poppin the Cristal
Not that White Star!
[G1] Ha hah! Word where the real niggas at?

[JoJo Hailey]
Listen.. to reason
Pretty baby baby listen

[Verse 1: Nas (JoJo Hailey)]
A young wild beautiful love child
You like them thug style link rocking, then mink copping
Hit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink popping
The head'll make you take 'em shopping, a foul doctrine
Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit
Chanel looking real, airbrushed nails
Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (so fine..)
To see a prophecy, your ebony tone is locking me
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
Wishing I could be the one man; but you juggle
Way too many Willies all in one hand
You wanna run up in clubs, getting rubbed on
Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear
Get your fuck on - following week, you back there
But what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars
Puffing with some lil nigga, husband not knowing she's out
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas
Niggas thirst you, you just let 'em hurt you and leave
What up ma, fronting like you naive
Push your man's whip, calling police when you flip
Can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us
But for now that's a whole different zone from us, word!

[Chorus: Nas (JoJo Hailey)]
Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive (trying to survive)
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playing the same ol' games
Messing with my mind, emotional thangs (messing with my mind)
(And there goes.. a black girl.. lost)

[Verse 2: Nas (JoJo Hailey)]
Like Isis, you got your heart broke and felt lifeless
Grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest
To who'sever getting down and trifless
To get his mind all you do is give him something priceless
'Cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs
More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed (deceit, yeah)
There you go again, starting wars, making me more yours
Seem to get a kick out of keeping me on all fours
Face glistening, I'm addicted to you
Original, Wisdom Body got me picturing you
Igloos of ice tricking on you, you never listen
To this nigga spending Franklins on tennis anklets
Must've had a bad deal in the past though
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain
You got a job part-time and school's your night thing
With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now
You getting interviewed, but your boss is into getting screwed
Typical day that the black girl sees
Coming home wanting more from a college degree

[Chorus: Nas (JoJo Hailey)]
Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive (trying to survive)
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playing the same ol' games
Messing with my mind, emotional thangs (messing with my mind)
(And there goes.. a black girl.. lost)

[Verse 3: Nas (JoJo Hailey)]
Where are you focused, on legit niggas and where the coke is
Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo you seem hopeless
Your value - too much to be measured, I wonder how you
Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amounting to
More than the world, but not knowing nothing about you
You leaving the crib, taking all your kids out to
Drop them off, letting some nigga knock you off
So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost (you should be ashamed)
Growing up seeing it, it should remind you, you bein lied to
Everything that move be inside you
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to
They spot you out dancing topless in your drawers
Damn look, there goes a black girl lost

[Outro: JoJo Hailey]
You should be ashamed of yourself
The way you carry yourself
The way you hang out all night long
Doing silly things that is wrong
Black girl lost



[Intro: Barack Obama]
They said this day would never come
They said our sights were set too high
This country is too divided, too disillusioned
To ever come together around a common purpose. They said

[Chorus: Johnny Polygon (2Pac sample)]
("Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president")
("Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president")
Yes we can change the world, the world, the world
{CHANGE THE WORLD...} they say
("Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president")
("Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president")
Yes we can, change the world
The world, the world, the WORLD...

[Verse 1: Nas]
They forgot us on the block, got us in the box
Solitary confinement: how violent are these cops?
They need a early retirement
How many rallies will I watch? I ain't got it in me to march
I got a Semi to spark, the game's in a drought
Public housing, projects, cooking up in the Pyrex
My set, my clique, either getting money
Or running from homicide trail, that's if they ain't died yet
Trying to be rich, still I'm pledging allegiance
A predicate felon, a ghetto leader
Lending my poetical genius, to whoever may need it
I bleed this from Queensbridge, now living with my feet up
Never defeated, so a president's needed
You know these colored folks and Negros hate to see
One of their own succeeding
America: surprise us and let a black man guide us, uhh

[Chorus: Johnny Polygon (2Pac sample)]
("Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president")
("Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president")
Yes we can, change the world
{CHANGE THE WORLD...} they say
("Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president")
("Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president")
Yes we can, change the world
The world, the world, the WORLD...

[Verse 2: Nas]
What's the black pres' thinking on election night?
Is it: "How can I protect my life?
Protect my wife? Protect my rights?"
Every other president was nothing less than white
Except Thomas Jefferson had mixed Indian blood.. and Calvin Coolidge
KKK is like: "What the fuck?!", loading their guns up
Loading up mine too, ready to ride
'Cause I'm riding with my crew - he dies, we die too
Yeah, but on the positive side
I think Obama provides hope and challenges minds
Of all races and colors to erase the hate
And try to love one another, so many political snakes
We in need of a break, I'm thinking I can trust this brother
...but will he keep it way real?
Every innocent nigga in jail gets out on appeal
When he wins, will he really care still?
I feel

[Chorus: Johnny Polygon (2Pac sample)]
("Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president")
("Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president")
Yes we can, change the world
{CHANGE THE WORLD...} they say
("Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president")
("Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president")
Yes we can, change the world
The world, the world, the WORLD...

[Verse 3: Nas]
Say a prayer for "Do we have to?"
You ain't right, Jeremiah Wrong pastor
In love with a slave master
Sincerely yours, USA's most brave rapper
Jesse carjacker, Uncle Tom kidnapper
Ask around: Bentley coupe off the Richter
Bitch called "Life": I pimped her, what
Politics, politricks, Klan-shooter
Deacon for defense, progress-producer
Nothing on the stove, a survival-booster
Gotta do what we gotta do
We ain't got no governors coming through to help
Anything we need done, gotta do for self
New, improved JFK on the way
It ain't the 60s again, niggas ain't hippies again
We ain't falling for the same traps
Standing on the balconies where they shot the King at
McCain got apologies; ain't nobody hearing that
People need honesty

[Chorus: Johnny Polygon (2Pac sample)]
("Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president")
("Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president")
Yes we can, change the world
{CHANGE THE WORLD...} they say
("Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president")
("Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president")
Yes we can, change the world
The world, the world, the WORLD...

[Outro: Governor Bill Richardson]
It is my distinct honor, and privilege to introduce
The next President of the United States - Barack Obama
{*crowd cheers LOUDLY*}

[Intro: Jay-Z (Nas) & Both]
I know you can feel the magic, baby
Turn the motherfuckin' lights down
Esco, whattup? (Whattup, homie?)
I mean, it's what you expected, ain't it? (Hahaha)
Let's go... uhh, uh, uhh, uh, uhh, uh
Turn the music up in the headphones
Uh, yeah, that's perfect (yeah, right, right)
Uhh, uh, you gotta take ya time, make a nigga wait on this muh'fucka (hahaha!)
Make niggas mad and shit like
Niggas usually just start rappin' after four bars, nigga, go in!
Just start dancin' in this muh'fucka
Yeah, (yeah) we just come outta nowhere

[Chorus: Jay-Z (Nas)]
I feel like a Black Republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, like, "Fuck it then"

[Verse 1: Jay-Z (Nas)]
Huddlin' over the oven, we was like brothers then (what?)
Though you was nothin' other than a son of my mother's friend
We had covenant, who would've thought the love would end?
Like Ice Cold's album (uhh), all good things
Never thought we sing the same song that all hoods sang
Thought it was all wood-grain, all good brain
We wouldn't bicker like the other fools, talk good game
Never imagine all the disaster that one good reign, could bring
Should blame, the game, and I could
It's kill or be killed, how could I refrain?
And forever be in debt, and that's never a good thing
So the pressure for success can put a good strain
On a friend you call best, and yes it could bring
Out the worst in every person, even the good and sane
Although we rehearsed it, it just ain't the same
When you put in the game at age sixteen
Then you mix things: like cars, jewelry, and Miss Thing
Jealousy, ego, and pride, and this brings
It all to a head like a coin, cha-ching
The root of evil strikes again, this could sting
Now the team got beef between the Post and the Point
This puts the ring in jeopardy  indefinitely

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Nas]
I feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, "Fuck it then"
I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them (nah)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, "Fuck it then"

[Verse 2: Nas (Jay-Z)]
I'm back in the hood, they like, "Hey Nas" (uh)
Blowin' on purp, reflectin' on they lives (uh)
Couple of fat cats, couple of A.I.'s
Dreamin' of fly shit instead of them gray skies
Gray 5s, hatah's wishin' our reign dies
Pitch, sling pies, and niggas they sing, "Why"? (uhh)
Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time
Weak minds keep tryin', follow the street signs
I'm standing on the roof of my building
I'm feelin' the whirlwind of beef, I inhale it
Just like an acrobat ready to hurl myself, through the hoops of fire
Sippin' 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire
Could it be the forces of darkness
Against hood angels of good, that form street politics?
Makes a sweet honest kid, turn illegal for commerce (uhh)
To get his feet out of them Converse  that's my word

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Nas]
I feel like a black republican, money keep comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, ah, "Fuck it then"
I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, "Fuck it then"



[Verse 1]
Uhh, yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow?
All we are is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes?
And you believe when they be telling you lie, all on the media?
They make the world look crazy to keep you inside?
Why you listen when the teachers at school
Know you a young single parent out struggling, they think you a fool
Give your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes
Killing shorty future, I wonder how do we last it?
Underground in they casket, ancestors turning
I'm learning something every day, there is no Lazarus
Words like God is Greek or Latin
So if you study Egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters
My niggas is chilling, getting high, relaxing
Envisioning, owning shit, yo it can happen
What do we own? Not enough land, not enough homes
Not enough banks, to give my brother a loan
What do we own? The skin on our backs, we run and we ask
For reparations, then they hit us with tax
And insurance if we live to be old, what about now?
So stop being controlled, we black zombies

[Chorus]
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)

[Verse 2]
Ayo, we trapped in our own brain, fucked behind bars
We've already gone insane
We've already gave up, cut our own heads offs
Stab our own backs and dream too much
Without fulfilling reality; too greedy and
Can't have one or two chains, we need three of them
Can't have one or two guns without squeezing 'em
On our own people and, fuck black leaders
'Cause whites ain't got none leading them, the rhythm is cosmic
Nas is divinity, the deity's prophet
Let's all get down and get up
Victims walking 'round with Down's Syndrome, all stuck
Fainting, shouting, catching Holy Ghost in church
Scared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doing it first
We begged, we prayed, petitioned and demonstrated
Just to make another generation - black zombies

[Chorus]
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)

[Verse 3]
You scared to be yourself, 'cause you in a trance
Feel free, hear the music and dance
If you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you
Dumb niggas with long beards like they Arabs or Jews
Or from Israel, Bismillah al rahman al rahim
Islam's a beautiful thing
And Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring
Peace against the darkness, which is ungodly
So what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow?
Use your own intuition, you are tomorrow
{*roaring*} .. That's the sound of the beast
I'm a Columbia record slave, so get paid
Control your own destiny, you are a genius
Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie

[Chorus]
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)

[Outro:]
Wake up! Black zombies in a spell for more than fo'-hundred years
Ghetto niggas won't have it no mo', can I get a witness?
Why listen to somebody else tell you how to do it
When you can do it yourself; it's all in you, do it, do it
Do it niggas.. c'mon, uhh, peace...



[Verse 1]
Blaze a 50, sit back in the drop top Azure Bentley
Of course with me, this chick'll make Bobby divorce Whitney
Brazilian candy, from Miami
Masseuse, wedding ring on, loving Celine Dion
Hate rap, told me where she get cake at
She's a part-time dancer, part time romancer
Tries to be a mother when she gets a chance to
Left her husband alone to raise they son, he's in Pampers
Modeled for a year, got her bachelors degree
33, recovering from plastic surgery
Went from 34B to 36 double D
Met her in San Diego at the Super Bowl party
Had the Henny, sipped it up with Terrell Davis
MVP, we flicked it up from Sports Illustrated
I was silked out, flossin' with Stoute, he had the 'gators
When she walked in, she lit up the room like Las Vegas
Terrell said her man's a fullback for the Raiders
A drunk who'd fuck cheerleaders and wind up in the papers
It's easy to get the pussy, just don't fall in love
Next thing you know I'm hugged up with this bitch in the tub
Palm Springs, Al Capone's Suite washin' her feet
Is this love? Somebody's wife fucking a thug
Hittin' it raw, tastin' it, wildin' out of my character
Tapin' it, Tyra Banks face and Faith's lips
Givin' head like she knew me for years
Pillow talk, she let out tears, told me 'bout her husband's affairs
Millions she would get if his neck got slit
She rolled the equality, then passed the lye to me
Told me 'bout her man's life insurance policy
He stays on the golf course, wears Le Coq Sportif
Evenings he drinks his wines on his private resort
You can take him there, here go the keys, you can slip in the rear
Chop a nigga up, yo, meet me somewhere
So we can make more money, then you could ever see rappin'
Split the cash and move to Venezuela, adaptin'
P-11's, ACP shells for blastin'
Caught him with his Spanish maid
He had a lighter with a can of spray, burnin' her legs
She tied to the bed, sex S&M, sadomasochistic
Sadistic, yoked her from behind, blew him out existence
His maid cried "No", lucky she was blindfold
Naked with mad burn marks all on her thighs, yo
Twelve point five million, he kept his funds
In the Lloyd's of London, goes to his wife and his children
Yo, I thought "What if shorty gets scared, electric chair's all I envision
All she'll probably get is psychiatric supervision"
I switched the plan, the maid flied to Switzerland
Fake ID, forged his wife name, catch the next flight
The same night, headed to Spain, nice game
Now we're back to where we meet a-gain...

[Verse 2]
Blaze a 50, sit back in a drop-top Azure Bentley
Of course with me, this chick'll make Bobby divorce Whitney
Top down, night air blow her hair
Sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare
Fast lane on the nine-five, honey laughs about the cash
Took a blast out of her coke bag
Snorted it, started screamin', yo we almost crashed
Earlier I took the coke out, replaced it with crushed up glass
Her head nodded down to her chest, slowly she fell asleep
Overwhelmed by greed, put to death



They dug me out the soil in the Mines of the Motherland
Now I'm misplaced, one hand to another hand
Illegal smugglin', people strugglin'
Wish they could just throw me back in the mud again
Yeah, guess that's how we got here
Slave Trade then the Diamond Trade
Every child's afraid
When his Mother and Father get sprayed
Forced in the Army, young killer Brigade
Gets a new name and then he give his nose glue
Til' his mind can't take what he's gon' through
Lookin' in that dirt for that ice so blue
Then The Royal Family, the ice goes to
And this thing has to change, feelin' half-ashamed
As I rap with my Platinum chain
When you shop for a gift for me
You think about the misery?
The same way we made Apartheid History
We can do the same thing to the conflict ice
But everybody wanna shine, right?

[HooK: Nas]
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
They wanna Shine on 'em
Shine on 'em X 7

[Verse 2: Nas]
My VVS glimmers on my chest
200-thou-encrusted watch on my wrist
I wonder how people starve to death
When God bless the land that lacks the harvest
The stone's equality, but they homes are poverty
And the whole world ignores the robbery
Bought my girl pretty rocks when she's mad at me
Tear-drop shaped, uh, perfect Clarity
It shocks, so many are killed annually
'Cause of greed, lust, and pure Vanity
Stop talkin' and do somethin' about it
Every Holiday Season, Jewelry stores crowded
Kids snatched from their homes, Mutilated alive
Husbands separated from wives, keep a Jesus piece to be fly
But back in the day there was a time when they called us shine

[HooK: Nas]
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
They wanna shine on 'em
Shine on 'em X 7



Italiano motto
Train like Cus D'Amato
Guard your plant
Recline low black milano
Blessed God feelin kosher
One in the top of the toaster
???
My nine is stuck in a holster
Dump quick
Chasing my dick
Made a bum bitch rich
Stalefish
Heard she naked in jail flicks
Mamacita
Black widow turned to be a back seater
Satin pillows a pimpstress in willow
Cookin my blow and heads low
Eye swellin
The son of the grain
I gotta split my wife's melon
So I can see the seven seeds of my circumference
Beaver lunged it
Polishin pistols at the gunsmith
Clever
My mama told me take cheddar
Buy slugs or drugs whatever calculate better
When cakes measured
Lock the front door secure
See the gleaming white crystal when its pure

Fuck the snake hoes and jealous ass niggas
That smash your Benz windows
Detecting fake niggas signals
Yo live niggas get it too
Scarin rappers like the fed time Gotti was acquitted to
Bloodshot red eyes, high
Yellow envelopes of lye
Opening cigars let tobacco fly
Kicks matchin my shit my gun on
Thinkin of names for my mans unborn
Spill the Puerto Rican rum on imaginary graves
Put my hat on my waves
Latter Day Saints scream religious praise
Heat grazed the baby yo
Foul shit made a welfare mom crazy
More bodies drop by the ratio
Paces flow
Grisly thoughts for makin dough
Haitian bitch cast a spell on my life for cash flow
So now its on never wasted a slug
Time is money
When it comes to mine
Take it in blood



[Intro]
Yo, I wonder if Langston Hughes and Alex Haley
Got blazed before they told stories
I'mma get blazed before I tell y'all stories
I saw on TV today, this man lost his son, his son died
So he had him cremated
Took his ashes and then made it to a diamond ring
Now he watches his son shine everyday
I just thought about that
While I sit here ashing in this ash tray, yeah

[Verse 1]
The making of a mad band, intricate stories of DeVante Swing
Ava Gardner, the crashin' of James Dean
Bobby Brown influenced by Rick James and it goes
Prince wanted Alexander O'Neal to be Morris Day or Jerome
But Alex was putting coke in his nose, nigga whylin'
Could be a myth, but I swear that the source was close
Phyllis Hyman killed herself, it was crazy
Mommy was bad they say
Donny Hathaway free-fall from a balcony, he swings

[Hook]
As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray
I could see my whole life fly past me
Did I? Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
And will the money and fame outlast me?
The blunts ash falls down in the ash tray
Well, I see my whole life fly past me
I'm asking, did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
Did I? Anything else you wanna know, just ask me

[Verse 2]
Sam trusted Womack with his main lady
He tossing in the grave like, "This is how you repay me?!"
A change gon' come, wish you didn't trust me so much
Marvin said "No mountain's high enough," fly stuff
David Ruffin was punchin' Tammi Terrell
Gave her concussions
While the Funk Brothers was laying down the percussion
When Flo from the Surpremes died, Diana Ross cried
Many people said that she was laughin' inside

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
John F. Kennedy's enemies dealt with treachery
It interests me. Judy Campbell in Gucci sandals
She's what a temptress be
The death of Ennis Cosby, what a mystery!
Or the Chicagoan Harold Washington
Someone is sabotaging 'em
Watch out for the traps
Larry Troutman killed his brother Roger Troutman
Then he killed himself, that's the end of Zapp
And I wouldn't change a thing, mistakes of the greats
This is what came from their pain
From their hurt we gain, an unfair exchange

[Hook]

[Outro]
I could smell old bogey cigars
Long record perfumes, smelling just as sweet
Me and my wife K, flying in a drop-top
Like Ruby and Ossie Davis, baby  know what I mean?
Yo, man, I get smoked out, and start thinking 'bout
Hattie McDaniel got a Oscar
For playing Mammy in "Gone with the Wind"
And she didn't get allowed
Wasn't even allowed to go to the premier
Believe that? Couldn't go to premier to her joint
Man, you know they were strong back then, man
Blunt from my ash tray, nothing gon' to live past me, yeah



[Intro]
So many niggas get fucked up in the game
See, that's where they get caught out there in that word "Game"
'Cause it's not no fuckin' game

[Verse 1]
When you hear shells coming at ya
Hot ones from a shotgun, I bet nigga runs faster
Loose a shoe to get away from a blaster
Think about that casketyou don't wanna be in that shit
Quick to take consignment; you taking everybody's package
Money over bitches was the law you practiced
So you act as if money was no object
Spendin' fazools, trips for your whole projects
Epcot Center, linens for ya bitches, Rolies for your dogs
Now we in the mall, slayed by his bitches
Every day I'm reminiscing, how he was living, having fun
'Cause any day coulda led to prison
Not for a short bid, 'cause if the feds ever caught kid
It'd be like 25 years conspiracy
Another 25 for RICO, snatching up him and his people
He had his jeep bulletproof, silencers on the Desert Eagle
Flipping bricks in Gary, Indiana
He had it locked down from the streets to the slammer
Only trusted two things: his trigger and his hammer
Used to be a bum 'til he had a six-month run
Had a lawsuit, 30 G's, the case was won
Met with Mexican Hoy, cop boya
Bought a barbershop, named it after seeing Sade
That's where they found his body, in a barber chair face down
Bullets in his chest, sliced apart from the waist down
Planned to sell his shop, stick Hoy for everything he got
Take jewels and his pies
Fill his shoes with cement and drop his body in the tides
But Hoy was wise
Even when he ain't around he got ears and eyes
Gotta stay a step ahead of this game to stay alive

[Chorus]
Always wanted fame, always wanted cash
To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass
Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5
Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive
Always wanted fame, always wanted cash
To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass
Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5
Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive

[Verse 2]
Cokehead Sandra, she grew in Gowanus
Her man was large and Sandra was his baby mama
Stayed in drama, fighting with hood rats that he was fucking
No job all day, she did nothing
They son was 7-years-old, she really was a wifey
First should she would transport blow, overnight for a G
He paid up front, they laid up once
She got pregnant, she wouldn't dead it
She had a boy, named her son Infinite after his father who did dirt
She didn't know disaster would follow
Capsules and bottles of crack in the back of his Mazda
He let her drive while he drove the burgundy 5
He often talk about how he wants to murder these guys
From off of Bergen Street, had mad work in the street
Lifestyle, richest nigga, far from how he used to be
Never thought he'd rock diamonds; never took weakness for kindness
That's how he gradually grew
Did a favor for a favornow the nigga in with the crew
And now he live major, house in Dix Hills next to Brooke Shields
With the cook and the maid, shit was real
Saved his first bills made in his bodega
"Good luck, player" sign on the paper taped in the window
Escaped from a would-be kidnap, and slept
Thought niggas feared his rep 'til he got wet
Woulda had the world in his hands, his girl did a scam
The owner's rich, is boning niggas to get rid of her man
Welcome to the game, baby

[Chorus]
Always wanted fame, always wanted cash
To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass
Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5
Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive
Always wanted fame, always wanted cash
To live fast, get the girls with the biggest ass
Fuck a 9 to 5, gotta drive a 5
Now that I got it, the hardest thing to do is stay alive
The hardest thing to do is stay alive
The hardest thing to do is stay alive

(Bonjour) I should be more mature, sure, I'm spoiled
Hit up the south of France after tour, bonjour (bonjour)
How many girls pre-bate right before they date
So she can have restraint? She still get slayed (bonjour)
That's ill behavior, want the whip matted
Want her ass the fattest, beat it: Thriller jacket
A street metaphor: if your dog piss on the floor
Put his nose in it, check these niggas from the door

Good day and best wishes

Eat at selective kitchens, speak on our next intentions
Over-creamy Polenta, it come chef recommended (bonjour)
Come through the side entrance; I arrived, bitches
Crackheads still owe me from '89 fixes (bonjour)
Havin' drinks in Vegas, my business
She didn't see me comin', now she's an eyewitness

Oooh oooh la la, oui-oui amour
Plenty of kisses, plein de bisous
Good day and best wishes
Comment allez-vous?

Vacation, twisted, whatever happened, missed it
Vacations I didn't like, put myself through a guilt trip (bonjour)
All these beautiful places, but the cities be poor
You wealthy when your kid's upbringin' better than yours
All this money we gettin' could be gone in a minute
If we don't invest itwe long-term affected

I got a mil for every bump on your face, that's what I call a blessin'
Flexin'

[Verse 4: The World Famous Tony Williams]
My head looks straight up
And I'm wonderin', "What did I do?" (bonjour)
She looked at me like, "Damn, did I surprise you?"
Sure enough, as the sky's blue, she turned back around
And walked back down the avenue (bonjour)
She's waitin' for the right cue (bonjour)
I'm waitin' for the right clue (bonjour)

[Outro: The World Famous Tony Williams]

In that white gown that I be seein' right through
Crowd obscurin' my view
There's nothin' left to argue (bonjour)
At least there's not from my view (bonjour)



[Intro]
Alchemist, you know me, man
I'm the type of nigga that write rhymes
Right on the spot in the studio soon as I hear the track
You know what I'm sayin'?
Word, but I wanted to bring
A couple of books to the studio today, man
I found these shits up in the crib, man, in boxes, man
I don't even remember when I was writin' these shits
Or what's in these shits, man
Probably a bunch of bullshit, man fuck it, check it

[Verse 1]
How can I trust you when I can't trust me?
Picture myself a old man, a O.G.
Some niggas will conversate with liars all day
Time pass (Nah, let me start somethin' else)
Soul on ice, death threats given by clowns
I guess livin' is prison when you live around clowns
I'm hexed, cursed, worse I been blessed first
I thought I was abnormal
Cause I would overcome any tasked called to
So there it is, I'm a prince, I'm against lames
Who do minor shit, swear they on the top of they game
Your rhymin' is called "Vagina Monologue," it kinda supports
Theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue
Rarely y'all come in contact with the real
Since Pun passed, he was the last shine of sun I could feel
Yo, said there's a few left since music's expressions of life
Damn, I wish I took more time to write in my book of rhymes

[Break]
Oh shit, Tina!
I been lookin' for this bitch number, damn
No, this rhyme is weak
This is weak, I remember this bullshit right here
(My book of rhymes)
Gandhi was a what the fuck?

[Verse 2]
Gandhi was a fool, nigga, fight to the death
The US Army is a school that teach you plights of conquest
(I wonder when I wrote thisnah, it's weak)
The money's your religion, sky the limit, live life
Numbers is big business, makes the poor live trife
The glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream
Through your existence become wealthy, knowledge is king
Pimps and card sharks, thiefs, murderers with hard luck
Addicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society
Cops that shoot blacks is routine for notoriety
Grow up watchin' well-dressed niggas with charms
Beautiful ladies on their arms
Dangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas
Rubbin' my lips with Campophenique
Still behind the ears wet, turned out to be
Pioneers vets amongst hustlers, crack sellers, and liars and squares
(Nah, that was weak there)
My people be projects or jail, never Harvard or Yale
Pardon me type in my two-way while I'm chargin' my cell
It's hard to be iced up with Gucci, God, poverty's real
I can't fight you, cause you would sue me, niggas be groupies
I see imitators tryin' to make albums, spittin' my style
And they don't even realize that I notice they stealin' Nas' shit
I pump some Rick James with that Teena Marie
My nina lean on me like Scoob and Scrap
This can't be my book of rhymes

[Break]
This can't be my book of rhymes, writin' this bullshit!
(My book of rhymes)
Nah, neva that! Fuck that!
Aw, why you laughin', Alchemist?
Hah, you a funny nigga...
Naw, yeah (My book of rhymes)
I'm tellin' you, I'ma come up with some new shit now
Fuck that! I'ma write again now, fuck that!
I musta been high on some shit what the fuck is this?!

[Verse 3]
Look how we treat pregnancy, women in the hood
Our values so low, our values are no good
Things our mothers told us we should've heeded
Cause now we need it, we older, almost able t
I'm jealous of you, how come you so beautiful?
Smellin' fresh, youthful, intelligent, while I'm stressin' and shit
Ayo, I envy you cause all you do is smile
And things come your way
Such a innocent child is what some say
I get upset cause I just want to be treated the way you are
Like a star, not a worry in this world thus far
But wait a minute, we both need your mother's attention
I must be crazy, jealous of my own baby infant (Kinda crazy)



[Intro] (Nas)
Yeah... ay yo Jungle... ay yo Wiz...
Come on man... Let's do this
It's a Braveheart party y'all
C'mon

[Hook] (Mary)
Throw your hands up cuz we wanna dance
Don't be afraid just take a chance
Cuz this beat will rock your body
Get up on the floor and party
Now y'all tell me what y'all wanna do
Thinkin' while I have a drink or two
Throw your hands up everybody
Get up on the floor and party

[Verse 1] (Nas)
I move at night, respect my gangsta
Ready for whatever you bring, the mood is right
The club is righteous, tight with family
Squeezin on big old bubbles with no panties
Ladies who's sexually free
And once in a while live on the wild side, kinky & nasty
Middle fingers up and say "Fuck the world"
Throw your hands up, they can't fuck with you girl
And my fellas, two time felons, two nine tote and lethal
Quick to leave you wide open, if you gettin' tore down
Blowin' a blunt cloud, and the DJ's makin' you feel thugged out
Put yo hands up

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2] (Jungle)
I pull in a V12 drop all red
Look at ma with that cat paw tat on'er leg
Come here girl can I kiss you, let me lick you
Show you what your body made for, you're official
You could be my baby mama lookin like that
What you drink, champagne or Cognac
What you like dancin diamonds, Dolce Gabbana
Fendi, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada
A nigga like Jungle to always come thru
Shine in yo hood whenever the fuck you want to
Cause I'mma B.R.A.V., E.H.E.A.R.T. from QB
Put'em up...

Repeat Chorus

Party all night (Party all night)
Let's drink, no fights (Let's drink, no fights)
Party all night (Whachu wan' do?)
Let's drink, no fights (Drink up...c'mon, yeah, yeah...)

[Verse 3] (Wiz)
I'm blaze, haze for days
Blackout thinkin' of ways to get paid
Mac out corner I got it's all laid
Shorty, with a nice round ass in my face
Now do she want me to touch her?
Or do she want me to see?
Fuck is she comin wit me
A true BHG Wiz, not complex
Chin checks if it get hectic
Nigga Braveheart respected
Get bent at the bar, talk shit, walk it
And if I can't talk it, the false big cop a case
I'm here to blaze, roll up a dutch and take it to the face
Throw yo hands up

Repeat Chorus 2X



[Chorus]
In America, you'll never be free
Middle fingers up, fuck the police
Damn, can't a nigga just breathe?
Braveheart, still QB's Finest
Grinding, enough diamonds to change the climate
Not only do you see a nigga shining, you can see a nigga breathe
Jewels enchanted, like they was new from Atlantis (uhh)
Cruise with the hammer, jealous hearted, can't stand him
Haters are scandalous, damn, can't a nigga just breathe? (woo!)
To all my niggas getting money in the streets (yeah)
Middle fingers up, fuck the police
Light up my trees, and I just breathe...

[Verse 1]
I twist 'em, baby mama beef victim
Chronic leaf hitting, all kinds of heat with him, wisdom
From pot to piss in to high position
Intense hustle, it's pain like a pinched muscle
'Til it rains and my Timbs stain my socks
'Til I dodge enough shots and the presiding judge slams a mallet
And says life I'ma guap, then I cop
Then I yacht, then I dock
Island hopping away from nightmare holders
Or cowboy slingers, who shoot up any club
To see they names ring loud on some FBI poster
Must be on X or they coked up
Suggesting I post a, bail, I'm like, "Yes" 'cause we soldiers
We just getting older, in time, we still in our prime
I can't afford a new arrest on my folder
Nigga, breathe...

[Chorus]
In America, you'll never be free
Middle fingers up, fuck the police
Damn, can't a nigga just breathe?
Braveheart, still QB's Finest
Grinding, enough diamonds to change the climate
Not only do you see a nigga shining, you can see a nigga breathe
Jewels enchanted like they was new from Atlantis (uhh)
Cruise with the hammer, jealous hearted, can't stand him
Haters are scandalous, damn, can't a nigga just breathe? (woo!)
To all my niggas getting money in the streets (get money)
Middle fingers up, fuck the police (fuck 'em)
Light up my trees, and I just breathe...

[Verse 2]
I'm, fresh out of city housing, ain't have too many options
Pennies on a pension or penitentiary bounded
Plenty Henny in me, envy was simply they trend, see
My enemy was every hater that was bigger than me
The high life, the fly life
Pierre Hardy, imitation of Christ
Ice-wear gaudy, since '94 flossy
The Lex was an excellent choice now fast forward me
The pestilence of the ghetto informed me
As a shorty, to push nothing less than a 740
With fresh linen, sip Pellegrinos with Airs on
They sick, mixing they water with Airborne

[Interlude]
Oh, they so sick!
Look how I got 'em going crazy, look at that!
You gotta let it out, stress, ain't good man
You gotta breathe (breathe...)
And America, we gotta be free

[Outro]
Breathe...
Breathe...
Breathe...
Breathe...

[Nas talking]
The light is there

[Intro: Olu Dara singing]
See I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive

[Verse 1: Nas]
Let's go!...
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey --
Chuck Berry of these rap skits, styles I mastered
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
But I'm still number one, everyday real
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel
Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss
Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi
Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy
Bridging the gap, from the blues, to jazz, to rap
The history of music on this track
Born in the game, discovered my father's music
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids
Some are well-known, some doin' bids
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo

[Olu Dara singing]
See I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive
Greatest man alive (Yeah, turn it up!)
Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!

[Verse 2: Nas]
The blues came from gospel, gospel from blues
Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's
Old school, new school, know school rules
All these years I been voicin' my blues
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
Books to read, like X and stuff
Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of
Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up
Cause none'a them would like my style
Read more books than the curriculum profile
Said, "Mr. Jones please come get your child
Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild"

[Olu Dara singing]
I was born in Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Moved to New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive
Greatest man - The great-greatest man alive

[Verse 3: Nas]
Hey-Hey-Hey -- My Poppa was not a Rollin' Stone
He been around the world blowin' his horn, still he came home
Then he got grown, changed his name to Olu
Come on, tell 'em 'bout the places you gone to

[Olu Dara singing]
I been to Saudi Arabia, Mozambique
Madagascar, Paris, Greece
The Middle Africa is where we lived
Better known as Queenbridge
[Nas]
Nas, Nas you don't stop
Olu Dara in the house, you don't stop
Muddy Waters' Howling Wolf you don't stop
From the Blues to Street Hop you don't stop
Tell 'em Pop

[Outro: Olu Dara singing / Nas adlibbing]
See I come from Mississippi (Let 'em know)
I was young and runnin' wild (Runnin' wild)
Ended up in New York City (Yeah!)
Where I had my first child (That's me)
I named the boy Nasir (Yeah, Daddy!)
All the boys call him Nas (Luh ya, boy)
I told him as a youngster
He'll be the greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop)
Greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop)
Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!
Rest In Peace Ray Charles

[Intro: Guy sample]
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

[Verse 1: Nas]
Bye baby, I guess you knew why I walked away
When we walked to the altar, that was an awesome day
Did counselling, couldn't force me to stay
Something happens when you say I do, we go astray
Why did we mess it up? We was friends, we had it all
Reason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault
He in the grave  let it go, he no longer living
Said you caught him cheating with mom, fucking other women
Fuck that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the newest truck
Birkin bags, we burning cash, now baby, do it up
No matter who you fuck, that was before me
Wanted you as my shorty since before I saw you screaming
"Hate you so much right now"
Should've saw the meaning, angry black woman
Actions of a demon, I'm leaving

[Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)]
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

[Verse 2: Nas]
Bye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave
Seven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed
Let's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years
You and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird
Same time, different year, I was digging y'all flow
Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know
I thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches
I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin
Yet the cuter version, yet I knew you personally
Better than you knew yourself  and I knew this for certain
Crib in the Dominican, you got away from everybody
You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably
The highlight of my life, like "Ha, yo, look at my wife!"
Gangsta, me and 20 cops 'bout to fight, crazy night
Bailed you out, next morning we got clean
Like it never happened, and later we at that Heat game
Just another day in the life of two people in love
But it wasn't enough, so baby, guess what...

[Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)]
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
OH! OH! AHHHHHHHH! Bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

[Verse 3: Nas]
Listen, could you imagine writing your deposition
Divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?
With you paying out the ass and I'm talking half
Not some, but half, no, serious, half
Half of your soul, half of your heart, you leaving behind
Its either that or die, I wanted peace of mind
And all I seen was selfish cowards
Under their breath, saying, "Why did Nas trust her?"
But look at yourself! Speak louder, bruh!
You live with your baby moms
And scared to make an honest woman out of her
And make her your bride, fake pimps, you ain't even alive
At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride
Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride
He got my nose, my grill, your color, your eyes
Next go round I hope I pick the truest type
And watch me do it all again  its a beautiful life, aight?
Goodbye!

[Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)]
(Bye baby) Baby.. baby
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
I guess you knew and blew a good thing
You know I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

[Outro: Guy sample]
'Til we make love just one more time
Make it seem forever
This is our last and final goodbye
Goodbye

[Nas]
There comes a day in your life when you wanna kick back
Straw hat on the porch when you old perhaps
Wanna gather your thoughts, have a cold one
Brag, to your grandkids on how life is golden
So I'mma light a cigar in the corridor of the crib
Pictures on the wall of all the things that I did
All the money and fame, 8 by 10's
Of the whole Rat Pack inside of a big frame
Colliding with big names that could've made your career stop
All that, and your man is still here and I'm still hot
Wow, I need a moment y'all
See I almost felt a tear drop

[Chorus]
When was the last time you heard a real anthem
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme
Never on schedule, but always on time

[Hook]
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

Ohh, I'm that history I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my life long anthem
Can't forget about you
(Can't forget about, Can't forget about you)

[Nas]
Can't forget about the old school, Bam, Caz, Melle Mel, Flash
Rocksteady spinnin on they back
Can't forget when the first rap Grammy went to Jazzy, Fresh Prince
Fat Boys broke up, rap hasn't been the same since
So irregular, how it messed you up
When Mr. T became a wrestler
Can't forget about Jordan's retirement
The shot Robert Horry hit to win the game in the finals kid
Some things are forever, some things are not
It's the things we remember that gave the world shock
They stay in a place in your mind so snug
Like who the person was with whom you first made love

[Hook]
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

Ohh, I'm that history I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my life long anthem
Can't forget about you
(Can't forget about, Can't forget about you)
Can't forget about you
(Can't forget about, Can't forget about you)

[Nas]
Unforgettable, unsubmittable, I go by N now
Just one syllable, it's the end cause the game's tired
It's the same vibe, Good Times had right after James died
That's why the gangsta rhymers ain't inspired
Heinous crimes help record sales more than creative lines
And I don't wanna keep bringing up the greater times
But I'm a dreamer nostalgic with the state of mind
The past the past enough of it, aight then
But nothing gives me chills like Douglas and Tyson
Or Mike when his talk was live
Or when he first did the moon walk on Motown 25

[Chorus]
When was the last time you heard a real anthem
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme
Never on schedule, but always on time

[Hook]
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

[Nat "King" Cole sample]
That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too



[Intro]
Yeah, niggas want to talk about this rap shit
Niggas want to talk about this money
About these cars, these homes, these labels
Clothes, sneakers, big money shit
Now everybody trying to get rich
Now get rich niggas, fuck it

[Verse 1]
Some rap pioneers be them crackheads
When they speak, you see missin' teeth
Silver chain with a silver piece
Niggas your grandfather's age, they pants still hangin' down they legs, talkin' about they ain't paid
And they hate you, cause they say you ain't pay dues
And Slyvia Robinson was stealin' and robbin' them
I feel it's a problem we gotta resolve
Hip-Hop been dead, we the reason it died
Wasn't Sylvia's fault or because MC's skills are lost
It's because we can't see ourselves as the boss
Deep-rooted through slavery, self-hatred
The Jewish stick together, friends in high places
We on some low level shit, we don't want niggas to ever win
See, everybody got a label
Everybody's a rapper, but few flow fatal
It's fucked up, it all started from two turntables

[Hook]
When they crown you and you rise up to your position
Carry on tradition
When they knight you, then you go to fight
Go to war, don't petition, carry on tradition
Carry on tradition, carry on, ca-carry on, carry on tradition
Carry On Tradition
When you rep what we rep, then carry on tradition

[Verse 2]
Some of these new rappers got their caps flipped backwards
With their fingers intertwined in some gang-sign madness
I got an exam, let's see if y'all pass it
Let's see who can quote a Daddy Kane line the fastest
Some of you new rappers, I don't understand your code
You have your man shoot you, like in that Sopranos episode
Do anythin' to get in the game, mixtapes
You spit hate against bosses; hungry fucks are moraless
You should be tossed in a pit full of unfortunate vocalists
Niggas, I could've wrote your shit
I had off-time, was bored with this
I could've made my double-LP
Just by samplin' different parts of Nautilus
Still came five on the charts with zero audience
The lane was open and y'all was droppin' that garbage shit
Y'all got awards for your bricks  it got good to ya
You started tellin' them bigger dogs to call it quits?! WHAT?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now niggas got the studio poppin', it's mad clearer
Engineers got his earplugs and still hear us
The live-in-the-park sound versus the studio state of art sound. We on the charts now
From British Walkers and Argyles
Look at us rap stars now, with our black cars now
Fortune 500 listed, brunches, sip Cipriani's
Sippin', blunted, with rich white guys around me
Thick white girls around me, Chinese lined up
Because I'm what? Every dime lust
We used to be a ghetto secret; can't make my mind up
If I want that or the whole world to peep it
Now carry on tradition
Fuck a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin'
Peace to the strugglin' artists and dead one's gone, we miss 'em.I promise I carry on tradition

[Hook]

[Hook: Amy Winehouse]
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I cant see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
Heard he was hidin' somewhere I cant see
And Im alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry
Yes, Im alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry

[Verse 1]
I want someone who like the champagne I like, my a-alike
Someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she aint afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
'Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She loves art, she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herb's natural medicine, she cookin' good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't lookin' good
For real, the world so ill, yo I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as theres no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep-rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, youre heaven-sent
Your smile put me at ease
Youre the woman I need, but where is she?

[Hook: Amy Winehouse]
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I cant see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
Heard he was hidin' somewhere I cant see
And Im alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry
Yes, Im alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry

[Verse 2]
I hate when people write me hostile texts
On account of my lifestyles perception
Invade my personal life? Out of the question
What are they expectin'? I be tryin' to reply and
They never suppose I get my quiet time in?
They think forever Im rollin' in dough, swimmin' in a pool of cash
God, wouldnt they know or am I a fool or ass?
Im well known, got people comin' at me mad
I had to tell homes, I dont keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond
Id gallivant around the equator, if that would get me off the radar
Its so intense, Im on my Lilo & Stitch
Pour my Pinot Grigio and Cris with some lime, what is this?
An immaculate version of "Me & My Bitch" by Biggie
With all respect 'cause you the only one that gets me

[Hook: Amy Winehouse]
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I cant see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
Heard he was hidin' somewhere I cant see
And Im alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry
Yes, Im alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, lets pour some cherry wine
Everythings good, everythings fine
Yeah, yeah, we bring it every time
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine
Yeah, hey yo, Salaam
Yeah, I think they know the time
Everythings good, everythings fine
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine, yeah

Life is good, life is good, yeah
Life is good, no matter what, life is good
Life is good, life is good, yeah
No matter what, life is good

[Hook: Amy Winehouse]
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I cant see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
Heard he was hidin' somewhere I cant see
And Im alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry
Yes, Im alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry







He's a kaleidoscope to look in; a black men and white women
Sometimes together make exotic looking children
But mixed race kids become fixated on separating themselves from the hatred
Your grandma on the black side make you slam the station
Your grandma on the white side was educated in schools that were segregated; maybe she was racist
Maybe you can't, today, school her on some brand new today shit
If I grew up a rich boy, like this boy, this white boy, like you boy, the Christmas toys, the privileged joys
I think I'd be less stressed, the whole family at home, the ideal address
But he's dealing with self mutilation, dungeons and dragons, Ouija boards, rituals with satan
Yeah, we grew up with similar anger

[Intro]
And as a special treat this evening
I have asked America's foremost young poet
To read his latest poem for us

[Scratching by DJ Premier]
"Ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"
"Everybody watch him"
"Ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"
"We-we-we came a long way"
"Ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"
"Everybody watch him"
"Ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"*

[Verse 1]
Yo..
Yo.. yo..
Power and crime, the thugs slinging powder and dimes
Twenties of D, is yo' niggas wilder than mine?
My niggas bust nines, puff lye and stick up cowards
For they shine, you resist, then you push up flowers
I'm like Luca Brasi, Vito's best hit-man
That's "Godfather" shit, back seat, next lit plans
Revolvers spit, I'm too tough to bargain with
And you don't want the God to pull up the cars that's sick
Arms and wrists is lit up, Queensbridge Kings
Plaques, awards, applause when I do my thing
Streets is black as midnight, the concrete gray
With stains of blood and germ and piss all day
Come on the ave, get sized up, plus appraised
Duck and pray that my guns don't bust your way
Niggas with names, living off reputation
Sometimes gotta remind you ain't nothing changing

[Scratching by DJ Premier]
"Ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"
"Everybody watch him"}

[Chorus]
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love we can take it there

[Verse 2]
You don't like me clown? Now you wanna take me down?
If I bring my face around, you gon' do what? You butt
Your crew knew I blew up, I been shining - baseball diamonds
Dick rings for your chicklings
Niggas know what my nine pearl handle's about
Fuck you say girlie mouth? Get it krunk like the Dirty South
And I know you see me flossed out, multi-milli-i
Hear your bitch talk about me, you give her the cold eye?
Girls dig you, imagine what she feel for me?
You make hot songs, but she know you steal from me
Who ill as me? I wild on haters in album three
Next level - I take y'all niggas to 3-D
Can't find a nigga shook from Queens
I'll be with the most grimy killers
(what nigga) and they all look clean
Who put bombs underneath cars, if you want beef then start
Your next stop is to the graveyard

[Chorus]
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love we can take it there

[Verse 3]
You too feminine to kill again, jail got you soft
You talk but you scared to go back up North
Keep your face twisted, but you don't really want nothing
Talk a bunch of shit motherfucker and stop fronting
You don't wanna flip again, and sell drugs again
Be on the run again, catch you at the Comfort Inn
Shoot up your door, bust in on you and your whore
Put y'all in bags, clean the blood off of the floor
So play tough, I want y'all to get out of line
I got nines, every color shape and design
I sent killers every race to put one in your spine
Two in your ear, get your crew, who do I fear?
Nobody never get involved and none of 'em dying
I think like you do, roll with about two irons
Catch me flying, high in the aircraft wining
- and dining, you die, then we laugh, you bitch-ass
The rich ass, they gauze up, your stab wounds
While I'm getting head, in a Lear jet, bathroom
With all my goons, all my ice, and suitcases
Full of paper, not money it's bank statements
The Illmatic that explains how we rock
Yachts and co-ops, we buy the hood and sell you a block

[Chorus]
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love we can take it there

[Hook: Nas] **2X**
'Come Take a Ride' you can fit up in my two-seater
Nas a thug you can catch me in my wife beater
Blowin' my drugs you know how I like the cheeba-cheeba
And if you hatin' and I prolly don't like it either

[Nas]
Fresh dressed like a million bucks
Threw on my black jeans and Timberland Chucks
I got some moneys in my pockets got some money to spend
Got some hoochies I'mma hook up wit quarter to ten
My daughter wit me and we came from the mall
Don't need no baby mama drama
Kissed her on the cheek and dropped her back off
I hit the car wash at half past four
Some kid was star struck
I pulled off my grass and let 'em puff sour
My deuce-deuce rims shinin' happy as they can be
I went to the famous Project that they call QB
I saw some brothers gamblin' on the curb
A shorty pulled a pistol took they paper, nigga that's my word
I turned the corner wit my burner and palm
Niggas know my name and game I'm a murderous Don
Saw my peoples then extended my arm
Pulled on the sidewalk, no time to talk
If y'all comin' come on; come on!

[Hook: Nas] **2X**

[Nas]
Talk like a champion, walk like a champion
Body like a God and I promise that Nas'll a hit you off
Flow like a gangsta, brum bum bum bum bum
Bustin' black dummies and dustin' all y'all niggas off
I've been around a couple of times, know how things go
I dealt wit 'em all on different occasion
The same things'll come in different stages
So when them things rise up or pop up
I look right past as if its weightless
Meanin' it won't intervene the thought process
So I can levitate to more important topics
Laughin' the Face of Death, flash back of car crashes
20 L's Grey Goose vodka and tall glasses
Dippin' in the twilight
Wit gangsta smokin' weed in my ride light
The same stuff is still a bitch livin' like I'm rich
Bang broads call me Mr. International, ghetto stars come on

[Hook: Nas] **2X**

[Nas]
Slow like I robbed Brinks truck, haters all fold
Cuz my 9 is aimed up, I left four seasons
My niggas bleedin' cause of four reasons
Jealousy, hate, laziness and envy even
Up in the Benzie squeezin' a couple Henny wit my comrad
Conversatin' on what we believe in
Like honey in the way she's been cause he's spend
G's a week in the make freak knees bend
I told her to pimp hard, see the hoes we left in the room
They nymphomaniacs prolly lick homegirls womb
As respect just phone 'em and leave 'em & shit
They not your wife keep your cash nigga don't even trip
Pass the grass accordingly, you saw police
But when I puffed and coughed
Seconds later screamin' "Fuck the Law"
Got CD's, TV's, guns tucked in the floor
Once again I hit the streets and y'all don't see no more
So uh...

[Hook: Nas] **5X**



Nas: "This ain't for everybody. Y'all know who y'all are
Yeah you, y'all know who y'all are. These are our
Heroes."

[Hook: Nas]
Let's hear it, one for the coons on UPN 9 and WB
Who 'Yes Massa' on TV, what ever happened to Wheezy? The Red Fox's?
Never got Emmy's but were real to me
Let's hear it, two for the spooks who do cartwheels
Cause they said they played they parts well
Now they claim caviar, hate that oxtail
Lambda Sigma Phi badge on lapel
Whitey always tell him, "Ooh, he speak so well"
Are you the one we look to, the decent Negro?
The acceptable Negro -- hell nah
But they say, "These are our heroes"

[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh, Massa used to breed us to be bigger to go play
Athletes of today in the NBA, make me proud
But there's somethin' they don't say
Keep gettin' accused for abusin' White pussay
From OJ to Kobe, uh let's call him Tobe
First he played his life cool just like Michael
Now he rock ice too just like I do
Yo, you can't do better than that?
The hotel clerk who adjusts the bathroom mat?
Now you lose sponsorships that you thought had your back
Yeah, you beat the rap jiggaboo, fake nigga you
You turn around then you shit on Shaq
Who woulda knew, Mr. Goodie-Two-Shoes
He love a little butt crack, got enough cash
Little kids with they bus pass who look up to you
To do something for the youth, stupid spoof
But you let them use you as an example
They would rep, but our heroes got they hands full

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nas]
You Homey The Clown, bowtie, apple pie, Bo Jangles
But we love Bo Jangles, we know what he came through
But what's your excuse, dude? You talk Black
But your album sound like you give your nuts for a plaque
You don't ride for the facts like um, say Scarface
You don't know what you feel, y'all too safe
Election done came and went, y'all worked so hard for it
Huh, and in the end we all got dicked
These are our heroes, thanks a lot public school systems still rot
Still harassed by cops, snitches on blocks
Sellin they peoples out - some real folks with clout
Tavis Smiley, Michael Eric Dyson
Stokely Carmichael, let's try to be like them
Nicky Giovanni poetical black female
Jim Brown to the people who sing well from
Fela to Miriam Makeba
The mirror says you are the next American leader
So don't be, acceptin new 'We are the World' records
These pickaninnies get with anything to sell records
Cause it's trendy to be the conscious MC
But next year, who knows what we'll see?
Ha-Ha, these are our heroes

[Hook]

[Nas:] "Yeah, I wanna give a special shoutout to the -- y'know
The crew doin' they thing out there reppin' us hard
Big up to Tiger Woods. Yeah, ya don't stop. Big up
To Cuba Gooding Jr. Y'know, yeah, y'know. Tay Diggs
What up my nigga. Yeah, ha-ha. And you don't quit
And ya don't quit, and ya don't stop and ya don't quit."

[Male Heckler:] "Yeah-Yeah, what you doin' for the hood though
Homie? What you doin' for the hood, man? Look at
All that paper. Drivin' around like a playboy in
My hood. What type of shit is that?"

[Overlapping dialogue]

[Nas:] "I'm outta here. Please, excuse me, 'xcuse me -- please
Let me get to my limousine, I'm outta here. I know, I
Got a plane to catch. And I love you back. Ha-Ha
Yeah yeah -- And I'm outta here. A-ha-ha -- PEACE."

[Thug Heckler:] "Come on man, give back to the hood. Cocky
Motherfucker!"



[Hook: Nas sample & Jay-Z sample]
Cops keep firing, in my environment
Middle finger to the law, nigga, gripping my balls
Cops keep firing, in my environment
Middle finger to the law, nigga, gripping my balls
(Green Lantern!)
Cops keep firing, in my environment
Middle finger to the law, nigga, gripping my balls
Id like to see them fall, guilty for doing raw
Middle finger to the law, nigga, gripping my balls

[Verse 1: Nas]
Now all you hypocrites, witness the injustice
Conversations taped illegally, then they cuff us
U.S. attorneys, public defenders send us off to hard prison time
Whether you innocent or did the crime
Say you come from Hooters, cops pursue you hard
Run your place, put guns in your face
Put you in the car for nothing (Green Lantern!)
Now you struggling, tied up, standing in line-ups
Call your lawyer, they charge you for murder
Why? Cause these liars
Say you shot another man in his driveway
Guilty, just for being Black on a Friday
Polygraph test, youre failing, because youre nervous
Charged with murder you didnt commit, then they serve ya
Fifteen years, maximum security
Slashing, stab wounds, broken bone, injuries
You were placed there intentionally
Either you bang or you miss me
Listen to me, this is true!

[Hook: Nas sample & Jay-Z sample]
Cops keep firing, in my environment
Middle finger to the law, nigga, gripping my balls
Cops keep firing, in my environment
Middle finger to the law, nigga, gripping my balls
Cops keep firing, in my environment
Middle finger to the law, nigga, gripping my balls
Id like to see them fall, guilty for doing raw
Middle finger to the law, nigga, gripping my balls

[Verse 2: Nas]
Death sentences is cold as see-your-own-breath temperatures (Invasion!)
When your old life and the ten-point program didnt mix
Panthers, founded October 66
Next year, police arrest the Minister of Defense
Newton, for shooting and killing a pig in Oakland
Free Huey, the skys the limit! became the slogan
Jail bars open, then Huey told em:
Let my brothers free with me and slam the jail bars closed then
I go then to say today, Where are those men?
Slaughtered by COINTELPRO and coke, and
Heroin, this era we in, we think we chilling
In our Harry Winston, in our high-priced clothing
Some of these P.D.s is tired of us
They got they orders from they higher-ups to line us up
From age and up, then they fire on us
The inconvenient truth got them lying to us
The Evil Genius!

[Hook: Nas sample & Jay-Z sample]
Cops keep firing, in my environment
Middle finger to the law, nigga, gripping my balls
Cops keep firing, in my environment
Middle finger to the law, nigga, gripping my balls
Cops keep firing, in my environment
Middle finger to the law, nigga, gripping my balls
Id like to see them fall, guilty for doing raw
Middle finger to the law, nigga, gripping my balls

[Outro: Nas & Paul Mooney sample]
You still wanna be a nigga too?
White folks shouldntve made up nigga, I didnt make it up. Its too bad. I say nigga a hundred times every morning. It makes my teeth white. Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga. I aint scared of that word



[Intro: Richard Pryor]
The cops used to come around in my neighborhood
"Alright, you kids, stop having so much fun, move along!"
Oh they'd arrest me, you know, especially at night
They had a curfew, niggas had to be home at 11, negros, 12
And you'd be trying to get home, doing your crew runs
And they'd always catch you out in front of a store or something
'Cause you'd be taking shortcuts, right
Cops, "Ree, put your hands up, black boy!"

[Chorus: Slick Rick]
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot
The cops shot the kid

[Verse 1: Nas]
I don't wanna hurt nobody
We just came here to party
See a few dames, exchange some names
I'm a top shotta, kid, stay in your lane
The cop shot the kid, same old scene
Pour out a little liquor, champagne for pain
Slap-boxin' in the street
Crack the hydrant in the heat
Cop cars on the creep
Doin' they round-ups, we just watch for the sweep
Yeah, it's hotter than July
It's the summer when niggas die
It's the summer when niggas ride
Together we'll be strong, but forever we divide
So y'all are blowin' my high
Type of shit that's killin' my vibe
White kids are brought in alive
Black kids get hit with like five
Get scared, you panic, you're goin' down
The disadvantages of the brown
How in the hell the parents gon' bury their own kids
Not the other way around?
Reminds me of Emmett Till
Let's remind 'em why Kap kneels

[Chorus: Slick Rick]
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot
The cops shot the kid
I still hear him scream

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Stay tuned up and down your timeline
This fake news, people is all lyin'
Money is bein' made when a mom cries
Won't be satisfied 'til we all die
Tell me, who do we call to report crime
If 9-1-1 doin' the driveby?
It's certain things I can't abide by
I ain't bein' extreme, this is my side
Talkin' big shit, ready to die
I know every story got two sides
Claimin' he paranoid by the black guy
Cop wanna make it home by nighttime
Just a good kid, he wasn't that guy
Had a little hit, he wasn't that high
Cop gon' claim that it was self-defense
Say he was ridin' dirty so the case rests

[Chorus: Slick Rick & Kanye West]
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot (workin' nine-to-five)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot (tryna stay alive)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot (makin' ends meet)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot (shot him this week)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot
The cops shot the kid
I still hear him scream

[Intro]
Order in court, order in the court
No one else but Mr. Jones has the right to be speaking right now
Order in the court or Im gonna start making some arresting here
You dont belong in the court house anyway, your rap concert has been canceled
Order in my court, 

[Verse 1: Nas]
I wake up, wake up in the morning shake my third leg in the toilet
Uzi on my night stand, Im the man you go to war with
Not the man you go to war against,
Patience I get you if that means I cant sleep a whole year
I get you, I'm official not a tisket, a tasket
I put you in the casket with a biscuit
The ratchet, the smoke a biscuit, the planted trees advanced weed
Doomed forsakers you fucking fake bloods like movie makeup
I flow tight as tootie bracers, who he hating us
Ill be on the state bus, shackles is my eight bus
Cause y'all some tellers, opposite of bankers
Im the shit for ages, my clip steel wheel  gangsters
Click still move like free masons, so were from on the flow from the law
Cause large is all across the nation, Nas is bread for the plan
The hold the grand dragon head in his hand
Come and get me, here I am
Pokem, pokem

[Hook]
Im not a law prayer, so you could tell your mayor
Im a non-stop driven by poetry slayer
One, two, three, down for the count
The result my lyrics oh yes, no doubt (X2)
Pokem, pokem

[Verse 2: Chuck D]
The good man in me gets money and stay on the path
But the Pimp shit in me says yo, keep looking for ass
My daughter gave me a gift, something to hold
A little city in water, when you shake it, it snows
I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes
Better wait till
Youre grown, when in love you will know
Everybodys gotta dream I hope to wish to own a six times two
 against who I dont know
So one who fed you wont blow, you wont eat, you wont cake
Pay mistake, blaming me for their failures I'm fresh
Getting tale single breasted
A lip brush is sense less some pimp shit
A women hates a man and stays with him for many years
Tell him she loves him and be jealous of him
Now lame is how the ghetto judge him, cause hes still with her
She take his cash give it to some other real nigga, like me
Pokem, pokem, pokem

[Intro Repeated]



[Intro]
One more time, one more time
Uh, one more time
Uh, one more time

[Verse 1]
I dream of the day I can go back to when I was born
Layin' in your arms, wishin' you was here today, Mom
Wish you'd appear, just for a second from Heaven
My tears would be gone, I wouldn't be rappin' this song
I'd be happy drivin' up to your eight-bedroom mansion
Up late, laughin' about the hard times we faced
The galaxy is so enchantin' beyond, Galileo's understandin'
Past the Milky Way and all the planets
There's somethin' out there greater, but only God knows
Scientists claim we came from apes, but they lies though
That was part of our conversation
I spark one up and start blazin'
Thinkin' of how amazin' she was, an angel gave me love
I'm thankful to ever know a woman so real
I pray, when I marry, my wife'll have one of your skills
But Mom, you could never be replaced
I'd give my life up just to see you one more day, to have

[Chorus]
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma
Praying, wishing that I could have
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma

[Verse 2]
I wish you were here, I miss you more each second I breathe
You resting in peace, forever, I accepted you free
A blessing to me, I see you dressed in all white
Smilin' at me, happy, knowin' everything's all right
If only I could hear your voice and your laughter
Just one more time, my chest would be filled up with sunshine
April 7th '02, that's when the gates of Heaven opened up
For you to stroll through, beautiful Anne Jones
Job is done, raising ghetto kids in the hood
You was my strength to carry on, and now I'm good
Job well done, you lived through your sons and grandchildren
Jesus finally got his bride, Mommy, dance with him!
And you've been my guide through all the trouble I faced
They playin' our song, the life-beat, my hand on your waist
I grab your other hand, I'm tryin' not to step on your toes
Spin you around with my eyes closed, dreaming I can have

[Chorus]
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma
Praying, wishing that I could have
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma

[Outro]
I love you forever, Mom
You will always live through me, always
Uh, uh, uh, yeah

[Intro]
Check it out
I call it, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters

[Verse 1]
I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up, first I regretted it, then caught my rage
Like, how could I not protect her from this awful phase?
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised
Like a princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switchin' women, Pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster, can't be mad, I'll love him
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail  dead that
Wait 'til he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your Mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You seventeen, I got a problem with it
She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure
But she rockin' with it

[Hook]
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important

[Verse 2]
This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig
This social network said: "Nas, go and get your kid!"
She's on Twitter, I know she ain't gon' post no pic
Of herself underdressed  no inappropriate shit, right?
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser, then she Instagram'd it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Should've drove more time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they're too nurture teen talents
They grow fast, one day she's your little princess
Next day she's talkin' boy business  what is this?
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls

[Hook]
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important

[Verse 3]
And I ain't tryin' to mess your thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons
How fathers feel for they daughters
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
When she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed-off
Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters
Love







[Intro]
To my niggas
To my niggas
What! What!

[Verse 1]
Looking back in time, when I had on my shine
I saw you standing there
I never tried to diss you, you didn't need your pistol
Why did you have to take it there
But then again, it was just my imagination
When my crew told me it was you that was player hating
Then we had to have that terrible confrontation
There's nothing I can do to help this situation...

[Hook]
Stay scheming (ya niggas kill me)
Niggas wanna get at me
Stay scheming
Niggas wanna get at me

[Verse 2]
Its been awhile since the last time we hung out
Full of weed, drinking henny until we all passed out
Stretch bently, Queens clique, pushing mean whips
And ho I'm with, glad who see she with
Shorty with the don
Me and horse switch cars
Jazz ruff for the six, this is it par
Thug nigga never thought I get this far
Who is that icing me from over there in the fog?
You got the mack god, you got the gat par
Dam, why they gotta do it to the black god
Everytime we chilling niggas want to act hard
My nigga Jungle known to slap a nigga back-ward
So we chill pay no mind, think about about shit
I'm for the love of it
Stubborn niggas always plotting on the brother tip
Can't even chill cause niggas just

[Hook]
Stay scheming
Niggas wanna get at me
Stay scheming
Niggas wanna kidnap me

[Outro]
But they never do it motherfuckers...



[Hook]
I know all of y'all hear me, none of y'all scare me
Cause niggas die daily
Coming out with my guns real early
Laying in your stairway, cause niggas die daily
So I got niggas around you
Mad like they're back for their man
You've killed just a year ago today
So call it a death anniversary
Rushing to emergency, niggas die daily

[Nas]
What if I told you that AZ didn't exist
And I put him there, played it like a ventriloquist
Cause niggas spit fake shit and y'all respect it
I spit that real shit and y'all won't buy the record
What if me and the rapper homey was really cool
And we used that whole thing as a media tool
Would you say I was a sucka or say I was savvy
If I told you mothafucka's that me and K wasn't married?
What if Jungle wrote my shit and I'm really illiterate
And the whole Nas catalog was just an experiment
What if I really died when Ill Will got shot
This is Will rhyming right now while Nas is chilling with 'Pac
What If I did all the advertisements thrown my way
And I've boned every chick that would throw me some play
I'd have to load another AK cause niggas be jealous
Cause we real like them Brazil favelas

[Hook]

[Nas]
Scream at the nigga "breathe don't breathe your last breath"
But you know a nigga dead when he pee on himself
Blatter giving up on 'em, face start to puff on 'em
Bloating up, nigga cold as fuck, trying hold on 'em
Loosen up the nine out of his fingers
Angels coming only he can hear the psalms that they're singing
And it hurts me, the planets cursed, B
This your niggas first year anniversary
This how it goes down in every ghetto
So it's quite natural for rappers to settle
And make pop music, nursery hooks
Cause back then we thought the only thing that worked was the jooks
They're tryna pimp a game that done pimped them first
I'm pimping the industry so they acknowledge our worth
The next anniversary we all unite
Let's all get together or we're loosing the fight

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
Through the lights, cameras, and action, glamour, glitters, and gold
I unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
When I'm deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast
To conquer peace leaving savages to roam in the streets
Live on the run, police paying me to give in my gun
Trick my wisdom with the system that imprisoned my son
Smoke a gold leaf, I hold heat, nonchalantly
I'm raunchy, but things I do is real it never haunts me
While, funny style niggas roll in the pile
Rooster heads profile on a bus to Rikers Isle
Holdin weed inside they pussy with they minds on the pretty things in life
Gettin' props is a true thug's wife
It's like a cycle, niggas come home, some'll go in
Do a bullet, come back and do the same shit again
From the womb to the tomb, I presume the unpredictable
Gun salute life rapidly, that's the ritual

[Hook]
Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women
(Dj Vu)
It's like a whole new beginning...
Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women
(Dj Vu)
It's like a whole new beginning...
Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women
(Dj Vu)
It's like a whole new beginning...
Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women
(Dj Vu)
It's like a whole new beginning...

[Verse 2]
Blunts, thugs and alcohol, what a mixture
Just picture, ya life as a whole judged in court they convict ya
They telling you your state of mind, like you worthless
So he curses, his mom saying Bible verses
That's all she works with
But miracles never leave the churches
Instead, it hits the pockets of the Preacher just to purchase
A house, with a swimming pool, labels me a sinning fool
I'm just a nigga who inherited a winning jewel
To be a trendsetter, whenever subject to
Respect this and all respect due is the essential
To street life, hustlin, the struggle, broke ghettos
Boiling coke settles slow inside a glass kettle
Darren Levy on my TV, lifestyles of living easy
Got my crew tense, plottin to jips, to get whips with BBs
Pushing cakes, knew anorexics with ten plates
Celebrating elevation in the seeds that we make
So How You Like That?

[Hook]
Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women
(Dj Vu)
It's like a whole new beginning...
Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women
(Dj Vu)
It's like a whole new beginning...
Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women
(Dj Vu)
It's like a whole new beginning...
Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women
(Dj Vu)
It's like a whole new beginning...

[Verse 3]
Escobar life, gems and raw Timbs
Gators for pretty boy haters
In Vegas with chicks trickin fortunes
I'm glistening, housing cops whistling
Still I'm drifting in a high, blunts is like insulin
95-I, I drive high, zoning
Stash box zone in my trunk, I flash not, teeth golden
Look at me now, Ma
Blowin but for how far?
Cars, cash, and bitches got me out more
And things you never dreamed I can vouch for
Snake niggas slither on the A-alikes
I ain't a Christian, but I find that we pray alike
Never the one to ask for the time to a saint
A mask and nine, I think, will make my problems sink
Down a canal, similar to how we drink
Distinct diamond-flooded Sphinx shines on my links
Drug money, snortin bitches, in the end of times
Got my nine, 'til I flatline, nigga, give me mine

Dj vu....



Yo this Nas niggas whuttup?
QB Album coming, niggas ill Will, Bravehearts
My nigga DJ Clue - put this shit on these niggas
Desert Storm baby 2000!

A Drug dealers dream - flip his last Ki, get out the game
Cause entertainment money now is off the chain
I put blunts in niggas caskets, lost in the game
I learned about pain, bodies burnt in drug game
But I'm never gon' die, I never heard of death
Energy could never be destroyed, only the flesh
So when you niggas try to murder me with bullets to my head
This is why you can't kill me niggas I'm already dead, BRING IT!
I'm busting, bodies fall in the cemetery
Black blood raining on the street
All you niggas, buried y'all!
Niggas just came home, fresh out the state greens
Five time felon, thinking he jelling in Queens
It's pitiful - what a bid could do, especially federal
Y'all young thugs wilding, see prison
Got a bed for you waiting, I clapped that Satan
But thought I was dreaming
I woke up masturbating in the bed with demons
I cried with every bit of strength of my small body
This is the life I chose, under God I'm tiny
Hard to find me, I popped up, lock shot-up
You can't B.I., see I'm eternal, not luck
You get shot-up, boxed-up next for the grave
Your flow is one dimensional, your level is 2nd grade
You on top - WHAT?
Copying fuck, I said it first, you repeated
Your false crown covered in dirt - defeated
Y'all niggas all hail, the King is dead
He running like a bitch with his tail between his legs
Still-matic, still eye 4 an eye, wannabe God
You're just the next rapper to die, fucking with Nas



[Intro]
This is a journey into the world's most largest and notorious projects: Queensbridge
Listen while Nas saves his hood from the most cowardest rappers

[Verse 1]
He held a mass appeal and a likkle boy smile
Depressed has a complex his mouth was foul
You need to stay around I feel like tellin' some stories
First there's this arrogant fuck, his name's Cory
Hung around my man's Lakey and Big Trevor
Trevor's still locked up, Lake's gettin' his cheddar
Corey changed his name to ahh, whatever
Cornchip, Buckwheat look-a-like, it's Mega
Right, Mega was his name, sorry about that
(But it's so hard) to put a coward's name in my rap
Always actin' tough, a jokester be frontin'
He got snuffed, he got shot in the thigh, he did nothin'
But that's Nas always lookin' out for bredren
Cause when bredren don't return love it don't stress him
Cause gangstas do gangsta shit, real recognize real
Still laughin' to the bank and shit
Back to Cor', got him a deal but his rhymes was wack
Def Jam mad that he signed the contract
Now he got jealous and mad at my shine
Making silly tapes, I'm always on his mind
Nonsense, not to be obnoxious kid
Mega for the record you could suck my dick
Bitch, you from around the way it's sad what this do to me
But Queensbridge, we gotta have unity

[Refrain]
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So they say

[Verse 2]
Since we on the subject of traitors and flunkies
Mega ain't the only faggot in my hood, dummies
There's plenty that wanna be me but cannot
Its like King Arthur and Knight Sir Lancelot
Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul
Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog
Through the ups and downs, robberies and all
Though I always knew he wanted my downfall
He would say his little slick shit and act real funny
For what, nigga? You're butt and it got back to me
Askin' a Braveheart to get back your jewelry
You ain't from my hood, don't even rep Q.B
Nature moved to Marcy
(Man dick riding Nature) nothing else to say
Man Nature moved to Marcy (far.. far away)
(Backward ass niggas, man fuck them niggas
Go head with the program man proceed)
Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief
Of course we ain't friends, you never stood on no blocks
Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas
Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood anger
Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot
And get filthy rich, its just not
No more morals, no loyalty, no more community
Queensbridge, we gotta have unity

[Refrain]
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So they say

[Verse 3]
I put the name on the map after Marley and Shan
Q.B. before the ROC had one jam
Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef
Had streets locked with raw talent, I laugh at the weak
So this about cleanin' up house, my own backyard
Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed
P, how many times ain't you shamed that
Jungle was bustin' his gun to get your weak chain back
They don't respect you a cheque's due for me for your fame
Mega I hope you blow so I'm sayin' your name (Mega, Mega)
Hoes play your position 'cause you'll never be King
Even Jigga want the crown: "How that sound?" Poor thing!
I'm representin' Queensbridge U.S.A
Where two SK's go off every day ruthless-lay
All you little roaches and rats
Besides my man Ricky, Nas the true ruler is back
So haters say

[Refrain]
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So they say

[Outro]
"The Bridge is over," my dick!
The Bridge'll never be over, long as I'm alive and breathin'!
Braveheart to the graveyard! I'm the William Wallace of this shit
Ayo P, Prodigy I got love for you man, I love you man
You know what I'm sayin'?
Just get them unloyal niggas from out your circle!
You can't save everybody!
Niggas invited you to the hood - rep it right my nigga!
Be untouchable, my nigga
So it be Mobb for life for real, and that's real!
Ayo Nature, I can't hold your hand through this shit man!
I'm not your father, man!
Be your own man, stand on your own two!
I believe in you, believe in yourself, nigga
Or dont even rep this, man!
Ayo Mega you wanna be a gangsta?
There's real gangsta shit going on in the streets man!
Yo niggas is in the grind! Where you be at man?
Niggas be buckin'!
Why you never buckin'? Where you be at, man?
All of a sudden you the motherfuckin' Nino Brown of the fuckin' hood?
It's disgusting, man! Stay out the magazines!
Keep my name out your motherfuckin' mouth!
There's no more room for jealousy, we destroyin' and rebuildin':
That means the cowards get out, and real niggas stay!
Niggas been hating me since I been nine
Shining with suede motherfucking Bally's on and silks
I'ma always be the young don
Don't be like the niggas on the other side:
Hating me cause I'm beautiful!
Real niggas in Queensbridge:
You niggas come up and get this money and move on baby!
Q.B

Nas "Two-thousand-four, yeah. L, whattup?"
L.E.S. "Prophesy!"

[Verse 1: Nas]
Word to mama, any lineup of rhymers
Could bring any drama, anytime, the city's mine, Nas Is Like
Love Undying, Money's My Bitch in Thugz Mansion
Thugs dancin' around the fly shit
Pharaoh garment's Prada, Egyptian camelback-riders
Pyramid architects, Perignon bottles
Money, jewelry want me then come get me
Hit me but don't miss me, you history
Lead flowin' around like a Frisbee, Italian dons from Sicily kiss me
This ain't 50, this ain't Jigga, this ain't Diddy, this ain't Pretty
Pain, power, pussy and pistols, lyrically no one, hold none near me, hear me
Kids cheer me like The Count of Monte-Cristo
Steady poundin' soundin' like G without the lisp though
My big bro told me plain and simple, "Nas do not look back"
Watch where you took rap, no bookbags and trucker hats
Just army jacks and diamonds that's flashin'
What the fuck is that, freestyle

[Verse 2: Nas]
Like Paul, Michael and Matthew, Peter, James and Andrew
Phillip, Simon and Judas -- I'm disciple of music
Street beats is the main thing minus the traitor
And I'm not a dictator, I'm the righteous invitin' you haters
Inside the life of the greatest, it'll take you through something real
Get a smack in your face, cause I hurt up, trauma-tize, llama
Bust shells, destroy yet try'ta prevent violence
If I present iron somebody dyin', don't even worry 'bout it
Then dress warm for the cemetery climate
When I speak I need cemetery silence, terror
See me, gold Hummers, Lamborghinis, man who stole the summer
Hand straight gleamin', if I don't know you toe-tag you
Drag you through the cement, fo-fo maggie
Body parts in my man's Maserati car, then party hard in Madagascar
While rigor mortis'll grab ya, him retarded, I'm pass that
Gloves on, where the mask at? Too many love songs
All the thugs gone, what happened? Where's the passion?
Rappers battlin' non-rappers, carryin' on backwards
Laughin' sayin' Nas thinks he's Farrakhan preachin' blackness
Hell yeah, awareness is my alias
Word to the 'Braveheart' written on my bare chest
The realest, HERE IT IS!

[Hook: Nas & L.E.S.]

[Intro]
Hope y'all make it through the storm
You know what though, I love the rain man
A lot of you cats are runnin' your mouths (hahaha)
Your runnin' your mouths crazy
Think y'all got to ease up though, you know
Ease up 'fore somethin' happen man
We don't want that, at least you don't
Be easy man, tell you how it feels to be on top of the world
But y'all niggas better take it slow
Don't body ya self
Don't body ya self
Yeah, don't body ya self nigga

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
Everybody get low niggas
Dedicated to the fuck Nas coalition
Touch my dough, I'm lettin' .40 cals blow, nigga
Not cows with four legs
But cals with more lead
That add up more dead
It's on nigga, I'ma bury 'em
Niggas don't want beef they vegetarian
Scared of pussy you climbed out a caesarean (woo!)
I push ya grown ass back in your mother's womb
You need 9 more months
Your crews 9 more punks
You rhyme on stuff and claim I ain't sign y'all up
If I sign y'all I'm on dust
Yeah we from the same hood but nigga WHAT?!
When y'all was tryna rap y'all was makin' me proud
Man now you fucked up down on your luck, runnin' your mouth man
Why don't be a real man, say you need a little help
And I might help your ass off the shelf
But no, you're bein' disrespectful
Thinkin' son so cool that he won't check you
Stand down, the king is home
Queens' own, NASDAQ, Dow Jones

[Break]
Don't body ya self
Crazy
Take it slow man
Slow down (yeah)
Take it slow motherfucker
Don't body ya self
Let's listen
Let's just listen
Don't body ya self
Listen
Slow down though man
Slow down
Y'all gotta take it slow

[Verse 2]
I am De Niro after Am.Ex. commercials and The Fockers
With Martin Scorsese after Gangs of New York could rock this
Back together with the master plan
The rebirth of Langston Hughes, I'm that man
I'm in the streets like old graffiti
I'm hearin' wankstas talkin' greasy
Whether broke or rich my friend
Nasir bring that career to an end
And I'm bored with you MCs B
Y'all beneath me
And my raps bring horror like a board of Ouija
Of course I'm the king, get my shine on
And I blind y'all 'cause they call me The Lord of the Rings
Pinky heavy man, big stones in the wedding ban'
Smell of brimstone back from Hell again
Next verse gets worse from God's son to Devil sent

[Break]
Y'all need to take it slow
Don't body ya self
Motherfucker act like ya know ('05)
Motherfucker better take it slow
Don't body ya self

[Verse 3]
They say Jada defeated him
Joe too street for him
What's next? I guess it's for Nas to Ether him
Y'all awaiting an MC burial
This is ethereal, FM stereo to XM radio
What does it mean, ethereal? Hmm.. either heavenly or spiritual
Extreme, delicately light in a way that seems too perfect for this world
Man that is righteous, faithful and keeps law
Will surely live declares the sovereign Lord
And you are none of the above
So you a sucka for death, if I'm a sucka for love
And y'all wanna know why I don't gotta answer niggas
'Cause I truly understand these niggas
Scared of me so they talk about family members
Like I can't point out your grandma to niggas
Damn you was my man like crew, dog
Don't make me change your body frame to blue fog
The Q is the borough of true Dons
Any disrespect nigga we choose arms
Will it be Gilmore or Crowe's?
Nigga act like ya know

[Outro]
Yeah
Y'all better take it slow
Motherfucker act like ya know
Mess around and body ya self man
Don't body ya self



[Verse 1: Nas]
It's the late night greasy spoon patron
Poolhall making
Big bets, midsection got the 8 in
Dior Christian pimpin'
Got that penal system diction
Riffing, you don't want it you snitchin'
Spit a few at a traitor with that new AR
Try to kill me I'm the leader, that's coup d'etat
Streetsweepers in that Coup all black
Bitches want my chipped tooth back
Steel mac, so my kufi never gets smacked
Squeeze a fifth with a grip as I dip
From the paparazzi
Still playing numbers you can't stop me
Still wearing bundles, and spark weed
If I ever say "Queens get 'em", you know they got me
Success, scandal, bone deep, personal beef
So lead by example, or get trampled
Since Hip Hop Is Dead, this is the N
Congratulations in order 'cause we did it again

[Hook: Nas]
Don't hate me now, congratulate me now
I'm still getting it and don't even love the doe
Don't hate me now, congratulate me now
I'm still ripping, and I don't even love the hoes
Still getting it and don't even love the doe
Steel gripping it, you know that I tug the fo'
Stay splifted 'cause you know that I love the dro

[Verse 2: Nas]
The style is taboo, the chain's offensive
Brain on airplanes, Gucci frames are vintage
The two Tec Don in Yukon's and Benzes
Chicks who suck other chicks tits like infants (wow)
The Apprentice but not Trump
I'm the nigga with Glocks and pumps
That you don't see much
Sucker free from chumps
Homes with cobblestones in front of 'em
He's got guns in cummerbunds, so understand you under son
Don't make me have you running from a hundred guns
Don't make me grab your only son
I'm coming from
A place Tanqueray and weed's the only escape
From phonies who hate
When you rolling with papes
That's why the god party with juicy models
They mob me, Denali, Charlie Luciano - hardly
Have to tell y'all, I kill y'all
For spitting songs that involve me nigga
Original verbal assassin, have to carve me a nigga

[Hook: Nas]
Don't hate me now, congratulate me now
I'm still getting it and don't even love the doe
Don't hate me now, congratulate me now
I'm still ripping, and I don't even love the hoes
Still getting it and don't even love the doe
Steel gripping it, you know that I tug the fo'
Stay splifted 'cause you know that I love the dro

[Verse 1]
Pushin' drop-tops, Stacy Lattisaw tapes, the 80's had us all apes
Youngest gorillas up to bat at home plate
That was a uncanny era, guns in my pants, yeah
X-Clan hair, with dreads at the top of my fade
Homicidal feds on the blocks where I played b-ball
That's when I wondered was I here for the cause or because
'Cause Ray Charles could see the ghetto
Was told to stay strong and I could beat the devil
'Cause yo, I used to play Apollo balcony seats
Watchin' niggas swing razors in the front row
Then out in the streets, the car show, 560's, chemical Afros
Acuras pumpin' Super Lover Cee and Casanova
Live chicks be asses bustin' out of they clothes
Wearin' lip gloss, big door knockers peelin' they earlobes
So where them years go?
Where the Old Gold beers and cheers go?
But now them shorties here though, so

[Chorus]
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers still drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride, right?

[Verse 2]
Political thugs in shark suits persuade us to pull triggers
In army boots, yellin', "Join the armed forces!"
We lost the Vietnam War, intoxicated poisons
Needles in arms of veterans instead of bigger fortunes
There's still a lot of nigga crawlin' in the corporate offices
War in the ghetto, we crabs in a barrel, they torture us
They won't be servin' the beast too long
The murderers wearin' police uniforms, Confederate flags I burn
Beat Street breakers were dancin' to the music I chose
And Peachtree, Atlanta crackheads was tootin' they nose
In frozen corners of Chicago
Loaded-up llamas, children with fo'-fo's and double-revolvers
We devil incarnates headed for jail
Where Shell gas company in South Africa be havin' us killed
Your paper money was the death of Christ
And all these shorties comin' up just resurrect your life
It's like a cycle

[Chorus]
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers still drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride, right?

[Verse 3]
Niggas used to wear rags on they hair when it was fried up
That's when we were lied to, buyin' hair products
Back before my generation, when our blackness started disintegratin' till awareness started penetratin'
The styles come from prison, they used potatoes makin' liquor
Just to prove we some creative niggas
Turnin' nothin' into somethin' is God work
And you get nothin' without struggle and hard work
War is necessary to my niggas in chains
From Green to Sing-Sing I'm wantin' y'all to know one thing
The hardest thing is to forgive, but God does
Even if you murdered or robbed, yeah it's wrong, but God loves
Take one step toward him, He takes two toward you
Even when all else fail, God support you
I done it, got "God's Son" on my stomach
My heart and my lungs was affected
From Henny's and gettin' blunted
Do your body right and it loves you back
You only get one life, and yo, because of that
I'm still blazin', goin' out for the cause
Still rockin' stockin' caps, not for the waves, obeyin' no laws
And it's like that

[Chorus]
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers still drinkin', or puffin' they herb
And I'm still enjoyin' life's ride, right?



[Verse]
Hell yeah
Check it check it check, check check
Yo, when it come to sex advice, I'm the one to call
If you a virgin with blue balls or you tear down walls
Not Dr. Ruth, call me Dr. Knockboot
Pimped out hats, rock fashionable suits
A class for the youth, Sex Ed for your head
The do's and don'ts, that should happen in the bed
First, DON'T: run up in her raw cause you get burned
For sure, fuckin' with the typical whore, because
DO: rock a Rough Ryder, whenever you inside her
Your local bodega is your supplier
And DON'T: take the pussy, if she fightin'
Cause you saw what happened to 2Pac and Mike Tyson
'Specially if you large, some hoes is trife
Get you on a rape charge, have you servin' your life
Yo, DO: get a yes confirmation before penetration
You wind up in a police station
DON'T: get with no young bitch and hit it
She PG-13, you rated R, she not permitted
DO: check for ID, whenever chillin' V.I.P
With fly shorty P.Y.T
Yo, DON'T: lie about the cars you got
Or who you hang with, frontin' when you borrowed your watch
Yo, DO: play your game right, if the G's tight
Then you can fuck shorty the same night
Yo, DON'T: trick when you don't have to
You think you ballin'? You turn your back they laughin' at you
You don't gotta keep repeatin you a thug, she heard you
In fact, she attracted to your man that herbed you
DO: spend a lil' dough, only if you know
The bitch gross a lil' somethin' too bro
DON'T: eat the pussy the first night
Maker her bless you, we call that shit gesundheit
DO: set the mood right, Bailey's with ice
A cup of Thug Passion'll make everything right
Yo, DON'T: pop shit like you Daddy Longdick
When you come fast like Fed-Ex and bust too quick
DO: hit positions she will find interest in
DON'T: hit the pussy if that shit's blisterin'
Hope you're listenin', turn up your transisterin'
Hot 97, KISS-FM or B-L-S, with your hand up her dress
Chillin' with your girl while you thinkin' 'bout ya ex
Not too easy not too complex
I break it down, how to adress, the opposite sex
Problems or questions, I can answer them best
Signin' off Dr. Knockboot at your request, peace

[Outro]
Rest havens
Fuck y'all bitches
Y'all niggas get y'all shit tight
Dr. Knockboot gotta come take y'all bitches from ya!
AIGHT?! We out!



[Intro]
Uhh, uhh, where am I going
Where am I?
Yo, it's ill

[Verse 1]
Yo, my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily I find 'em just at the right time
MAC in my right arm
Tequila bottle in my left arm, like Christin
Watching my life go
Can't do myself in
Wolves in the night yo, Hell's men
Two revolvers, I can let twelve spin
Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit
Buck-sixty who wit' me?
My Cris', two L's, twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I ain't shit
No matter how much cash I sit with
Still gotta ask the Lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane
So I drive to cool the pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin'
I ain't saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas
Drunk, almost crashed
I'm going too fast
Highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview
If they stop me I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo nigga watch me

[Chorus]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

[Verse 2]
Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell them niggas nothing though
Bullets wake 'em up well
Take them to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I ain't your mark homey
It's hard to look straight
My foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways
Put out the haze blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in television
Hella women
Jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas expect kilos
For what they not seeing is police expect Rico
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up blasting A/C going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice

[Chorus]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

[Verse 3]
The reason that I want to be alone
Tired of all the things that went wrong
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swig
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, rumors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all
Things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good
Find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib
Tryna see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib
I'm tired...

[Chorus]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself



[Hook]
Honies, cash, weed, cars
Ghetto celebrities and hood movie stars
Gat slingers, now rap singers are who we are
Went from Nasty to Nas to Nas to Escobar

[Verse 1]
The path we all walk starts out long, it's like a boardwalk
Monopoly, some make it around, some go down, it's prophecy
Happy days balancin' with life's atrocities
Hoppin' in V's, knowin' some day I got to lead properly
High up in a five, realizin' the price paid
For this life laid in the light shade
One might say, top of the world's two whips, a crib and a girl
Quick to celebrate it, poppin' corks like they made it
Pretentious, arrogant niggas is senseless
Pro ball players with white wives, peep they night lives
While you could catch me in a crisp white five
Dark tinted, Dijon-scented with Al Green on
My theme song, Love & Happiness, how can it seem wrong?
I mean, before this, I used to rock a Taurus with the donuts
Now, I grown up, I got it chromed up
Got the rap game sewn up, sho 'nuff
Niggas actin' cool but it's really no love
I feel a slow buzz off the Dutch
This is everyday, every second gotta make it pay
Every lesson I learnt got me open
While most of these rappers'll stay burnt

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
With so much drama in QBC, it's kinda hard bein' Escobarro
El Derado Red, sippin' Dom out the bottle
My life is like a Donald Goines novel
We wave glasses like bravo
Drunk niggas with mad problems and shot pockets
My niggas on the block rock this, box cocaine, cook it and chop it
Lookin' to profit in triple ways
Goin' through this difficult stage called life
But each year, my physical's praised
Some fell beyond the reach of help
Cut in the street, thinkin' they could teach theyself
When all we wanted was a piece of wealth
And randomly, feed our family, the streets are insanity
Amply, livin' in this thug's fantasy
Richest nigga in showbiz is what I plan to be
Heavy chain and my QB sway, livin' this king's life
Magazines write about me in this dream, it's all tight

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Now, the main thing that boggle my brain be all the bottles of pain
Ice, the chain and all the followers came
They tried to throw me off track but I caught that
They thought I lost that, but I'm continuin' to make more stacks
Halftime, New York State of Mind, It Was Written was hittin'
Trips overseas, southeast, diamond and riches
Sleepin' on the plane, wake up when we land, feelin' real scared
On the ground, Rollie flush, princess cuts and large rounds
The crews up, findin' time to shine rocks
It's real, you violate, be in a pine box
If it go there, I lay you before you lay me, it's crazy
I didn't make the game, the game made me
Records for the babies so they raised up in mansions
Haters keep hatin' and ladies'll keep glancin'

Y'all know the routine out this muthafucka, word up



[Intro]
Esco let's go
Esco let's go, c'mon
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go
Esco let's go, yeah, c'mon

[Verse 1]
I used to drive in a circle before I pulled up
Now I just go up, they know when I got it tucked
Tip the door man, racist neighbors flinching
They don't know if I'ma rob 'em or if I'm Russell Simmons
They thought it was me, just like Mike Bivins
They pray for my downfall like the mom of Robin Givens
Watching how you living
I just wanted to roll B-L-U-N-T, and watch B-E-T
Picture Amerie eating Free
I'm trying to write hood movies, like Posse and Five Heartbeats
I'm all inside a dark room
My incense smoke took the form of ghost and it spoke
It said, "Nas, you the best on both coasts, you so big
You should write the word slave
On both sides of ya beards like Prince did
So what's this? Fuck St. Nicholas
You the only ghetto nigga in the hood giving gifts"

[Chorus]
WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat)
Esco let's go, c'mon
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat)
Esco let's go, c'mon
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat)
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! Esco let's go, yeah
WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! WHAT IT IS!

[Verse 2]
I jump in the shower, it feel like rain
Everybody wanna be king but can't handle the pain
Used to rap now they all wanna sing
Ask Elizabeth Taylor, when did ice turn to bling
She said, "Nas, it 'cause y'all rock tiny diamonds in the biggest chains
You the first nigga in the game that said fuck fame
You the 5th nigga in The Beatles
You the 10th nigga in the Wu-Tang, so nigga let yo' nuts hang"
But they can't handle it, I'm scandalous, I'm trifling
That's why I'm wifing 'em, quick to stick a knife in 'em
Catch me thinking, drinking, hurting my health
These women keep trying to unloosen my belt
Trying to get my wealth
I feel like Jesus with doubting Thomas', broken promises
I wanna walk the golden streets like where my mama is
But if I do what y'all want, I'll get a thousand years

[Chorus]
WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat)
Esco let's go, c'mon
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat)
Esco let's go, c'mon
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat)
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! Esco let's go, yeah
WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! WHAT IT IS!

[Verse 3]
Staring at the face of my watch
It's like a crystal ball with the ability to make the issue stall
I told my man duck 'cause I know where the missile fall
'Cause the ice is a fortune teller for the rich and small
Went to my man crib who dead and saw his picture fall
I picked it up his voice whispered, "nigga ball"
So I smoke the finest, 85 footer ocean liners
I do it for the have nots of mad spots
That resemble screensavers on your laptops
And niggas can't believe it like seeing that nigga Zab drop
I'll be in Cameroon, bandanas on silk Dior
Sip cream liqueur, green and blue Fila velour suits
Boss move, only thing that I endorse duke
Stash houses, gamble, I don't sweat a loss duke
All true and living, God, we was here first
Parisian linen garb and Kashmir shirts

[Chorus]
WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat)
Esco let's go, c'mon
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat)
Esco let's go, c'mon
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat)
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! Esco let's go, yeah
WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! WHAT IT IS!

[Intro]
Fuck Jay Z!
(What's up, niggas?
Ayo, I know you ain't talkin' about me, dog
You? What?!)
Fuck Jay Z!
(You been on my dick, nigga
You love my style, nigga)
Fuck Jay Z!

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you  the king  you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin'
It's like an AIDS test, what's the results? Not positive
Who's the best: Pac, Nas and B.I.G.? Ain't no best
East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy
I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts left, chest/face gone
How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage
Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne!
I got this locked since 9-1, I am the truest
Name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you  the king  you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Interlude 1]
Ayo, pass me the weed!
Put my ashes out on these niggas, man
Ayo, you faggots, y'all kneel
And kiss the motherfuckin' ring!

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you  the king  you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 2]
I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishers, friendly-acting, envy-hiding snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel and his soldiers
I can handle this for dolo, and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint (dick!)
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G
Dick-suckin' lips, why don't you let the late great veteran live?

[Interlude 2]
I will not lose
God's son across the belly
I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my crown at?
Ill Will, rest in peace!
Let's do it, niggas!

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you  the king  you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 3]
Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you, cause you're my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child?
Scared to smile? They called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TEC's, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I still whip yo' ass, you 36 in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together: I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now cause of your looks?
Ne-gro, please! You no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans you whack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane
To Irv, to B.I.G.  and Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons! Ha!
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z  damn, you on Jaz dick!
So little shorty's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips?
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss!

[Intro]
Fuck Jay Z!
(What's up niggas, ayo, I know you ain't talking 'bout me, dog, you? what?)
Fuck Jay Z!
(You been on my dick nigga, you love my style, nigga)
Fuck Jay Z!

[Hook]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you  the king  you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waiting
It's like an AIDS test  what's the result? Not positive
Who's the best? Pac, Nas and B.I.G
Ain't no best  East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy
I embrace y'all with napalm, blowed up, no guts left, chest/face gone
How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage
Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne
I got this locked since 9-1
I am the truest; name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave
Talk about me, laugh behind my back but in my face
Y'all some well wishers, friendly acting, envy hiding snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take
When these streets keep calling, heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef
Started cocking up my weapon, slowly loading up this ammo
To explode it on a camel and his soldiers
I can handle this for dolo and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G, dick-sucking lips
Why don't you let the late, great veteran live

[Interlude]
I... will... not... lose
God's son across the belly, I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my crown at
Ill Will rest in peace, let's do it niggas

[Hook]

[NOTE: Lyrics are not complete]

[Verse 1]
So you call yourself a God MC, Jay-Hova
Drunk the glass of blasphemy and forgot to pray over
Your game's over
Crossed the warpath of a brave soldier
You're a makeover
My protege trying to Takeover
I was the shepherd that led you
But you bit the hand that fed you
Mad 'cause since I met you I never did respect you
And as hard as it seems
You know that I fathered your dreams
You was a groupie always begging to be part of my team
Another case of a boy and his teacher
I was the first to poison your speakers
So kill all that noise that you're preaching
I understand, all your plans to underhand
Aired threats of you pullin' my card next Summer Jam
Let me make this clear Hova
You had my left overs
She told me your little problem of the day when you slept over
But that's another subject homie
[?] you phony
I'm coming to collect the debt from the years that you owe me
So what you capitalized, only cause I allowed
I'm taking aim at your dome
And reclaiming my throne
Who said I that I ain't still nasty?

[Verse 2]
How you planned on facing
The half man half-amazing
Don't need a fam', Nas is a one man invasion
Claim you hot but you flopped with your R.O.C-familia
'Cause real recognize real and you're not familiar
Call yourself gangsta' but you were begging for pardon
That night in Carbon, when Terror Squad flipped on your squadron
Tried to front on their checks
Till Pun put a gun to your chest
You said it yourself dog, Nas is one of the best
Don't need to search for some dirt to expose you
I leave it up to the flow dispose you
When I oppose you
This is it, I'm calling ya'
Come out and play like warriors
Studied my blueprint then pieced together your formula
Guess the knowledge I speak too deep to follow
That's why your stomach too weak to swallow
The real truth that Nas is the greatest of all timers
Fuck skeletons, keep only weaponry in my closets



[Verse 1]
Peace, peace
Yo, Nasir Bin Olu Dara Visqu Allah
Fist full of dollars in a dice game God
D&G glasses, cloth Kangols, guided by angel with white wings
Nas the Viking, fresh to my ankles, thankful
Gangster see gangster do, I'm Langston Hughes predecessor
Gun on my dresser slang I use upset college professor
More knowledge than Webster dictionary, obituary column plus sign 'em
The first fake rapper murdered for rhyming
The jig is up, gut 'em like fish, Swiss cheese 'em up
My wrist is freezing up sick of these ducks on my hiatus
Poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers
But they small as a shanty in a African village
Soft as cotton candy we assassins and killers
Let shottie off in club floors, pellets spray your familia
You screaming like you love war

[Chorus]
Everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get dropped
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop
But everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get dropped
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop

[Verse 2]
Peace, fuck you with a fist in your ass
You pussy with yeast, you shook of the streets, you a Sisq fag
You know blood baths I makes 'em, fake thugs I hate 'em
8 slug I'm bustin' no discussion or waiting
'Cause now instead of coke rhymes it's laying
No analog it's digital criminals turned rapper times is changing
Niggas get flashier houses more plusher
Bitches giving ass up at ages more younger
Hands on the clock keep turning, hands on a Glock they keep squeezing
Bullets stop in your sternum they stop you from breathing
I'm light year far, your mouth get all white
When I'm near you I frighten your heart
I want you to watch me notice stare look closely
Feel I'm who you 'posed to be real I know it hurts you
Soldiers approach you, you want to squash it, you older than most dudes
Although Nas did you and your whole crew, but

[Chorus]
Everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop
But everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop

[Verse 3]
Peace, I know where niggas sleep; it's too many schemes too many plots
War cost money and man I got too many spots
Hungry niggas get tutored to thinking new shit to come up
Killers fuck with killers you sleeping you getting stuck up
Not me, you're not ready I'm low but I be watching
We all connected so your man know my man
Your man knows my fam' they was cool when they was locked up
Beat cases and now niggas back on the block, what
Bothers is taking secret routes when they drive
Tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job
Peep niggas that got prices on their head so high
Their main niggas'll take the contract, surprise
So we play a mental game, intimidation
Got pussy niggas getting pressed up on and paying
I wish these niggas would step up wait for the day and
Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying
Who ever thinking coming to my vault or the safe
I got some niggas with acid, get it thrown in your face
Play dirty catch your moms in J-30
Whatever whodie we all crazy we all 7:30 now

[Chorus]
Everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop
But everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop



[Nas]
Uh, word
You don't get this everyday, word

[Verse 1: Nas]
With so much drama in QBC, it's kinda hard bein' Escobaro
El Dorado Red, sippin' Dom out the bottle
My life's like a Donald Goines novel
We wave glasses like bravo
Drunk niggas with mad problems
Shot pockets, niggas on the block rock this
Box cocaine, cook it and chop it
Lookin' to profit in triple ways
Goin' through this difficult stage called life
With each year, my physical's praised
Niggas slip beyond the reach of help
Caught in the street, thinkin' they can teach theyself
When all we wanted was a piece of wealth
And randomly feed our family, these streets are insanity
Amber me, caught inside a thugs fantasy
Richest nigga in showbiz is what I plan to be
Heavy desire, hold this 9, ready to fire
You know me, show me the money like I'm Jerry McGuire
It's on..

[Verse 2: Nature]
It's time we set it straight, connect with Dre the correct way
Predictin' platinum in less than a day
So for that we toast, this one's for us while y'all lackin' hope
All I do is write raps, stack, relax and smoke
Watchin' my dreams come true
Stayin' humble in the eyes of others
Politicin' with the wisest brothers
It's Nature, one of the latest, peep how I play this
Straight from the Bridge, one of your kids' favorites
From now 'til the day that I'm stiff
Foul flagrant, pay the rent, always stay swift
Stuck in my ways, type chauvinistic
Since a youth, I had a thing for big Coups
Flooded rings and older bitches
Holdin' my riches in lump sums for trust funds
Fully recovered thugs lust to bust guns
While some'll get drunk, beat wives and cuss sons
A slow process called life, lets show progress

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
When I said I hold my own, I wasn't frontin'
Never claimed to be the baddest, for skills, I got a little somethin'
Comin' through, new clique and tracks
Known for blazin' on The Chronic, that's what put me on the map
Nothin' could give me more pleasure to start this
I worked the hardest
Ducked the farthest, makin' me illest producin' artist
Done crimes, ran from one-time
Could catch me with my crew bustin' rhymes in the Sunshine State
No case, to build I chill with millionaires
Out to make a killin', for real, my resolution this year
Few places I walked, most imagine
New faces I met at beauty pageants
Past cuties now wanna do me
Yo, I never forgot where I'm from
I check for family and every nigga who was down from day one
If you ain't speakin' money language, I can't hang
You know your conversation is weak, so it's senseless to speak



[Verse 1: Nas]
Uhh, yeah, uhh
Blessings of life to the children, they say life is like five days
Words of a old man with silver hair, in his wheelchair
His eyes were bloody while describin' what lies before me
Said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me
It occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer
I'm on top now, slightest drama, I'll have ta kill ya
'Cause animals sense weakness, sharks smell blood in water
Ishmael, Moses and Job knew the divine order
Shit is plastic material, havin' no life
I crash whips and leave it no matter the price
As long as I survive, cop a new five
Circle the block where the beef's at
And park in front of my enemy's eyes
They see that it's war we life stealers, hollow-tip lead busters
There's no heaven or hell - dead is dead fuckers
And your soul is with God, your mind keeps lurkin' the earth
Watchin' your own murder reoccur

[Chorus: Blitz]
For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning
For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning

[Verse 2: Blitz]
It's Blitz nigga the streets glory many die for me
Got knocked, refused 3 to 9's, went to trial for me
Basically I'm just reality, loaded with foul stories of lust
Greed and contempt, no street is exempt
Extended clip shots, hoods barricaded for 6 blocks
I sip shots, watchin em hustlers pitch rocks
Oil paintin' pictures of my pain, illustrate the city in vain
Fallin deep into the pits of the game
This is for the sickest state of mind, in these fatal times
Vest crimes, nickel-plated nines and niggas for the dime
Hear the sounds of them babies cry, still I'm sayin why do we reside
In the ghetto with a million ways to die
Stayin' high to relieve the pain, breathin' in the game
Exhalin' guilt sin and shame, misery and strain
What the fuck will tomorrow bring; luck or anthrax
I stand back, hopin' I'll make it through tomorrow

[Verse 3: Nas]
My skin is a art gallery, right - with paintings of crucifixes
Hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business
Was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders
But since I tasted paper it started losin the friendships
Watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor
How could I tease them with Benzes and feel no remorse
Drivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin'
Red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones
Fuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex
And spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des
Got guns when I'm with my daughter
Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
She knows what daddy taught her, it's lessons
Black princess it's a ugly world
I put my life up for yours, see I love that girl
Could you believe even my shadow's jealous
My skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones
My brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs
Though my songs come from the Father
I'm lonely... hold me, it's gettin' darker

[Chorus: Blitz]
For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning
For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning



[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West & The-Dream]
You'll live, and you'll learn
See 'cause you've never been the same as anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
You'll love, and you'll learn
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else

[Chorus: Kanye West]
If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

[Post-Chorus: The-Dream & Kanye West]
Dark boy, don't you cry
There's too much life left in those eyes
Don't you let that face go waterfall
Don't you learn to love your scars and all?
Dark boy, don't you die
They're just human, let them lie
You just know your world and speak your truth
Let them come to you
For you'll love, in your heart
See 'cause you've never been the same as anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
This is your call, there are no wrongs
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else

[Chorus: Kanye West]
If I had everything, everything
I could change anything, I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Nas]
When the media slings mud, we use it to build huts
Irrefutable facts, merciful, beautiful black beloved brother
You fail to embarrass him, harassin' him
To my life, your life pales in comparison
So go write whatever blog, messiness is not ever the God
Do what's necessary, I'm never worried
Listen vultures, I've been shackled by Western culture
You convinced most of my people to live off emotion
That's why we competin', death by the chrome barrel
Forgot the secrets, my Kilimanjaro bone marrow's the deepest
You can peep at the comments, but don't fall for that
We want freedom, I'm a scholar; an almanac
People do anything to be involved in everything
Inclusion is a hell of a drug
Some people have everything they probably ever wanted in life
And never have enough

[Chorus: Kanye West]
If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Nas]
From the birth of a child, the world is foul
Excursions of a searchin' child
Should learn to take nothin' personal
A parent hates to watch his baby's face
Takin' his first immunization shots, but this is great
The child's introduction to suffering and pain
Understands without words, nothin' is explained
Or rushed to the brain, lookin' up at his parents' face
Like, "I thought you would protect me from this scary place?"
"Why'd you let them inject me?"
"Who's gonna know how these side effects is gonna affect me?"
Who knew I would grow to meet presidents that respect me?
If Starbucks is bought by Nestl, please don't arrest me
I need to use your restroom and I ain't buy no espresso
Soon enough, assume the cuffs, the position
Not new to us, since back on the bus sittin'
Said, "Screw that bus!"  boycotted that bus outta business
The future's us, yet every citizen's in prison

[Chorus: Kanye West]
If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

[Verse 3: Nas]
Watch me as I walk through the folly, golly, New York to Saudi
In Italy, I'm Eduardo Vaccari
But Nasty the hustler, nasty like mustard gas, sulfur
And I could sell Alaska to Russia, no pressure
My first house, 11,000-square-feet mansion
It was a haunted by dead rich whites
Mad a nigga bought his crib to hang up pictures of black Christ
Circular driveways, black cars and black ice
My second house, still in my twenties, illin' with money
Chilled through my spine, spillin' wine, it's funny
Did good for a staircase loiterer, euphoria
What you saw when you seen a teen turn to a warrior
Did every Fourth of July, bustin' in the sky
It was important to a guy who was mob-minded
Future Murcilago driver 'til Lambos got average on me
I started likin' the look like I ain't had no money
Yellow taxi seats over Maybach seats
Just to remind me, just to inspire me
To stay focused, it's a real sick society
Just 'cause I got your support don't mean you're buyin' me
I'm buyin' back the land owned by the slave masters
Where my ancestors lived, just to say a rapper
Made a change, the pants-sagger put plans in action
To lay claim the Pan-African made it happen

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West and The-Dream]
You'll live, and you'll learn
See 'cause you've never been the same anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
You'll live, and you'll learn
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else

[Chorus: Kanye West]
If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

[Post-Chorus: The-Dream & Kanye West]
Dark boy, don't you cry
There's too much life left in those eyes
Don't you let that face go waterfall
Don't you learn to love your scars and all
Dark boy, don't you die
They're just human, let them lie
You just know your world and speak your truth
And let them come to you
For you'll love, in your heart
See 'cause you've never been the same as anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
This is your call, there are no wrongs
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else



[Nas]
Alka Seltzer... in this motherfucker... I gotta take shit
Ay there go my book... I been looking for this book

What, What... Yea

[Nas]
I ain't seen as much death, nor seen as much crime, since the blackout in Queensbridge in 79'
Everybodies a killer now... pimps, playas, and dons
Shorties on the block, push drops and carry on
Niggas look through our window, where ever we drove
Through the tint, to see if the Benz is matching the clothes
We the Queens Kings
I used to view the cats that I owe... see things...
That made me real, but my skin and my soul
Girls who turned hoes
Friends who turned foes
Bad luck niggas who bring Death where ever they go
Never sleep, it feels better to know... it's all real though!...

[Hook:]
Everything Is Real... And... Where We Heading Now... Up to more Money... It be More Fun... Leave with Mo' Bitches... and Carry More Guns

Where We Heading Now... Where We Going Yo... Getting Real Son... We Gon let It Flow... Leave with Mo' Bitches... And Be More Dough... It Be More Fun... Holding More...

[Nas]
How the hell, are we supposed to excel from the street...
Where the Jakes Crew face young kids who wanna eat
Quantum Leap to this Black World, Hustlers, and Ghettos
Cell mates, millionaires, who tussle with the Devil
Bust a lil metal lead (led)
Wrestle you... to the pebbles... on the hard gound
That's if the God's down
It's a struggle, brothers jump bail
To come chill with they niggas on the block, with them rocks for sale
On the hard with the god Shapelle... a Queens Conrad
Yo run and come with the dime bag

[Shapelle]
Yo, Yo-Yo
Ayo I need dat
I got to smoke dat...
Sell me some Chunky Black

[Nas]
So I could smoke away the pain
Try to find my brain
But the thought still remain
Yo it's on again
Once the jail take these chains
Cause I been through it
The drug game I thought I knew it
I got knocked, went to trial
But I blew it
25... but only lived 20 years of my life
Took 5 from me
Got me wrapped up like a Mummy
Now I'm in the system... aka the Devil's Home
Where they tell you where to eat, sleep, shit, and use the phone
Now I'm living with... drug dealers, and chain stealers...
Bitch niggas, who got knocked and turned squealers
Imagine sharing a cell with a rehabilitated addict
Who love fucking with faggots
But I sip alot of Savage
I sat him down, and made him study mathematics
Now I'm sitting in the cell thinking...
About this reefer I'm a get this weekend
On the V.I. (visit)
I rather be... uh, dam, dam

[Fades Out]



[Intro: Nas]
Yo this Nas niggas whuttup?
QB Album coming, niggas Ill Will, Bravehearts
My nigga DJ Clue - put this shit on these niggas
Desert Storm baby 2000!

[Nas]
A Drug dealers dream - flip his last Ki out the game
Cause entertainment money now is off the chain
I put blunts in niggas caskets, lost in the game
I learned about pain, bodies burnt in drug game
But I'm neva gon' die, I neva heard of death
Energy could neva be destroyed
Only the flesh, when you niggas try to murder me
With bullets to my head
This is my you can't kill me niggas
I'm already dead, BRING IT!!
I'm busting bodies fall in the cemetery
Black blood raining on the street
All you niggas, buried y'all
Niggas just came home, fresh out the state greens
Five time felon, thinking he jelling in Queens
It's pitiful - what bid could do, especially federal
Y'all young thugs wilding, see prison
Got a bed for you waiting, I clapped that Satan
But thought I was dreaming
I woke up masturbating in the bed with demons
I cried with every bit of strength of my small body
This is the life I chose, under God I'm tiny
Hard to find me, I popped up, lock shot-up
You can't B.I., see I'm eternal, not luck
You get shot-up, boxed-up next for the grave
Your flow is one dimensional, your level is 2nd grade
You're on top -- WHAT?
Copy and fuck, I said it first, you repeated
Your false crown covered in dirt - defeated
Y'all niggas all hail, the King is dead
He running like a bitch with his tail between his legs
'Stillmatic', still eye 4 an eye, wanna be God
You're just the next rapper to die, fucking with Nas



[Chorus: Havoc]
Yo..
Dunn you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong
Blowing green that's keeping us going
Island hopping getting right on them 747 Boeings
Dunn you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong
Blowing green that's keeping us going
Unconditional love showing
Yo, yo, yo, yo
40th side, 41st side ride

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Me and my Dunns come from the slums
You can't take the slums out my Dunns
And that's how it is, that's how we live
Sometimes I find myself wearing the same shit for days
Not caring, bout what they gon' think or say
I got that, I don't give a fuck in me, it's stuck in me
That's how I 'vantage over y'all niggas, y'all too pretty
We too gritty, like Sanford and Son
Too grimy like Pigpen with jewels on
See we the top rap niggas, the Q-Dogs
You got a lot of nerve, putting out them songs
Knowing that my niggas come strong, so let's get it on
We just getting warm, operation Quiet Storm
Silent wars or we silence the fours
Hav, P, and Nas, got it in the smash, fo'sho
Now it's movies and soundtracks
This is where your career stop at

[Verse 2: Nas]
Ayo, I drink to that
I'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me
You violate, they read your obituary in front your family
You should idolize Nas in the flesh
Don't wait 'til I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt
We shot hoops with coat hangers, got loot with dope slangers
Sold soap to strangers, joked with danger
Rob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit
Bought weight from rastas, travel hot routes
O.T. commute back and forth
Tell shorty get that package off
Fuck being trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit
Caught a case then I beat the shit
D's on the block flash badges, nylon jackets
Big white boys with guns yelling, "Freeze black kids!"
Got my niggas in the pen, eating octopus
Wishing they was on the blocks with us
To watch me and P do it (uh), put the heat to it (uh)
Put it out, first day, the whole street knew it
Bitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music
And think deep to it, now who the truest?

[Chorus: Havoc]
Yo..
Dunn you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong
Blowing green that's keeping us going
Island hopping getting right on them 747 Boeings
Dunn you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong
Blowing green that's keeping us going
Unconditional love showing
Yo.. yo you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong
Blowing green that's keeping us going
Unconditional love showing
Yo you fam to me, and only fam to me
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Dirty fingernails, reaching in my pocket pulling knots out
I daydream of better days, in different ways
Out this lifestyle we live, iced-out with the big fifth
That's why the burnt leather lean to the left
Even though we gained cash on fish
I'm trapped on reason being we ain't all rich
And I'ma be that same nigga for the door
And I'ma still walk the same path, we soon clash
We get stacks, you do the math
We pound niggas out, walk away and laugh
Fresh from out the lab, P and Nastradamus, kid
Rap niggas shit they drawers

[Verse 4: Nas]
Yo they probably did
I aircondition y'all niggas, my prediction is you rewind this
Your highness, Q-Boro's finest
Click your Timbs three times, the wizard is Nas
Grant you a wish, you get rich while listening hard
To my thugs in the prison yard, bench-pressing 200 pounds and up
Feeling like you down on your luck
Raise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library
Appeal the game, all eyes on me
Restrained from, being looked at, it's uncivilized
We epitomize thug song, y'all niggas get mad
Jealous rappers is puss, ain't got no style
No heart and no look, shook
Get stole on, my niggas move right in the moonlight
Y'all niggas get done, I pee on them son, they a small issue
We too official, blue steel pistols
Teflon vests, it's no contest, we hit you

[Chorus: Havoc]
Dunn you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong
Blowing green that's keeping us going
Unconditional love showing
Yo, yo, yo, yo
40th side, 41st side ride

[Outro: Havoc]
Yeah, youknahmsayin'
Not for nothing baby
Knahmsayin' wanna give a shout out to my peoples
YouknowhatImean, Yambo, Ill Will
Killa Black, my brother
It's never gonna be another, word up..
Yeah, you know how we do dunn, word up

[Skit]
The future is nothing but a series of probability made up of decisions that we make right now but these decisions leads to certain events into the future and every human being has a capability to determine their own future
Some are just more into it than others...



[Intro: Scarface]
Yo Nas
I don't think they wanna fuck with this
Gangsta shit, fo' sho'
Danger, danger
Check it out

[Verse 1: Scarface]
It's on, and once again I bring niggas the rough
Fuckin' with us, that get you motherfuckers touched
Hit in the darkest alleys, where the Super Sports rally
Beatin' up the block, leavin' these motherfuckers shot
They ain't ready for the Nakamici
I flip this shit like I'm Comaneci
Now dey a motherfuckin' see me
They try to breeze me, but I got niggas in New York
Comin' kama-kize, sparkin' this shit that keep me off the heezee
Game over, he with my man came over
To scoop me, blowin' dukey, in the black Range Rover
Nasir, tell these motherfuckers what we came for
Tell these niggas why we here

[Verse 2: Nas]
Nuttin' but the New York to Texas connection
Nuttin' but some real shit, what y'all expected
Spaz out, some times dreamin', think I'm awoke
Harsh realities of life, hit me after I smoke
Money satisfy half of my mood, then there's a part of me
That's distant, quiet, the most dangerous side of me
I'm twisted like, Dr. Death, Kevorkian
Flip shit, white gun handle, made of porcelain
My, Houston niggas, come through for niggas
Scarface get a call and we shootin' niggas
Favor, for a favor, that's how we do business
Tryin' to make future figures, we two of the illest, what?

[Chorus: Nas]
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted
Any nigga can get it

[Verse 3: Scarface]
You say you got a problem? Then tell a nigga where he at
So I can study his motions and peel his motherfuckin' cap
Where his brother go to school at? Find out some more information
Bout that bitch and hit a nigga right back
Cause when it come down to the come down;
I'ma pull the motherfuckin' plug on him
Walk up to his face and then gone
Set a example, send these hoes a little message:
They need to be more careful who they mess with, don't even stress it
Leaded, I pull these capers all the time
With the ugliest AK, I blow his motherfuckin' mind
Him and whoever standin' by, I'll tell these niggas, "Let's go"
And then we fin' to ride, and he fin' to die
He fin' to die, throwin' up his own blood
With a slug in his motherfuckin' mug
I do this outta love, cause your money ain't no good here
Just consider that as favor, until I need a favor

[Chorus: Nas]
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted
Any nigga can get it

[Verse 4: Nas]
A killer code, secret untold, how we bury beef with a rose
To his wake we send a wreath that explodes
Beneath us sleep with the Reaper, they sleep eyes closed
That's how real Brad Jordan keep it, to him I owe
Five fo-fo's ready, five masks, five machetes
Attack 'em like Freddy, then we toastin' over spaghetti
I share withcha drama, you share with mine
That's how we killin' two birds at the same time
Send my enemy's ear, I'll send your enemy's finger
With a pinkie ring, that's just a present my nigga
Either way the heat is grave, fuck with 'Face we bring war
Either, you feel these bullets or the Texas chainsaw
Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art
And you my heart, I leave casualties bleedin'
Cause we keep it death for a death, life for a life
Murder for a murder, and I got you it's vice versa

[Chorus: Nas]
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted
Any nigga can get it

[Outro: Nas]
A favor for a favor
A favor for a favor
A favor for a favor

[Intro]
Yeah..
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore, I could see
Through my belly button window, who I am...

[Verse 1]
I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came from behind the sun, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching 'cause I'm nervous, though my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo, developing eyes
Nine-months process, infant size
A prophet in his early stages, mother in her early thirties
Was married to pops, wishing what she carried would drop
I'm not worthy to come from a woman so pure, Ann Jones
Flesh of her flesh, blood of her blood, her blood and bones
Hearing prayers, she asking for my good health
That I'd become a man and learn to make a way for myself
Nervous she was, and her paranoia got in my blood
Mixed with marijuana from my daddy's genes
Lot of screams I'm hearing, it's crazy, both parents is scrapping
I'm not even a baby, a miscarriage could happen

[Chorus]
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes

[Verse 2]
Yo, they must wanna keep me, 'cause four months pass, I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an Ill Will to survive
When I look hard, the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms layin down, I get bored, start to get live
Move side to side, hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm, that's no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food flowing through my mother's tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me, but month three was closer, see
That's when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved, he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered, "If I am born, will I be safe at all?"
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month five, month six went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
September 14th, 73
Get ready, world, doctor's in the front waiting for me
Arms open 'cause they know when I drop, a lot of shit's gon' stop
See how the government start retraining cops
Month nine, I'm a week overdue, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said "Stay calm," holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything is blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face, he's so proud
Wanting to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he say, "At least that nigga ain't ugly"
Placed me in his arms snugly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body, she loved me
And yo, I plan to overthrow the Devil
And y'all bout to see this world in trouble, motherfuckers

{*Doctor slaps the baby; the baby screams*}



[Intro]
Yeah
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore I could see
Through my belly button window who I am...

[Verse 1]
I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching cause I'm nervous
Thought my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo
Developing eyes
Looking out my belly button window
My father's size
On his face he wears a frown
And I'm wondering if they even want me around
Cause I'll go back to spirit town
So I could rest longer before I come back down
The chute again, in the near future when
My moms and pops can agree on this
Was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist
He dumped me off, first they want me then turn around and they dont
You got 120 days do what you want
But as for me coming back this be my last time
Abort me, keep me, give me away, make up ya mind

[Chorus: Sample]
"I shot my way out my mom dukes"
"I shot my way out my mom dukes"
"I shot my way out my mom dukes"
"I shot my way out my mom dukes"

[Verse 2]
They must wanna keep me, cause 4 months past and I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an ill-will to survive
When I look hard the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms is laying down cause I get bored and start to get live
Move side to side hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm thats no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food through my mothers tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me
But month 3 was closer, see
Thats when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic

Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
Septemeber 14th, '73
Get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me
Arms open cause they know when I drop, alot of shit's gonna stop
See how the goverment will start re-training cops
Month 9, I'm a week over due, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face he's so proud
Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he said "At least that nigga ain't ugly!"
Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body
She loved me, and, yo, I plan to overthrow the devil
Y'all bout to see this world in trouble
Motherfuckers



[Intro: Nas]
I want y'all to see this like film
C-Sick on production, Nas on the vocal.. let's go

[Verse 1: Nas]
Lots of fog at night, red brake lights
The freeway beside a restaurant
Cold egg whites sat on my plate like
3 AM, this is a spot frequented by some made men
I'm high on hemp
A fly old pimp just walked in, his suit was shark skin
He woke me up from some of the thoughts I'm lost in
What fame does to niggas, change love to bitterness
Friends to fiends for the audience screams, ridiculous
Jumped up, paid my tab, got in my Benz and went
To my old housing tenement, visit my old friends
Some show love and some are envious
Some got the heart of gold, some venomous
At times I wanna go back to being penniless
Ignorance is bliss, I love being innocent
Ugh, but life's got me on the fence again
And all is real so all's worth mentioning

[Hook: Ultra Nat (sampled)]
If I could press pause, or fast forward past the hardness
Visions written bring words to life like I'm smitten with
Memories real, still ill, now I appear crisp like film

[Verse 2: Nas]
Ice on gold from mossbergs to golf clubs
Ninth hole, the white rose, the life I chose
Bandanna over the eye, Dior sandals
Car doors rise with no touch of the handles
Capiche? Caprese salads on beaches and islands
Far from police sirens at least for a weekend
Then it's back to the streets creepin
I'd like to make a free toast of champagne on behalf of this nigga speaking
Add a splash to the Seagrams
Roll the hash for my world renowned goons this evening
As I circle the table like Babe Ruth
Louisville Slugger in my grip for a fake dude
Bat to the brain with brute force
Splatter my cream velour suit
They hit me with lawsuit
I slip in your whore coupe
Your bitch hate you, word to Jesus
Bet you never knew she toot yay and play with a gay crew
OGs hate to make way for the new
Young niggas want Polo ain't fucking with J Crew
It's safe to say I was once young and innocent
But look what I know now, is all worth mentioning

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nas]
I speak to the street life
The executive chief types
The felons, young mothers with kids they trying to feed right
The botega wearers modern day Che Guevaras
Cuz I barely survived crazy eras
Honest, always make good on my promise
I don't talk it I do it you can hold me to it
I was born to this life I didn't invent it
But I'd be wrong not to take a few meal tickets
You and I are real different, we don't share the same beliefs
Fight in the ring or buy ringside seats
Either you like beef, or you like to spectate
Give me gloves, and I'mma do it how the refs say
We touch em and we come out tussling
The ghetto is my garden of eden
So I keep bobbin' and weavin'
It's intense so I'm hardly breathing
KO, and the winner is Nas, that's how the scene ends

[Hook]



[Intro]
Crime, life, bitches, money
Time..
For my Braveheart's.. my Braveheart's
Uhh, uhh, uhh.. what, what, what?
One time.. two times..

[Verse 1]
From "Breaking Atoms" to "Illmatic", to goin platinum
Shit did change course since rippin it with Main Source
Nine-one, nine-two, time flew
Out of the blue, time for a new young king to rule
Younger frame, older state of mind
Find my name on a page in your Qu'ran, I learned that, in '89
When I was slingin cocaine and baby 9's
Put it in rap and I gave y'all a way to rhyme
God guides us, from public assistance to high rises
Condos, houses where y'all can't find us
Move on your cliques in silence, and wet it up
My meal everyday was a slice and 7-Up
Took advice from a street legend
Identities have been changed, to protect the innocent
Witnessin niggas mistakes, visits at niggas wakes
Cause jealousy infiltrates and seals your fate

[Hook]
Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
Niggas never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO'
Niggas can't come close enough to touch the dough
The lifestyle I live is untouchable
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew
Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do

[Verse 2]
Different ways to come out the hood - in cuffs or a casket
Or crazy, or shootin three pointer baskets
Or maybe - it's the rap shit, all type of tactics
We use to get dough, some choose kickin in doors
I asked a reverand, my mother and a best friend
Less than ten years ago for me to get dough
What y'all recommend is either dope weed or blow
Cause high school was slow, and jewelry was hot
Duckin truancy cops, trains I hopped, to make it downtown
Cisco in my veins, pissed between trains
Canal Street, just lookin at rings
Outside through a glass, went in the store and asked
How much it cost, Korean man brushin me off
For some other big time customer, probably a hustler
Who looked down at my small chain and chuckled up
I said, "I'll be just like you soon, motherfucker what?"

[Hook]
Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
Niggas never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO'
Niggas can't come close enough to touch the dough
The lifestyle I live is untouchable
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew
Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do

[Verse 3]
To them niggas who get life and throw a smile at the judge
Wildest thugs, who blow trial, exiled from the hood
Keepin bitches, comin through on visits
You will survive, them weak freaks think you finished
You first time in you known for poppin your toast
By your third year in you forgotten by most
Niggas wife cut them out of they life, niggas don't write
Friends actin like they don't be gettin your kites
It be ill, niggas coming home and no time, they get killed
Not even home a month and they get peeled, backwards
In they own backyard or in the park
One to the head, two to the heart, you should be smart
In the projects, who gon' die next?
Hoodrats know who let the gats blow and who keep cashflow
Like the niggas know the rats, with some good asshole
Blunts be a good-ass roll while passin your 'dro

[Hook]
Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
Niggas never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO'
Niggas can't come close enough to touch the dough
The lifestyle I live is untouchable
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew
Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do

[Outro]
Feel me?
One time, huh, two times, uhh uhh uhh
What what what? Uhh uhh uhh..



[Verse 1]
Amazing man, got a letter from an Asian fan
He asked, "was I black, was I gon' play Japan soon?"
Wrote back, "Yes" danced in the shower, got dressed
Old school, powdered my neck
I give, but I'm selfish
Tattoo of my chick lips on my pelvis
Well it's the pubic part, excuse me y'all
I think that I became musical
Way before rap I did wanna be the tap dance kid
On Broadway, 42nd Street, legendary
Three-card Molly, Nasir drives a Harley now
FYI, for your info
Insects splattered on the bike window
Tatted innuendo
Just last night, don't know where it came from
Guess it's from a past life
Am I charismatic enough?
Does my charm reach people that could make a change?
If I shoot with straight aim at the positive target
And swooed 'em to make a deposit into my account
Would that be progress?
I doubt

[Chorus]
Something is fishy, something is bothering me
I just can't figure it out
Something right under my tongue, I can't speak it
Can't spell it, yo it's bugging me out
Somebody doin' something wrong to somebody I know
Somehow it's related to me and now I'm frustrated
Cause now I'm focusing too hard
On something that's just too plain to see

[Verse 2]
Savoir faire yeah radiate, conscience clear
About to have a monstrous year
Live in the spot, yeah, err night, deep
Ladies, get ya harder than termite teeth
C'est la vie, I'm engaged
But the crew came to play, they fly free, check me
And they wrist is froze, like toes on a body in the morgue
That was put there by the squad
Look here, I'm the God on the mic on the track
Like Arthur Ashe with a tennis rack, tell the DJ, spin it back
{*beat reverses*}
Yeah, somethin' like that
Uh, it go
Savoir-faire yeah, radiate, conscience clear
About to have a monstrous year
Live in the spot, yeah, err night, deep
Ladies, get ya harder than termite teeth
C'est la vie, I'm engaged
But the crew came to play, they fly free, check me
And they wrist is froze, like toes on a body in the morgue
They were all put there by the squad
Look here, I'm the god on the mic on the track
Like Arthur Ash on the tennis rack, tell the, nah
Everything I be in
Creme de la creme from the linen to the gold front rim
Cold stuntin'
Take a look around, what you found?
Like Master Ace, tell me the world's a faster place
High school students will slash your face
And these white nigga hoods, I'm talkin'
Computer rage is real
Get excited when I'm walkin'
Cause I'm used to dark shades and a limousine tint
Business managers scare me half to death
When they tell me every month what is (?) being spent

[Chorus]
Something is fishy, something is bothering me
I just can't figure it out
Something right under my tongue, I can't speak it
Can't spell it, yo it's bugging me out
Somebody doin' something wrong to somebody I know
Somehow it's related to me and now I'm frustrated
Cause now I'm focusing too hard
On something that's just too plain to see

[Verse 3]
I don't like when my girl try to pull a MC Lyte
Jumped out the whip, through the train
Leave me like D Nice
They say we used to resemble each other
Both last name Jones so we must be brothers
My yearly salary suffers
Cause I hate work, no play make Jack lame
And I rock parts on my head that are hotter than yours
Hot rosado lines, designs your barber can't draw
Posters of Nas on the barbershop doors
Entourage, security galore
When was the last time you rode by yourself, superstar?
Got so much love I shot Cupid in the heart
I'm awakened by my own screams
Lucifer masturbated in my dreams
It means somebody is gonna get fucked in the worst way
And none of y'all hoes touchin' my wordplay
Janitors and men with eighty mil both feel the same grief
The men at work, blue collars of the old men
Shinin' shoes, shoe polish go through the same dramas
They wish for a better tomorrow
I thought only five percenters are conspiracy theorists
Thinkin' what the new world order thing is
But everybody does
The fear of the planet is contaminatin everybody's blood
Triliteral, Democratic parties
Anglo-American military alliance
Study at Oxford, scholars, they watchin'
NASDAQ, Dow Jones, got the world stocks in a shamble
Procter and Gamble
Toxins demand you understand who plans to jam you
Some random thoughts by the candlelight in Paris
As I struggle to be savvy

[Chorus]
Something is fishy, something is bothering me
I just can't figure it out
Something right under my tongue, I can't speak it
Can't spell it, yo it's bugging me out
Somebody doin' something wrong to somebody I know
Somehow it's related to me and now I'm frustrated
Cause now I'm focusing too hard
On something that's just too plain to see



[INTRO: ALL]
1,2, Eye for an eye we in this together
Son your beef is mine So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines

[Verse 1: Raekwon]

Ayo,ayo,ayo, my thug related style attract millions
Fans, they understand my plan
Who's the kid up in the green Land?
Then I skate motivate gettin' (Sniff)
Lifted, me and my chick get eight
Now im coolin' with the clique Mobb Deep and
Nas, word up here's the first prize I generate
Off the head piece, freestyle session word up son


[Verse 2: Nas]

Check it out yo,To my seed, may I lead you into no greed or evil
In the categories of stories I breed my sequel
You know the money, blues, blunts, broken 22's
Monkey see, monkey do shorty sipping sunny dew
On a low like a ????? o,chill shades of flow
Big Havoc at like you know, kid


[Verse 3: Prodigy]

Kid, you don't know me, you don't wanna know me
You tried to blow me your weak side just showed me
Stepped out my door on 41st Side at 12,
Didn't see my crew around so I got bent for search
I had to jet back upstairs so I can stash my 9
It was a Friday night Rikers had it bad one time
Cause niggas getting bagged on a regular son
D's like "Fuck the drugs, all we want is the guns,"
So I proceed with caution, eyes open whenever walking
Niggas be ass talking then be victims of extortion
Hold myself down the only way I know
Niggas pumping back in streets, in debt cause they owe
Street life is like a trial, ass out if you blow
The maximum is death son you know how that go



[Intro: Nas]
Uhh, Lord, Lord, Jah
What I'm gon' do?
Uhh, schhh, Lord, Lord, Jah
Hahaha, shit is all true

[Verse 1: Nas]
Mmm, fried chicken, fly vixen
Give me heart disease but need you in my kitchen
You a bird but you ain't a ki'
Got wings but you can't fly away from me
Driving in your bucket seats, all the way from Kentucky to fuck with me
Look what you done to me, was number one to me
After you shower, you and your gold medal flour
Then you rub your hot oil for about a half an hour
You in your hot tub, I'm looking at you salivating
Dry you off, I got your paper towel waiting
Lay you down cause you're red hot
Louisiana style you make my head rot
Then I flock to the bed then plop, when we done, I need rest
Don't know what part of you I love best
Your legs or your breast
Mrs. Fried Chicken, you gon' be a nigga death
Created by southern black women to serve massa' guest
You gon' be a nigga death
Mrs. Fried Chicken, you was my addiction
Dripping with high cholest-
Like Greeks with his falafel, Italian with his tomato pasta
What roti is to a rasta
Trapping me, you and your friend mac' and cheese
Candy yams, collard greens but you knocking me to my knees
It's killing me when I'm inside, nothing I need more than a fish fry

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Shit, it taste good, I can't lie
It's like you're walking out the tanning salon
When I pull you out the oven from baking, I got you on my mind
Rubbing that sun tan lotion all up over your body
So amazing how you sparkle when I glaze you swine
Hey, my pretty ham hock
It's so feminine the way you submitted and how you gave me power
To massaging me to shower you with lemon water
Marinate you with seasoning and dipping you in chowder
Baby it's like you at the spa the way you gently lay in the pan
While enjoying your butter milk treatment
I sit and watch the grease sizzle bubbling on your skin
Despite the funny fragrance, still I lick my finger frequent
In any event, I'm reflecting on all the signs
That I got saying that I shouldn't fuck with you
But the way you that you would taste made you hard to resist
When I put my mouth on you but that's another issue
Butterflies up in my stomach, when I laid eyes on you
Or was it infection manifesting?
Confused over the feeling, impatiently eating you
Trichina worm chewing on the wall of my intestine
I'm a eat you 'til there's nothing left
Until my very last breath, you gon' be a nigga death
Despite I prepare it the best
And specialize in cooking swine as a chef, you gon' be a nigga death
Who cares if the swine's mixed with rat, cat and dog combined?
Yes, I'ma eat the shit to death

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Ain't that some shit?
I'ma eat some shit until what I'm eating kills me
And I choose to do that, why?
Cause that's just what niggas do, hahahahaha



[Chorus: Nas (Curtis Mayfield)]
("Niggas!") If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it
("Rappers!") If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it
("Niggas!") If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it
("Rappers!") If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it

[Verse: Nas]
Felonious, Thelonious Monk melodic
Monster Cody OG, hard as the Ramparts police
Warring like the Answars and Sunni
I never pull my pants up, sagging my Gucci, and what?
I give a fuck who you bidded with, or where you cop coke
The bitch you with or the reason you not broke ("Rappers!")
I don't count your money, don't want none of your smoke
I don't feel your pain, I ain't none of your folk ("Niggas!")
It's easy to put a gun in your throat
But I ain't on that, trying to sip Coladas where it's warm at
Cognac, crushed ice, y'all know how it is
Elijah said a women half your age plus seven years
Is a plush way to live, this is for the blunted
For the niggas who keep it one hundred
Who hunted by DAs and judges ("Green Lantern!")
This is for the drunkards, stuck in the ghetto, for winos
And old ladies with high sugar levels
Who am I? I'm here to murder the devil
I survive through the struggle and perils, I'm thorough ("Nas!")
Who am I? I'm here to murder the devil
I survive through the struggle and perils, I'm thorough

[Chorus: Nas (Curtis Mayfield)]
("Niggas!") If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it
("Rappers!") If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it
("Niggas!") If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it
("Rappers!") If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it

[Outro: MC Ren Sample]
"Why do I call myself a nigga, you ask me?
Because police always wanna harass me!"

[Interlude: Sample Collage]
"This is once again proof that no routine police stop is actually routine. We saw that last week, of course, in Brooklyn, with the tragedy over there, and then again last night, another police shooting."
"Here's what they think about you!"
"I hate motherfuckers like you. You niggas ain't shit! Think you tough, huh? I could blow your head off with the Smith and Wesson and you couldn't do shit! How you feel now?"

[Hook x2]
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only a few can feel my pain
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only if I could show you
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only if you was in this game
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) You'd feel the whirlwind blow you

[Verse 1]
My daily dose is ferocious
I smoke dope, just as strong as opium
Hopin I'm close to just breakin frustration;
Speakin on podiums
Facin this cold world head-on, dead on arrivals
Young black, poor education guns crack
The gang violence done that
Nighttime, the guns blow, streets got snitches
Dealers, bitches, killers and blunt smoke, clubs open
Benzes, Jeeps, dubs pokin out tires
Thugs with heat, pay security, to let them slide in
Huh, I'm at the corner driftin, sippin, Cognac
To' back, know dat soldiers is packin no secret
Though I'm broken hearted women done left me hopeless in darkness
Smokin, driftin in sickness, stand by oceans watch the sun glisten
I'm soul-searchin, I'm soul-hurtin
What happens when money don't make you happy
I wish this on no person
Ate at the classy places, made all my fashion statements
I got no friends I'm lonely, don't want no pity save it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo, ride in the nighttime, I'm high, got on my flight suit
Hood with the Nike sign, dark colors on
Pull up the block my brother's on
I hug him and we blow trees (sup nigga?) Scopin for police
Guns on our hip, fiends want a fix, stumblin tricks (right here)
We left the drug game alone
Brothers is jealous cause we still call the hood our home
What could you tell us?
At funerals my eyes swell up (damn)
Look at my dog lay in the casket
Twin shotgun barrels had blasted
And rest in peace Barkin, is all I could whisper
As I paid respect, kissed his face and felt hard skin
It's part of God's plan, but why so many niggas have to die?
It's crowded in this place, let the priest and pastor by
Bandana covers my eye, I'm scopin through the room
I see killers and thieves, mob bosses and goons
And yet I feel responsible when my nigga's pronounced dead
Inside the hospital, I wish there's somethin I could do, but..

[Hook]

[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get, get, get down!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh.. uh.. uh..
New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the '70s
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned while he asked me
"What you up to? The cops gon' bust you."
I was a teen drunk off brew
Stumbled I wondered if God sent him
'Cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin' my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin'
They little cooch; gangstas don't die, he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, "Nobody leavin'
Everybody"

[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

[Verse 2: Nas]
Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas who dangerous so don't test 'em
They make you disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of their car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto her-on blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck? I turned to punch him
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay
The letter say, "Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play."
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho
Responsible; the nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you
He responded "cool," but told me out here this how motherfuckers

[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

[Outro: Salaam Remi]
All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?
A shame when you really look at it
My folk against your folk, but we all kinfolk
Somebody got to make a change



[Intro: Nas + crowd]
"Picture us married, you and me," what?
"K-I-S-S-I-N-G"
"I remember the first time, girl you and me . . ."

[Verse 1: Nas]
This ain't no sucka-for-love shit
This ain't no Huxtable-kisses-and-hug shit
First night we fuck, shit, and don't call the next day
This a thug's wedding day, in love
Will we make it? Let us pray
In the limo my niggas, my father, my brothers
Everybody in tuxes gettin' blunted
Hard bottles, mob costumes this ain't no act though
Factual, the pimp shall scoop no more
Yes I'm absolutely sure
I know that she love me, I know that she faithful
We spoke on a prenumptial agreement
Cuz Will and Jada ain't need it
Spoke on eloping, but then I deaded the thought
Cuz she deserves cinderella's ball and the whole shit
But know this
You fuckin' wit' a slit your throat quick
Vehicular explosion, cigar smokin', dark minded, chart climbin
Well spokin say farewell to broke men or rich ones
Throw them phone numbers away cuz this is it hun
Headed to the chapel, my niggas laughin, and its baffling
Cuz just a year ago, it's weird though, I knew I'd get married
To who I knew not
Thought of snatchin Halle up from the dredlock
Pumpin Sade, my head nod
Finally I met the perfect bitch, pardon my French
Rephrase that, someone who make my heart stop
Couldn't wait to blaze that
Tired of hoppin' from honey to honey, HIV spreadin'
Everybody bump the same bunnies
The game, will put niggas in they grave
Right before they part ways, with the street
I want a son to greet, every mornin'
Daughters and more sons tickle my feet
Wife smilin, tellin me it's time to eat
I'm getting married

[Hook: Nas] (3X)
Say hello to the man, goodbye to the gigalo
It was difficult for me to find the chick I want

[Verse 2: Nas]
It was my dream for my queen to put the ring on and ride
Even Martin Luther King had a fling on the side
That's what the negative one's say
Knew my wedding would be one day, but quickly its this day
I know the hoes gonna miss me
Lookin' at ol' photos, sayin' damn he used to twist me
Start chokin' up since I woke up
Bachelor party was crazy, tryin' hard just to sober up
Father saw me in a daze, nudged me wit' his left arm
Told me how him and moms went to city hall, dressed norm
Said she would love me in my Ozwald Boateng
Customized in London by guys who suitup kings
Girl, you get the rings young, you behave
Maxwell he gon' sing, invited Lauryn Hill and the gang
Baltimore, North Cacky, Mississippi
Family packed in, My nigga L is crazy tipsy
Spilled Pepsi on the cuflings, ginger ale got it out
Walked in the church, chest all big to thug it out
My girl walked in, glistenin', different stones
'Bout to go from my fiance' to Mrs. Jones
That's a union that nobody could touch
I gotta be cool, wit ur crazy aunts and uncles
Cuz I love you much, cuz you put up wit' my shit
Court cases, baby mamas
I make a honest woman outta you yet
Everybody starin' at you, I'm at the alter standin
Heart poundin out my chest like a canon
I'm happy, One of my groomsmen, under the music, says don't do it
But they just jokes, some crew shit, they playin', I'm gleeful
I'm stayin I'm sayin vowels all true
Will you take music as your wedded wife? I DO
Sike, this ain't about music, y'all know who I'm talkin to
I'm getting married

[Hook]

I'm getting married

[Intro]
Uhh
Regulate, nigga
Bravehearts, nigga
Live for this
Some of y'all don't live at all
Get yours, nigga
Get yours, baby
Uhh, yo
Yo

[Verse 1]
As the night close down on the Earth like gray dark rings
Light of cities in the nights, destination for Kings
With big dreams, like Castro, overthrew Bautista
From Cuba, and pointed nukes toward the U.S
About to shoot us for revolution; that's how you gotta move
A lot of rules, some locked in solitude
Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised?
The mighty dollar -- or almighty Allah
I'm like the farmer, plantin' words, people are seeds
My truth is the soil; help you grow like trees
May the children come in all colors, change like leaves
But hold before you one of those prophetic MCs
With blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me
Each channelin', from past to present times, heaven shines
Light on those, innocent to how the world grows
Some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes
And you accounted for, everything that you heard
Do not speak to fools; they scorn the wisdom of your words
My heart is wise, bloodshot eyes, the saga never dies
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise

[Chorus]
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners..

[Verse 2]
Yo we gotta be God's children, habitats in tall buildings
Rats crawl in filthy hallways, incinerators
Sinners who faithless, still there's hope, pray it's answered
Dreams turned real - what's a wicked nation?
One with blind men - not takin' charge of the situation
Empty arguments and real conversations needed
The world'll need it, to hear it
Evil tries to weaken my spirit - it's chronic herb
This hurt come from the honest word
I now try hardest to serve my maker, what I learned
Find it's way on the paper, so I could dictate it
Articulate it, luckily - I was put on one of the ships that made it
Through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded
To sink in the Atlantic
Satan jigs the planet, not to get too religious, but
Who decides when and if your life is finished?
If Christ is in this, for the sake of your name, oh Lord
May we break away from the chains abroad

[Chorus]
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners..

[Verse 3]
You wanna buy time? I'm the seller of minutes
I give you every second low-priced, if I sold lies; the truth is
Time waits for none of you, in fact
He can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you
Small visions of better life if cheddar was right
Lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time
Trapped in the slums, beggin' for nuttin' but takin'
Headed for nuttin' but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin'
Judges is not relatin' to pleas, guns bustin' where the kids play
Richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes
In bystanders, get cancelled, D.O.A
Around the way where we from
Hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young
Life is every man's kingdom, a dyin' man's past
And a newborn's, first time to be here at last
And shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain
Hustlin' harder than the generations here before he came
Goin' through the same bullshit as our fathers
Readin' history, but who's the authors?
For some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder
But never lose faith; through the years just get smarter
Ghetto prisoners.. ghetto prisoners..

[Chorus]
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners..



[Intro: Sample]
Forget the terrorist alerts, we need some ghetto alerts
Information we could use, you know:
Ray-Rays on parole, stay off the streets
Invasion!
The Evil Genius
Green Lantern!

[Chorus]
(Ghetto!) The same shit is going on
The crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking
(Ghetto!) The same shit is going on
So you know I seen it all before
(Ghetto!) The same shit is going on
The crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking
(Ghetto!) The same shit is going on
So you know I seen it all before

[Verse 1: Nas]
It's cool to love to win but it's better to hate to lose
There's only one Nas, 'bout a hundred thousand yous
You lose money chasing women
Never lose women chasing money
Niggas is broke plus the wolves is hungry
Morgues full of dead niggas who was taking money
Morgues full of niggas who the last shit they ate in they stomach
Spinach and steak, GORE-TEX boot print still on his face
Its still on his face when we visit his wake
Whatever's undone, I'd do it
Fight against a whole army, one gun I'll use it
Some Sun Tzu shit (Green Lantern)
Creeping on ya like walking pneumonia
You're far from opponents; we could spar for the moments
I stay in deceitful conversations
With creeps with foul natures
Attempted murders trials, the basics
Threatening the witnesses
And relatives of dead victims, its the shit we live
(Ghetto!) Queensbridge thug matrimony, clap a phony
Bullets even hit a cracker in his Abercrombie
Psychoanalyst was asking me what happened to me?
See the 'gnac got to me, then the gat got to me
Then, the homies on the block with the stacks of money
Then, these beautiful bitches was bending backwards for me
Then, lames put the rap game in a casket slowly
Man, I don't give a fuck, this is rap to me

[Chorus:]
(Ghetto!) The same shit is going on
The crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking
(Ghetto!) The same shit is going on
So you know I seen it all before
(Ghetto!) The same shit is going on
The crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking
(Ghetto!) The same shit is going on
So you know I seen it all before

[Interlude: DJ Green Lantern & Joell Ortiz]
Yo, Joell Ortiz, man, go in! (Yaowa!)
Yo, Green, lets take em on a ride through the ghetto!

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Planet Earth (Yaowa), the land of the worst, handle ya turf
Cannonsll burst and break the wrists of amateur jerks (Huh!)
Damn, itll hurt to know your man in that hearse
I seen it ten times (For real)
They get a small article, never the headlines (Damn)
Candles in the lobby next to empty gnac bottles
Niggas drunk, talking shit
Like, When they see this Mac nozzle, but (What?)
Nothing ever happens
Even if it do, nothing ever happens (Nah!)
We dont talk and that aint gutter if you yapping
In the ghetto (Woo!), you could ask a nigga mother what happened and get a echo
Where Im from, its so bad (Bad)
Bunch of ignorant motherfuckers with no dads
Or he there but he dont care
'Cause he nursing his dope hab (For real)
And when him and they moms argue, he always throw jabs
So they grip a chrome mag
And walk around like Who want a toe-tag? (What up?)
Fiending to leave a head see-through like a coat bag
If your life slightly something like the one that Joe had
Then you... (Ghetto!)
Group of Ps, scoop cheese, duck Ds, and squeeze (Cmon)
Breeze in old hoopties bumping new Ortiz (Ah!)
And the hoochies please Gs by getting on they knees
Giving the body part what Scarecrow needs (Haha!)
Im living my life, the shit that I write is from my heart, my word
So go in your pocket, grab a Sharpie, homie, mark my words
If anybody interfere with me and these bucks
I aint only ending careers, dog, Im beating you up
Im still ghetto!

[Chorus:]
(Ghetto!) The same shit is going on
The crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking
(Ghetto!) The same shit is going on
So you know I seen it all before
(Ghetto!) The same shit is going on
The crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking
(Ghetto!) The same shit is going on
So you know I seen it all before



[Intro]
Uhh..
Uh.. speak without thinkin'..
Speak without speakin'.. huh..
Feel without reachin', uhh
That's what it's about
It's about that, inner, inner love, yaknahmean?

[Chorus]
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)
And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)
'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh
And I know he feel us, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause he be with us in the prisons
And he takes time to listen, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh
But he forgive us

[Verse 1]
He who has ears, let him hear
And he who has sight, let him see
He who has life, let him be
See everything goes through change
Those who know don't talk
And those who talk don't know a thing
Men are born soft and turn tough
Dead lay a stiffened heart, I've been kissed by God
I've been hurt, I've been marked for death, almost ripped apart
By the beast but he missed his mark
Alone in the dark my thoughts had sparked up
When I saw my body on the floor, from above I watch it all
Yo it came to me, the pain in me
Many slain empty skulls where a brain should be
It strangely seemed, like it was a dream
But the si-rens had never woke me
Only reason I'm here now is 'cause God chose me
And to me, I'm only just a crook nigga
But God love us hood niggas

[Chorus]
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)
And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)
'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh
And I know he feel us, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause he be with us in the prisons
And he takes time to listen, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh
But he forgive us

[Verse 2]
Day by day by day I sit back and pray
My thugs get packed away, in a maxi-cage
They pass away, they went off the casket way
My gats will spray, but that won't bring 'em back today
So long my crimes now gone for eternity
The team we got left on the set, now turn to me
Can't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind
I ride past the church where they got his body and find
They takin' him to the hearse to put his body in dirt
That's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt
Now it's time to do work, out of love and retribution
As loyalty, he would die for me, no excuses
Loadin' clips up, countin' bullets carefully
For self, though it feels like, he was there for me
Saw the enemy, I ate him, saw Jakes behind me
They ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watchin' me

[Chorus]
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)
And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)
'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh
And I know he feel us, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause he be with us in the prisons
And he takes time to listen, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh
But he forgive us

[Verse 3]
Jealousy in the hood, felonies in the hood
Thugs with guns become celebrities in the hood
Yo it's beef in the hood, smoke trees in the hood
Little girls have seeds by OGs in the hood
It's food in the hood, it's drugs in the hood
You can choose if you would, coke to sniff
Dope to ooze in your blood, parolees
Ex-cons live in the hood, it's jobs in the hood
You can starve in the hood
Your best friends'll fuck your baby moms in the hood
But it's good in the hood, I was raised in the hood
Was taught how to walk and duck strays in the hood
I stays in the hood, got my ways from the hood
Learned to play ball go to the NBA, in the hood
There's AIDS (uh), in the hood (WHAT?)
Our lives are the worst, on top of that, we broke
That's the main reason why God, love us the most

[Chorus]
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)
And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)
'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh
And I know he feel us, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause he be with us in the prisons
And he takes time to listen, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh
But he forgive us
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)
And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)
'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh
And I know he feel us, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause he be with us in the prisons
And he takes time to listen, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas
But he forgive us, uhh

[Intro: Nas (Ron Isley sample)]
Good morning, yeah
(Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah)

[Verse 1: Nas]
Good morning, the same old jerks goin' to work
Garbage man pick up the dirt, the birds don't chirp
There's this nice lady I know, she always speak
With her two children, headed to the school building
Then rush home again to lit housin'
And they are puttin' out the new ceilings
Cause her shits is leakin'
Water keep drippin' down, so she beefin'
Husband keep cheatin', he've been out all-evenin'
Good morning, police shifts the hood is on-in'
So they drive around all-day with bench warrants
Eatin' donuts and sippin' on coffee
Ooops! Sudden stop, it spills on the walkie-talkie
"Damn, this nigga is a creep"
Whispers the police at the Wino in the middle of the street
With missin' front teeth twistin' blunts deep in the cut
It's my nigga so I holla what up, niggas good morning

[Chorus: singer (Ron Isley sample)]
Good morning 'cause I'm still here (yeah)
I didn't get a wake-up call from out there
(Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah)
So I'ma head back to the street for a lesson
And only live by God's blessing

Good morning 'cause I'm still here (yeah)
I didn't get a wake-up call from out there
(Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah)
So I'ma head back to the street for a lesson
And only live by God's blessing, good morning

[Verse 2: Nas]
Good morning, yawnin', dawn is now gone and
New day, toothpaste brushin' my screwface
Follow the light, it's just a great feelin'
And I love life, every minute is pure healin'
Can't you tell I'm much happy nowadays
No more child play, livin' life the foul way
My man just came home speedin'
Tryin' to catch up with 9 years of no freedom
The paper say, "They finally caught him"
He back in, I guess street life got too borin'
Kind of quiet, half the hood is still sleep
If you saw the night before you won't believe it's the same street
Put on my 'lands and, leave the Phantom
Take the low-whip for a trip up to Pan Pan's
Scramble egg whites and turkey bacon
"Ma, pass the hot sauce from out your apron"
Uh, good morning

[Chorus: singer (Ron Isley sample)]
Good morning 'cause I'm still here (yeah)
I didn't get a wake-up call from out there
(Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah)
So I'ma head back to the street for a lesson
And only live by God's blessing

Good morning 'cause I'm still here (yeah)
I didn't get a wake-up call from out there
(Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah)
So I'ma head back to the street for a lesson
And only live by God's blessing, good morning

[Outro: Ron Isley sample]
Yeah, yeah well, well yee-aah
Yeah, yeah well, well



[Intro]
What you say? Can't hear you, man, speak the fuck up
(It's what they want) Word (It's what they want)

[Verse 1]
Nastradamus, skama lit, know when I rep
Flow when I'm set, I got the chips to make a Lotus my whip
Gold on my neck was once a code of respect
For high rollers and vets
Now it's loads of baguettes
Prefer a Mac-10 over a Tec
No matter sober or wet, I smack soldier cadets
Trees that might eject my hype back
Famous phrase "Nigga, light that"
Hoes you fuck ask you: 'Where your ice at, dunn?'
It's all about Playboys when we was young
Could only get tongue, then finally we could cum
Busting in hoes, guzzling 4's
Crack blitz, '86, you turn hustling pro
From bottles, to seven in your hand
To fake Pepsi's, to get to the crack, unscrew the can
Gleam blunted, seeing 100's, stacks of boy with a lean on it
We got it if the fiends want it
The whole block singing the same theme "Don it"
Fuck it, too many crabs in the bucket
If it's ice work, I'm gon' truck it
You gotta love it, you gotta love it

[Hook]
(It's what they want) Fuck it, you gotta love it
(It's what they want, huh? It's what they want)
Fuck it, you gotta love it
(It's what they want, huh?) Fuck it, you gotta love it

[Verse 2]
Some girls get too emotional, fanatic extremist
Compulsive, with malice incentives, the foulest of bitches
Hunger my riches, her childish wishes
Be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes, them hoes
Conspicuous and it shows, tricking this dough
Kicking this flow, slip and you fold
So when your clique roll, I let my clips go
Niggas on opposite poles
I got that confident soul, for those locked in a hole
Inhumane, living hostile opposed
To living on the street, proper from my top to my toes
Aeropostale my clothes, Vernon niggas in Suburbans with liquor
Preposterous foes, finicky foul niggas
See niggas and blacks, there goes a loud difference
Coke sniffing, tapping 13-year-old chickens
You can't be a kingpin when you snitching
Regardless, we still make you a target
We shoot you in jail, chrome objects
Hit you in your own projects, it's street-onomics
This rhyme is edited, credited through ebonics
Miserable cats, hunger paining
Get off your ass, stop complaining
My crew be in Montego Bay Macarena-ing
Marinating, while you home, waiting your arraignment
This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment
Now back in the hood, certain cats, they wanna kill me
They ice grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me
You gotta love it

[Hook]
Fuck it, you gotta love it (It's what they want, huh?)
Fuck it, you gotta love it (It's what they want)
Fuck it, you gotta love it (It's what they want, huh?)
(It's what they want...it's what they want)



[Produced by Megahertz]

[Intro: Alabama 3 sample (Nas)]
Woke up this mornin' (yeah)
You got yourself a gun (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got yourself a gun

[Chorus]
Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

[Verse 1]
My first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome: I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoo's real, with "God's Son" across the belly, the boss of rap
You saw me in Belly with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames a huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
But the QB don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody!

[Chorus]
Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

[Verse 2]
Yo, I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
And if I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed
Hair parted with a, barber's preciseness
Bravehearted for life, it's
The return of the Golden Child, son of a blues player
So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too
Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never! 'Member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me "God's Son" with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow
What could beat that? Not a soul reppin'
Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo

[Chorus]
Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

[Verse 3]
It's, the, return of the prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist glist'  I floss
Stick-shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta with ya (uhh)

[Chorus]
Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)



[dmx - dialogue]
I ain't goin back to jail
Next time, the county or the state see me
It's gonna be in a bag

Uhh! this is it baby!
End of the road, ha hah!
When you a dawg, you a dawg for life!
You don't hear me though, you don't hear me though
You don't hear me though, c'mon, c'mon!

[method man]
Watch them young guns that take none, nobody safe
From the friday the 13th, ghetto jason
Itchy trigger finger achin, snatch yo' ass
Out that s-class for fakin, forty-fo' blast
Is a bloodbath, take your first step down a thug path
Ain't no love here, just slugs here
Kids know the half you get plugged here, that's just impossible
For the weak to last now behold the unstoppable
Third eye watchin you, watchin me
Throwin rocks from the penalty box, cop a plea
Young g we was born to die, don't cry for me
Just keep the heat closely and ride for me
Cause we family for better or worse, you and i
From the dirt, you snatch purse, so hard it hurt
To be here, and each year, I'm pourin out more beer
For deceased peers, holdin fort
Police line 'do not cross', they found his corpse
In the loft with the head cut off, and butt naked
Homicide the crime method, add another
Killer verse to the murder record, the grand finale

[lennox speaking - movie dialogue]
Who wan' test me, c'mon!
Me shot pussy-hole fi fun

[nas escobar]
Hot corners, cops with warrants, every block is boring
Friday night, getting bent, lick a poem
My dawg, not even home a month yet, and blaze a girl
In the stomach, he robbin niggas who pumpin
Lil' blood got popped, by the group home cat
Everybody nervous in the hood, pullin they gats
Fiend yellin out, who got those? go and see
Shorty snot-nosed, he don't floss but he got dough
Thug faces, fugitives runnin from court cases
Slugs shootin past for the love of drug paper
Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers
And god'll throw a beam of lightning down cause he feel us

May the next one, strike me down if I'm not the realest
The mayor wanna call the swat team to come and kill us
But, dawgs are friends, if one see the morgue, one'll live
To get revenge, and we ride to the end
Bravehearts blow the lye with henn, and still rise
Took alive with live men, my man got three six-to-eighteen's
And only five in, the belly of the beast
Didn't wanna hear the shit I tried to tell him on the streets
It's irrelevant, the beast love to eat black meat
And got us niggas from the hood, hangin off his teeth
We slangin to eat, bringin the heat
Bulletholes, razor scars is the pain in the street, huh

Chorus: ja rule (repeat 2x)
When you a dawg you a dawg for life (ride or die)
My dawgs feel pain from love (see eye to eye)
Give us one shot at life (let us fly)
Come on niggas! (we dawgs for life)

[dmx and lakid {dialogue}]
There's mad money out here dawg
Mad money out here
What you tryin to get it? (word up)
You gonna bust your gun to get it? (tsh, whatever yo)
I hear you I hear you

[dmx]
Uhh, I've lost my grip on reality or so it would seem
Pinch myself to wake up, cause I know it's a dream
Niggas that don't know me see me and think i'ma rob em
Niggas that know me well see me and think i'ma problem
I'm just a nigga that's misunderstood
But word to God I turn your last name to underwood
Cause if I see it, i'ma take it and run with it, that's me
What type of bullshit is this nigga on? that's d
The dawg come and getcha outside
The more blood flows, when I plug holes with the snub nosed
Gun blows, bullets whistle, wouldn't miss you
Hit you all up in your mouth like it tried to kiss you
Drama, it's right here, how much you need?
Beat you down with gat see how much you bleed
How much you plead, for your life, you was a killer
And all the bitches comin up out that ass you feelin, gettin realer
Now beg for your life, one more time, one more crime
One more nine, c'mon cry nigga
It's over! this is the shit, that hits hard
You either the last one standing, or the last one to fall

Chorus

[Intro]
(Right Right)
Check me out y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

[Verse 1]
Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number like a pager
Cause I'm an ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change, I'm a performer, strange
So the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme
It's halftime

[Chorus]
(Right) It's halftime
(Right) Ayo it's halftime
(Right) It's halftime
(Right) Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel

[Verse 2]
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young I was a fan of the Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83 I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch "CHiPs", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual
Of rap I'm a professional, and that's no question yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
Cause in the streets I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore rap and tell me, "Nas ain't all that"
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, I assume, the real rap comes at halftime

[Chorus]
(Right) It's halftime
(Right) Exhale, check it, it's halftime
(Right) It's halftime
(Right) It's real in the field
Word life, check it

[Verse 3]
I got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' them fast, doin' this that and the third
But chill, pass the Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinee
Puttin' hits on 5-0
Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin' fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo I'm out

[Outro]
(Right) It's still halftime
(Right) To the Queensbridge crew
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
(Right) '92, it's halftime
(Right) Yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost
Halftime

[Spoken: Nas]
Y'all alright over here? Over here?







So many niggas get fucked up in the game
See that's where they get caught out there in that word "Game"
Cause its not no fuckin game

When you hear shells coming at cha
Hot Ones from a shotgun I bet nigga runs faster
Loose a shoe to get away from a blaster
Think about that casket you don't wanna be in that shit
Quick to take his signin you taking every bodies package
Money over Bitches was a loyal practice
So you act as if money was no object
Spinin 5 zues trips for your whole projects
Epcot center linins for ya bitches, roli's for dogs
Now we in the mall slayin by his bitches
Everyday I reminiscing how he was living having fun
Cause any day could have led to prison
Not for a short bid cause if the feds ever caught kid
It be like 25 years conspiracy
Another 25 for rico snatching up him and his people
He had his jeep bullet proof with silencers on the desert eagle
Flipping bricks in Gary Indiana
He had it locked down from the streets to the slammer
Only trusted Two things his trigger and his hammer
Used to be a bum till had a six month run
Had a law suit three G's the case was won
Met with Mexican hoya cop boya
Bought barber shop named it after c shaday
There where they found his body
In a barber chair face down, bullets in his chest
Sliced apart from the waist down
Planned to sell his shop stick hoya for everything he got
Take jewels and his 5
Then his shoes where cemented
Drop his body in the tide but hoya was wise
Even when he ain't around he got ears and eyes
Gotta stay a step ahead of this game to stay alive

Chorus (X2)

Always wanted things always wanted cash
To Live fast get the girls with tha biggest ass
Fuck her 9 to 5 gotta drive a 5
Now that I got it the Hardest Thing To Do Is Stay Alive

Coke head Saundra she grew in Gruwana
Her man was large and Saundra was his baby mama
Stayed in drama Fighting with hood rats that he was fucking
No job all day she did nothing
They son was 7 years old, she really was a wifey
First should she would transport blow overnight for a G
He paid up front they laid up once
She got pregnant she would dead it
She had a boy, named her son infinite after his father who did dirt
She didn't noses after would follow
Capsules and bottles and crack in the back of his baga
He let her drive while he drove the burgandy 5
He often talked about how he wants to murder these guys
]From off of burger street, had nat workin the street
Lifestyle richest nigga from how he use to be
Never thought he'd rock diamonds never took weakness for kindness
That's how he gradually grew
Did a Favor for a favor now the nigga in with the crew
And Now he live major house in dix hills next to Brook Shields
With the cook and the maid shit was real
Saved his first bill, maid, and his bodega
Good Luck playa sign on the paper taped to the window
Escaped from a would be kidnap
And slept and thought niggas fearless rep until he got wet
Would had the world in his hands his girl did a scam
The owners rich is boning niggas to get rid of her man
Welcome To The Game Baby

Chorus (X2)

The Hardest Thing To Do Is Stay Alive...
The Hardest Thing To Do Is Stay Alive...
The Hardest Thing To Do Is Stay Alive...

[Intro: Nas and Puff Daddy]
Escobar Season has returned
It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
It's life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turnin' back now
This is what makes me, this is what I am
Feel me? Let's go

[Chorus 1: Puff Daddy and Nas]
You can hate me now, (Q.B.)
But I won't stop now (Real niggas)
'Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts)
You can hate me now (C'mon)
But I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Ad-lib over Chorus: Puff Daddy (Nas)]
Well, you hate me, I'm gon' hate you too
It's as simple as that
Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die!
You don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Go down any way you want it to go down (do it now)
Weak, jealous motherfuckers! (do it now, do it now)
Fuck y'all!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, flows that I try
Close your eyes, picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
Money is power, motherfucker!
I got millions of thugs on salary

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Ad-Libs: Nas and Puff Daddy]
Do it now! I told you, do it now!
Let's go

[Verse 2: Nas]
You wanna hate me, then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money? Funny, I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin': "That's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with."
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same OG
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that  what you expect, ho?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right?

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
You think I'ma come this far
And let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too!

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
I like this, I like the way this feels

[Verse 3: Nas]
It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights
Hell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were pickin' them up
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just the theory of man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin', c'mon!

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me ever in your life
And that's what you can't understand!

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Outro: Puff Daddy and Nas]
You can hate me now, (C'mon, niggas!)
But I won't stop now (Do it now! Get this shit over with!)
It ain't gon' never stop, niggas!







[Chorus: Jully Black & Saukrates]
If Heaven was a mile away
Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
If Heaven was a mile away
Or save it all for you?
If Heaven was a mile away
Would I fill the tank up, put gas
And be out the front door in a (flash?)
Before reconsidering this hell with you
It ain't you, it's the things you do (do)
It's tearing my heart in two
I would've fell with you, to Hell with you

[Verse 1: Nas]
If Heaven was a mile away, and you could ride by the gates
Would you try to run inside when it opens
Would you try to die today?
Would you pray louder, finally believe in His power?
Even if you couldn't see Him, but you could feel Him
Would you still doubt Him?
How would you start actin'?
Would you try to put the keys down, thinkin' every drug sale that you make in the streets he can see now?
Would a fiend even want to get high? Would he stop smokin'
If he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in?
To get away and escape from the craziness
And I bet you there's a Heaven for a atheist
It's hard takin' this, racist planet
Where they take a younger brother in a hand-cuff
Even if he innocent, "Nigga, get on the car!
Put your motherfuckin' hands up!"
Thinkin' I'ma lose it, my mom's in chemo
Three times a week yo, keep tryin', but people, it's hard
And God, your young soldier's not so bold but needs you
This world's my home, but world, I will leave you

[Chorus: Jully Black & Saukrates]
If Heaven was a mile away
Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
If Heaven was a mile away
Or save it all for you?
If Heaven was a mile away
Would I fill the tank up, put gas
And be out the front door in a (flash?)
Before reconsidering this hell with you
It ain't you, it's the things you do (do)
It's tearing my heart in two
I would've fell with you, to Hell with you

[Verse 2: Nas]
Nigga, what you think, I'ma stop building?
I'ma stop feelin' like I'm Amistad's great-great-grandchildren?
How I'm not gonna want to make millions
Since the quarter water days, in the hallways
Makin' fake gold caps
With the Reese's Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day
But then my style has quite a while
That same type as Ill and Al Skratch
Game time took 'em cats, never looked back
Cristal, blowin' dub sacks
That's when it all just hit me: you see, the broads and Bentleys
Is nothin' unless my niggas spend it all with me
I'd give it all away quickly
Just to hear them all about some new kicks
Free of any autographs, and not to be recognized, forgive me
It's becomin' unbearable, makin' hits is easy
Put a famous bitch on a hook, there you go with a platinum CD
I know you heard the noise, preachers touchin' on alter boys
Sodomizin', not realizin' God is watchin', before the Lord
How could they do the Devil's work?
A man give another man head in Church
Hell, it hurts just to fathom the thought, wishin' that I fled the Earth

[Chorus: Jully Black & Saukrates]
If Heaven was a mile away
Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
If Heaven was a mile away
Or save it all for you?
If Heaven was a mile away
Would I fill the tank up, put gas
And be out the front door in a (flash?)
Before reconsidering this hell with you
It ain't you, it's the things you do (do)
It's tearing my heart in two
I would've fell with you, to Hell with you

[Outro: Nas]
You trapped in your own hell
Every day I wake up I'm blessed
Every day you wake up and breathe another breath, you blessed
To all them niggas runnin' around
Talkin' about, "I'm fucked up," "I got to get on," "I got to"
"I'm in the grind," "I'm fucked up"
Yeah, we all in the grind
But look at the beautiful shit around you, it's a beautiful life
All my niggas locked up, keep ya heads up
Heaven's just a mile away
I'm talkin' Heaven on Earth, ain't got nothin' to do with money
Got nothin' to do with nothin' material
I'm talkin' about Heaven in your own heart
In your own world, baby, in your own existence
To my moms, look at me, baby
I love you, girl, your boy's shinin', God's son...



[Intro: Polow da Don]
QB where the fuck y'all at?
Ha... YEAH, let's go
GETS MONEY!

[Chorus: Nas & (Keri Hilson)]
Chain gleamin', switchin' lanes, two-seater
Hate him or love him for the same reason (fresh)
Can't leave it, the game needs him
Plus the people need someone to believe in (yes)
So in God's Son we trust
'Cause they know I'ma give 'em what they want
They lookin' for a (hero)
I guess that makes me a (hero)

[Verse 1: Nas]
Another chapter of the cleanest rapper, distinguished gentlemen
Crooks & Castle on his back, Maybacher
Exotic lady eye-catcher, holla at ya, call me the chiropractor
Workin' like Muay Thai class, get perspire out ya
And of course I've been the boss since back when
Rockin' D Boy, Fila velour in one-ninety black Benz
Now they shut down the stores when I'm shoppin'
Used to be train robbin', face covered in stockin'I'm him

[Chorus: Nas & (Keri Hilson)]
Chain gleamin', switchin' lanes, two-seater
Hate him or love him for the same reason (fresh)
Can't leave it, the game needs him
Plus the people need someone to believe in (yes)
So in God's Son we trust
'Cause they know I'ma give 'em what they want
They lookin' for a (hero)
I guess that makes me a (hero)

[Verse 2: Nas]
Rubber-grip-holder, reloader
Come at me, I'ma rip your soldiers in half
Silverback ape, nickel-plated mag
Young, rich and flashy; young bitch, I'm nasty
All black clothes 'til ice lay on me so classy
And every time I close my lids
I can still see the borough, I can still see the Bridge
I can still see the dreams that my niggas ain't never lived to see
Tell them angels open the door for me
From nine Berettas and movin' raw
To chillin' in wine cellars, sticks and humidors
That's what I call mature
That's what I call a G, that's what I call a pimp
That's what I call a gangsta, to the fullest, shit
I try to make more cream
By every September 14th, that's my dream
So I can be more clean, as I grow yearly
I can see things more clearly, that's why they fear me (let's go!)

[Chorus: Nas & (Keri Hilson)]
Chain gleamin', switchin' lanes, two-seater
Hate him or love him for the same reason (fresh)
Can't leave it, the game needs him
Plus the people need someone to believe in (yes)
So in God's Son we trust
'Cause they know I'ma give 'em what they want
They lookin' for a (hero)
I guess that makes me a (hero)

[Verse 3: Nas]
This universal apartheid, I'm hog-tied, the corporate side
Blockin' y'all from goin' to stores and buyin' it
First L.A. and Doug Morris was ridin' with it
But Newsweek article startled big wigs
They said "Nas, why is he tryin' it?"
My lawyers only see the Billboard charts as winnin'
Forgettin' Nas the only true rebel since the beginnin'
Still in musical prison, in jail for the flow
Try tellin' Bob Dylan, Bruce or Billy Joel
They can't sing what's in their soul
So "Untitled" it is
I never change nothin', but people remember this
If Nas can't say it, think about these talented kids
With new ideas bein' told what they can and can't spit
I can't sit and watch it, so shit, I'ma drop it
Like it or not, you ain't gotta cop it
I'm a hustler in the studio, cups of Don Julio
No matter what the CD called, I'm unbeatable y'all, let's go!

[Outro: Polow da Don]
Yeah, Nas, Polow da Don



[Verse 1: Nas]
The phone rings
Another peaceful moment is lost
Latifah's chest jingle in Set It Off
I press pause in the bed as a king
I let it ring 4 or 5 times
Answer while I'm puffin' my green
It's Tamika sayin', "Hi Nas"
I caught a flashback of her askin' me was I asthmatic 'fore I tapped that
She offered me dinner under the moon
I said, "Sorry I made plans at Ray's Boom-Boom Room"
Nine push-ups, strength's gone at the tenth one so why hook up
The pimp's gone off the Patron Tequila
Put on my Lee's and the original Filas
Sedated from L's, 380 cocked, naked ladies laid up in tels
Like Whodini I chose, gazelles don't lean on my nose
Drivin' by the clubs gleamin' and go
Heads turn it's a freak show
I need them to know, when will they learn
Nas need a queen not a ho to
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick, someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me but won't fuck with my enemies
And you can sing along 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy

[Chorus: Claudette Ortiz]
Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be groovin'
But let's take, it, slow

[Verse 2: Nas]
One for the honies who roll blunts up but don't smoke
Two for the few who see potential in you when you broke
Three for the G they got, they game is hot I give it to you
Double life wife, play with the man that's livin' with you
Here's the issue, a woman gotta be stunnin'
Get to a man's heart through his stomach
You gotta be skilled in the culinary arts
Know a brother stay mad hungry when he spark
Hit the museum, maybe Central Park, you mentally smart
Picture we in Tiffany, you becomin' my counterpart
If I want Chinese then you buy me a wok
If you want barbecue I call Professor and Ak
'Cause you point out my enemies, someone who's into me
But not a hyper chick- someone with the proper energy
A girl that's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you could be the one 'cause I'm lovin' ya energy

[Chorus: Kelis]
Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be groovin'
But let's take, it, slow

[Verse 3: Nas]
Slow is the way
Holdin' hands, tongue and hickeys
Hope and I pray where I run at you run away with me
That's if my gun get busy we gotta get outta there
Hear sirens jump in the stick drop a Sedan and hide for years
Like no one else in the world did this except for us two
You gotta trust me, I gotta trust you
If coppers bust me it's me you rescue, this to the death boo
You rep me respectfully that's how I rep for you
Retired from pimpin', perspire is drenchin'
As we suck and fuck each other's minds out commission
Time's out forbidden
Until we pass out, that's when we stop
We give it all we got, give it all we got- we hot
Give it all we got, give it all we got- we rock
Give it all we got, give it all we got
You 'bout the baddest thing
Since Michael had Billie Jean
And Prince gave you diamond's and pearls
But to be my queen you must...
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick, someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you can be the one 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy

[Chorus: Claudette Ortiz & Kelis]
Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be groovin'
But let's take, it, slow

[Outro: Claudette Ortiz]
I can be, what you said
That you need, I can be, all that
I can be, I can have your back, baby
I can be, what you said
That you need, I can be, all that
I can be, I can have your back, baby



[Intro]
The world is yours is something is, um, something I got from Slick Rick
Back in the days, hey young world, the world is yours
From the movie Scarface where, uh, his whole thing was the world is yours
He sort of bluntly said the world is yours out there in the sky
He looked at it, uh, something from god telling him, you know, the world is yours

Yeah, yeah, yeah (It goes)

[Chorus: x2]
Hey young world... the world is yours
Hey young world... the world is yours
Young world young world... the world is yours
Young wo-ah-huh-huh-huh-urld (It goes)

[Verse 1]
Young people are so special
It's so good what god blessed you
Death to unethical thoughts that surpress you
Like diseases, they conjure up inside the test tubes
To stress you, beaurcratic genocide
But maybe I'm a wreck loose
It's just my observation as a whole
Human extermination, population control
Assuming my generation is young and out of control
But y'all don't understand this
Y'all out of touch and y'all old
I promise to stay in full, try to stay on course
And right the wrongs of my father with my baby boy
Life is full of problems, don't go away when ignored
Life is long it's important that it's played like a sport
Every skyscraper you see started off as a thought
And Ricky Walters told me that the world could be yours
So hey young world, yeah hey young world
The world is yours

[Chorus: x2]
Hey young world... the world is yours
Hey young world... the world is yours
Young world young world... the world is yours
Young wo-ah-huh-huh-huh-urld (It goes)

[Verse 2]
You could have been arrested
Locked down doing 10 on a fed bid
But you home so your know you blessed, kid
But trust me, I know some people who are not as lucky
Cause on the small drug beef
Gone 15 years it must be
Conspiracy, a killer sees
No liberty or justice
Congress talk nonsense
It's consignment for us hustlers
There's no 401k retirement for us hustlers
It's one way, until death
We die young, it's bum luck
Young bruh, tell me why you want war?
Tote a gun for, whoever to pump forth
With tough talk, get done off
New York City streets they carry the worst gun law
But still it's real, we do it with tools
It's ungod, under the code of hood, play your role
And maybe you'll live to grow old
Kids and a wife and household
Slow your roll before your soul
Eject from your body and you turn cold
Take advice yo, take a higher road
Hey young world, yeah, hey young world, yeah (It goes)

[Chorus: x2]
Hey young world... the world is yours
Hey young world... the world is yours
Young world young world... the world is yours
Young wo-ah-huh-huh-huh-urld (It goes)



[Talking: Nas]
The wild Gremlins
Ya'll know the F. right?

[Verse 1: Nas]
When the winner lose... and the losers win
Nobody scores just a few good men
But everybody sins
A lot of young die
Fall in the trap, strung high
Try to go legal, but the hood calling you back
Flipping the crack, cause I miss it for example
Watching base-heads wildin' on my first sample
I elevated up, since snakes in my circumference
Now I hit my niggas with cakes and say, "Pump This"
Thank god for cracks, corners, and marijuana
Hoodrats and good gats to carry on ya
I got dead friends, misled friends, crackhead friends
Wild Gremlins, who "bust led" friends
Silent weapons for quiet wars
Or loud gats
Tussle too long, some shiny moves the crowd back
It's powerful, niggas would die over respect
And money is secondary to that whole aspect

[Hook: Nas]
I Love it, when I'm... High
I'm at my Best, when I'm... Hiiigh
I like my sex, when I'm... Hii-iiigh
Cash, Tecs... Flash Tecs, when I ride through ya projects
And clap at sets, a nigga... High
North, South, East, West, riders get... Hiiigh
I take ya'll niggas on a lyrical... Hii-iiigh
I twist it up, Listen up to the real shit, feel this, REALNESS!

[Nas:]
Niggas rushing to the top, not knowing what it takes to be...
King Of The Industry, the wise move patiently
Ya niggas is hating me, won't be happy till I'm back witcha...
Selling crack witcha, half & half on a pack witcha
My pen and pad, paint a black picture...
Of young goons passing liquor, after-hour store mass of niggas
Street corner combos, staggering winos...
Tahoes coming through, blasting songs I know
Niggas scheme, girls pregnant by sixteen
Clique out to get rich...
Empty clips for cream
Same funeral home, for different stiff bodies
Once a month a new family goes there, it don't surprise me
Cried 'til the tears, dried up inside me
Revenge to the end, laws in NYC
Got up by the way I used to be...
Apartment 5D... where dope fiends in the hall try your knob when you sleep
Surveillance Cameras in my house now, watching you creep
Spot you from deep, guns for all possible beef
Niggas try to rock you asleep
Kidnap your whole fam for a week
Asking for ransom, niggas starving, dying to eat

[Hook: Nas]
I Love it, when I'm... High
I'm at my Best, when I'm... Hiiigh
Yo... I like my sex, when I'm... Hii-iiigh
Cash, Tecs... Flash Tecs, when I ride through ya projects
And clap at sets, a nigga... High
North, South, East, West, riders get... Hiiigh
I take ya'll niggas on a lyrical... Hii-iiigh
I twist it up, Listen up to the real shit, feel this, REALNESS!



[Verse 1]
Patient
My faith is highly favored by the father, love to all
Rest in peace to Zanu, the barber brought cases
Celebrate and take us back to thought
The real New York, death to rapists and rats
The touch school to Brooklyn stories
The kings, the lifers, the lords of Queens
Or the stories on Puerto Rican righteous, I heard things
Know some people who know people
Getting money, the broke people claim you owe some people
It's easy to explain anything to a real liver of life
Who live where you live and see shit the same
Gotta watch who you joke with or get checked
We easily mistake jokes for disrespect
Where I'm from, it's never over if somebody dies
Somebody gon' ride, years later, somebody son, double 4-5
You laid up in ICU, hoping you survive
Too many stories like this one

[Chorus]
What's shaking?
My faith is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
Patience
My faith is highly favored by the father, peace to 'yall (Peace to y'all, yeah)
What's shaking?
My faith is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
What's shaking?
What's shaking?

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah
Some are caricatures, amateur boys
I'm like a classic pianist with a handful of sores
Bandages on my finger, still managing chords
Like a live band, performing in a sand storm
Blind, but I still hit the right keys
Swift as a life breeze, dripping
In fear of God, scented in Diptyque fragrance
Some nights Creed flavors, I am motivation
I don't talk on the next man, I am never hating
This daily bread, holy bread
Alphabetical numerals, codes of red
What's more dense, gold or lead?
What's more expensive?
The OG said, "No matter what it is, rent it
And never buy it, it's all temporary possessions
We don't own nothing on this Earth but our soul and that's the lesson"
Project apartment parties, rest in peace to Marley
Try not to get booked by Officer Laverty

[Chorus]
What's shaking?
My faith is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
Patience
My faith is highly favored by the father, peace to y'all (Peace to y'all, yeah)
What's shaking?
My faith is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
What's shaking?
What's shaking?



If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Hip hop just died this mornin'
And she's dead, she's dead
Yeah, niggas smoke, laugh, party, and die in the same corner
Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama
Rich-ass niggas is ridin' with three llamas
Revenge in their eyes, Hennessey and the ganja
Word to the wise with villain state of minds
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
(Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind)
Whenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up
Any ghetto will tell ya Nas helped grow us up
My face once graced promotional Sony trucks
Hundred million in billin', I helped build 'em up
Gave my nigga my right, I could have gave left
So like my girl Foxy, a nigga went Def
So, nigga, who's your top ten?
Is it MC Shan?
Is it MC Ren?
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Hip hop just died this mornin'
And she's dead, she's dead
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
Come through, something ill, missin' the ceilin'
What influenced my raps? Stick-ups and killings
Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings
Criticize that, why is that?
'Cuz Nas rap is compared to legitimized crap
'Cuz we love to talk on ass we gettin'
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh, I they like me in my white tee
You can't ice me, we here for life, B
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that we not takin' it lightly
If hip hop should die, we die together
Bodies in the morgue lie together
All together now
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game
Reminiscin' when it wasn't all business
If it got where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed
Hip hopper since a toddler
One homeboy became a man then a mobster
If the guys let me get my last swig of Vodka
R.I.P., we'll donate your lungs to a Rasta
Went from turntables to mp3s
From "Beat Street" to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts
I'm lookin' over my shoulder
It's about eighty niggas from my hood that showed up
And they came to show love
Sold out concert, and the doors are closed shut

And she's dead, she's dead)

[Verse 1: Nas]

Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama
Quick fast, trigger fingers on the llama

[Chorus: Mark B. Mayfield]
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination to change the situation
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination to change the situation

[Verse 1: Nas (Mark B. Mayfield)]
Yeah, Feds feast on street dons, look at their teeth showin'
Salivating at the mouth, South to East Orange
Keep pourin' that liquor, but nigga don't sleep on it
You'll be giving up your Jesus piece to your peeps to pawn it
For legal fees in the penal dorm
Screamin' on the horn with 'bout 30 years on your conscience
I'm watchin' brothers disappear, it's appallin'
Some dudes had just only a year of ballin'
Counter-intelligence found a strange evidence
(When the block is hot)
Still we behind the wheel with heat on us, hangin' with predicates
Position we placed in caves in, so they got us caged in
Waves spinnin' like Mike Bivens from New Edition agin'
(I gotta... when the block is hot)
I got families I'm feedin', 'cause my mans is bleedin'
Every five seconds look in all directions
I come through prepared, I give 'em a call
"I'm close, bring them guns downstairs"

[Chorus: Mark B. Mayfield (Nas)]
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination to change the situation
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot (hold it down)
I gotta use my imagination to change the situation

[Verse 2: Nas (Mark B. Mayfield)]
Uh, uh, it's beef week, Monday, murder
Two niggas dead, Tuesday
Wednesday and Thursday is hearse-day
Friday, somebody-gotta-die day
Saturday, put the gat away
Chillin' with your chick and a bag of haze
Wonderin' how it's all gon' end and what type of way
'Cause Sunday back to gunplay
Most shit start over nothin'
And get finished quick cause the art of repercussion
Yeah, I seen it, a G going out indecent (when the block is hot)
Takin' a plea agreement, thinkin' he secret
Escape the crime scene, now you live straight like 9:15
Then one-time intervene (I gotta hold...)
My man ain't like me sayin' I don't care if I die
But the SIG Sauer on me now I'm scared to die
You thinkin' the one I send to clap you be a shorty
But he old school, holdin' a .38, he in his 40s

[Chorus: Mark B. Mayfield (Nas)]
I gotta hold down the block when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination to change the situation
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot (yeah, word to mother)
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation (yeah)

[Verse 3: Nas (Mark B. Mayfield)]
(I gotta...) Anytime brothers can't get jobs, then they rob
A man rather die than live on his knees and starve
Cops steady askin' your man what happened
First he tell, then he stop, like he not really rattin'
Guess he not really in that casket from a sawed-off
(When the block is hot)
Listen, peep game from the brain of an all-star
The rain hurt niggas' bones who been shot
Metal pins in their leg, they walk with a limp-hop
The streets lie (when the block is hot), so you better be cautious
Your man'll fry you plus everybody talkin'
A vet, a General, don't step where I walked in
Make your own path, be a legend in your skin
(Hold down the block, when the block is hot)
Make your own cash, don't stress what I'm flossin'
Don't expect more when you put in less work than all them
Queensbridge projects has taught him
And that's for life, you heard me right, I got the block

[Outro: Mark B. Mayfield]
When the block is hot, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination to change the situation
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination to change the situation
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination to change the situation



[Intro: Chrisette Michele]
Hip Hop
It will never die
Hip Hop
It will never, never die

[Verse 1: Nas]
Ghetto nigga strutting, with nothing but dreams in Queens broke
Mac-10s, you can smell the PCP smoke
Melle Mel told it real, in the music he wrote
Those were the days I remember, we used to be close
Then I was nine, coldest winter I remember
Was slipping in December, two feet of snow
Yeah, that's the East Coast, that black ice
Symbolize the rap life, it was slick and smooth
I understood I had to come from the hood
Doing the Pee Wee Herman, the Smurf
Before them phones chirped
The block's drugs flowing, didn't have your own work
You had to have somebody else's, a small chrome on your pelvis
Starter jacket, Blue Georgetown or Green Celtic
Your girl's too expensive, she want shellfish
Red Lobster was popping, standing on that line forever
I wish someone would step on my Bally leathers
Now it's whatever
Hip Hop's forever

Kept my radio on 98 or BLS
Had a pre-pubescent lyric gift, but niggas never hear me spit
My little brother tried to warn them, I was a tornado coming
He knew from the inside like the eye of a storm, and told my pops about it
He gave us tickets to that Wild Style flick
Double Trouble retarded, we was the proudest
I never had a summer job
Sweeping leaves, socks to my knees
Home-made shorts, cut off Lee's
I ain't work a day in my life
Wiping away eraser off the paper, man
I'm just trying to say it right
Big radio, tape's slowing down
Lower the lights go, battery dead
I got to freeze them 'till they're ice cold
In the freezer later, I'm staring at the speaker
Sunk in them 808s deeper, cleaning my sneakers
With the bristles of a toothbrush, soap and water
I let the shoestrings soak in water

[Outro: Nas (Chrisette Michele)]
(Live Hip Hop, Live) Ain't got nothing to do with Old School
(Live Hip Hop, Live) New School, Dirty South
(Give Hip Hop, Give) West Coast, East Coast, this about us
(Give Hip Hop, Give) This our thing, you know what I'm saying
(Stay Hip Hop, Stay) This came from the gut, from the blood
(Stay Hip Hop, Stay) From the soul, right here, man
(I Pray Hip Hop, Pray) This is our thing, man
(I Pray Hip Hop, Stays) You know? so I say what I say

(Live Hip Hop, Live) And I say what I say, and I mean it
(Live Hip Hop, Live) Y'all take it how you want to take it
(Give Hip Hop, Give) Because if you asking: "Why is Hip Hop dead?"
(Give Hip Hop, Give) It's a pretty good chance, you the reason it died, man
(Stay Hip Hop, Stay) It's a pretty good, chance your lame ass, corny ass
(Stay Hip Hop, Stay) Is the reason it died, man
(I Pray Hip Hop, Pray) You don't give a fuck about it, you don't know nothing about it
(I Pray Hip Hop, Stays) You want this paper, be a hustler

(Live Hip Hop, Live) You a hustler, you ain't a rapper, get your paper man
(Live Hip Hop, Live) You know what I'm saying, but this rap shit is real
(Give Hip Hop, Give) Bitch, this shit is real: bitch
(Give Hip Hop, Give) *laughs*
(Stay Hip Hop, Stay)
(Live)
(Stay Hip Hop, Stay)
(Live)
(I Pray Hip Hop, Pray)
(Give)
(I Pray Hip Hop, Stays)

(Live Hip Hop, Live)
(Stay)
(Live Hip Hop, Live)
(Give Hip Hop, Give)
(Give Hip Hop, Give)
(Stay Hip Hop, Stay)
(Stay Hip Hop, Stay)
(I Pray Hip Hop, Pray)
(I Pray Hip Hop, Stays)



[Intro: Nas]
Dre, he a Compton-Compton OG
Nas, he a QB-QB true G
Do the history

[Verse 1: Nas]
Way before The Firm, like back in the day
Nas was the first New York nigga rappin' with Dre
So of course I got a track to bring it back to your face
The one kid that would've been Aftermath that got away
But we still get together, like, every several years
To sprinkle a little bit of Heaven for your ears
Relax, sippin' Cliquot in Rio, stupid fuckers
Low-key, no G's, but it's still Gucci luggage
I love Cape Cod, and watching fly bitches with gray eyes
Wrestle in a tub of KY to get my day by
I like to celebrate, why? Cause I can vision
Collages and images of my lies with no regret to hate
So every breath I take is all about the rules
It's hard for you to breathe, like you at high altitude
So crack the Patron, it's on heathens
The God's back, hard body, Mr. Jones never leavin'

[Hook: Marsha]
Hustlers, dealers, drop-top riders
Make that cake, cop two five fivers
Pimps and players, platinum diamonds
East to West Coast, we riders

[Bridge: Nas + (Game)]
He a Compton-Compton OG
(Mix that with a QB-QB true G, what you got's)
A concoction of some different ghetto blocks
(West Coast kill the tracks, East Coast gunshots)

[Verse 2: Game]
1995, eleven years from today
I'm in the record shop with choices to make
Illmatic on the top shelf, The Chronic on the left, homie
Wanna cop both but only got a 20 on me
So fuck it, I stole both, spent the 20 on a dub sack
Ripped the package off Illmatic and bumped that
For my niggas it was too complex when Nas rhymed
I was the only Compton nigga with a "New York State of Mind"
Inside the dope house, bottlin' up sherm
Bangin' The Firm, Dre was king then so I waited my turn
Fast forward, now I'm making 'em burn
Ended my peers' careers
Hollered at Nas, a hard lesson was learned
So I reconciled my differences like he did with Jigga
I stopped beefin' with niggas, cause I'm "Ether" to niggas
Comb the earth 'til there's no one left
If I ruled the world I summons all you weak rap niggas to death

[Bridge: Nas + (Game)]
He a Compton-Compton OG
(Mix that with a QB-QB true G, what you got's)
A concoction of some different ghetto blocks
(West Coast kill the tracks, East Coast gunshots)

[Hook: Marsha]
Hustlers, dealers, drop-top riders
Make that cake, cop two five fivers
Pimps and players, platinum diamonds
East to West Coast, we riders

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, the Jordans sportin', come off the dice game
With a fortune walkin', you a walking coffin'
The musket, I tucked it, you bluff it, I bust it
You're sideways talking, so I lay often
I wait patient, to duct tape hatin'
Fuck ass niggas, get bucked ass niggas
Pluck ashes of Cuban cigars, you foolin' with Nas
That's my name and I came with Rugers this time
And if I'm sane that Soul Plane movie's the bomb
Word to my mom's name tattooed to my arm
You can't revolve me, embalm me, calm me or harm me
Rob me or dodge these bullets I'm busting
See that's malarky you yappin'
I open up the tripod to put the gatling on, and I start clappin'
Nasty man, from bagging grams and runnin' from cops
To a mil on the hand, a mil on the watch, I'm fuckin' with Doc

[Hook: Marsha]
Hustlers, dealers, drop-top riders
Make that cake, cop two five fivers
Pimps and players, platinum diamonds
East to West Coast, we riders



[Verse 1]
Man, Prince was a pimp, appolonia vanity
Sheila E. had me on the edge of insanity
Swore if I made it in music I'd be similar
Here I am, this is the future, I'm where the woman are
Rocking with Tim and Bob, y'all need me, shine a spotlight up
In the sky like Batman, I pops right up
This is Nas hate if u must hate been hot since the days of cassette tapes
T-shirts over the thermals dripped in our memories
Sipping that Hennessey .45th in my denim jeans
She told me she was my eyelashes
When we hump, I grunt just like a bull mastiff
They call me the best who ever did it
Only in the club one minute guess who I slip with
A chocolate dike ghetto thing sweet
We going to pop tonight, bon appetite

[Hook]
Do you know who I am? And she says
La lalala I already know
What we can't hold hands? And she says
La lalala I already know
You got to leave by three? you with me?
La lalala I already know
So until next week? you know, ma
La lalala I already know

[Verse 2]
You know, mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the nastiest sexiest thug of them all?
I seen her in the mall, she was wearing home
Degarsole keyoke mose cherry cologne
She was looking very alone
'Til this big weightlifting Mr. Universe clone starts grabbing her own
But she can't stop looking im in the zone
One look at the kid she taking of her stone
Cash crazy ass crazy hair long
And baby amaze me because im in rare form
She like an ice cold bowl of post honeycomb
Followed me in the shop while I cop Nina Simone
Tap me on the shoulder I told her I her im on the phone
I played it off well nobody was on the cell
Shit, she said the tone?
She said mister so and so should I leave you alone?
I said

[Hook]

Tick-tock, tick-tock time is passing
Hello?
Turn the television off, focus here

[Verse 3]
You know, lover not a fighter
I'm the vagina liner reconstructor, bed sheet ruffler
For you freak girls undercover who loves ya?
I'm not a priest don't front for me, but step in my confessional
That's the bedroom, tell the truth I'll be impressional
Wait before you pass your collection plate
Show me you a professional so we straight?
She tried to kiss my lips, but no I don't do that
Want me to kiss my lips but not with a new jack
Few stacks spend my chips, yeah I do that
See the problem with you women is, look I got 'em
You can hear a mouse piss on cotton
You don't want to miss it then listen, stop stressing the man
We out to get as much sex as we can
And you roll wit the plan, shorty you lie
But you got to leave, 2:45

[Intro]
La la
La la, la la, la la la la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la la la la

[Sample 1: Live at the Barbeque]
Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage

[Sample 2: Halftime]
Nas, why did you do it
You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime

Check me out y'all

[Sample 3: It Ain't Hard to Tell]
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell

[Sample 4: The World is Yours]
It's yours
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?

I sip the Dom P, watching Gandhi til I'm charged
Then writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin

[Sample 5: One Love]
One what?
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Sample 6: The Message]
Fake thug, no love
You get the slug CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though

[Sample 7: Street Dreams]
QB since 1933
Street dreams are made of these

Everybody's looking for something

[Sample 8: If I Ruled the World]
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read "The World Is Mine"

If I ruled the world (Imagine that)

[Skit]
[Horse]: Yo Jungle, how you feel about that Nas shit?
[Jungle]: Niggas heard that shit, man, the fuck is that, man? Sorry man, y-you gotta play that shit to niggas man, niggas know what the fuck time it is man.

Niggas with real-real motherfucking money, niggas with real motherfucking things on their minds man, word is bond man. [?] bitch ass niggas man (Horse: Fucking faggot emcees). Fucking weirdos man, y'all weirdos out there man. Fuck all of y'all niggas. Yeah man y'all niggas can write what y'all want. Suck my motherfucking dick. You're-you're a bitch! What the fuck y'all want, man. Listen to this gangster shit, this is gangster. Real shit! How 'bout that? For the Nas, man. [?] Drugs, man
[Horse]: Fuck all y'all faggot motherfuckers



[Hook: Children's Choir]
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 1]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold their breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 2]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be) (Now, go)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 3]
Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young Princess when you get your wedding ring
Your man is saying "She's my Queen"

[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Outro]
Save the music, y'all
Save the music, y'all
Save the music, y'all
Save the music, y'all
Save the music

[Produced by Salaam Remi]



[Hook : Kids]
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be

I know I can (I know I can!)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!)
I'll be where I wanna be

[Verse 1 : Rakim]
I'm from the home of a million legends and trend settin
A lot of footsteps to follow, I've been steppin
Mind stressin tryin to find direction, crime spreading
Time precious, I ain't have rest since 9/11
I live fast, hustle like today is my last
I get cash, the struggle's like a day on the Ave
Crack, D and raw, gats squeezin off
Manhattan streets in awe from casualties of war
The eve of the Apocalypse, evil people in politics
Every block is at risk, the metropolitan metropolis
The opposite of Liza Minelli and Frank Sinatra
Alicia Keys, Nas and Ra the gangsta's opera
So New York City walk with me, talk gritty
It's up to us New York it's our city
Here the man come with the anthem, hands up
It's time the thrill is back New York, let's stand up

[Hook : Kids]
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be

I know I can (I know I can!)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!)

[Verse 2 : Nas]
For brothers who died from black-on-black violence
From here to the Dark Continent were rebels sell diamonds
To clients all over the world, got little Black girls dyin'
And can we please pour some more liquors?
For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy -- my niggas
Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan
It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on
Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets
And I promise through rhymin' Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest
And can we please have a moment of truth?
For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots
And families back home who pray they make it home safe
Hopin' that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles
This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you
Mommy I'm still here, wishin' I was there with you
Let's take 'em home

[Hook : Kids]
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be

I know I can (I know I can!)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!)

[Verse 3 : 2Pac]
I want money in large amounts, my garage full of cars that bounce
Movin' my tapes in major ways cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They runnin' off at the mouth 'til I fill it up with my pump
They jump, my automatic keep 'em wary
Why you frontin' like you Billy bad-ass, nigga you scary
I've been knowin' you for years, we was high school peers, in junior high
I was itchin' to kill, and you was, ready to die
While you bullshittin', niggas was dyin' and catchin' cases
Bustin' my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
Leavin' no trace, they see my face and they buried
Them bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride, and I'mma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfuckers die
It's not the way I wanna live, my nigga it's how it is
Homey got into a fight last night, that killed his kids
In this life I lead

[Hook : Nas + Kids]
I know I can (I know I can!)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!)

[Hook : Kids]
I know I can (I know I can!)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!)

[Bridge : Kids]
Ooohh

[Outro : Nas]
Save the music y'all, save the music y'all
Save the music y'all, save the music y'all
Save the music



[Intro: Marsha Amborious (Nas)]
Oooh oooh, oooooooooooooooohhhhhhhh! The struggles of life! (Life!)
Oooh, oooh, oooh, da da da da da da! (Everything I ever wanted)
Oh, oh (Yeah Yeah!) Do do do do do do! (Yeah! My life, so real)

[Verse 1: Nas]
Before I use to dream I could rule the world
Now it's thorough I survived the perils in my fly apparel
Seven forty five appeal, no candy paint no chrome wheels
I Close deals tried to see my face on my own bills
The president here, he's honest and fair
Prayed for the days, when the kins of slaves is honered and shared
January 20th I was there
I'm aware the part I played to get young voters to care
Recession is a blessin in disguise
For a new economy to rise somethin old has to die
I'm still sippin' Rose' PJ's it be's like that
I brung the eighty seven Fila's back
Save collect, B.I.G.'S dream came correct
Tryin' to push seven hundreds, they made them yes
I used to think United College Fund was for bums (Nah)
The ghetto advocate for education look what I become

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosious {Nas}]
Before I use to dream I ruled the world
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}
So here I am, to rule the world, world
But now you used to dream you ruled the world
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)
{I use to dream} (Ruled the world)
So here we are, are, are, are (Yeah! Here we are!)

[Verse 2: Nas]
I don't say I'm maintainin', that's a lame's language (word)
Poor English, from a wise man I learned patience
Me not distinguished, is like a fiendless Queensbridge
I don't say I'm grindin', cause everything I do is redefining
Cause when you know the streets to the science
Apply it very moderate, 'til your business'll watch you profit
Rap game, NBA to NFL, the kids'll yell, "Will I win? "
The fella ends up in the cell - nonsense
Cause they can grow to be part of the Congress
Be responsive, to these inner-city problems
Behind a tent with a chauffeur, I rep for the culture
Rep for the thugs and STILL see eye to eye with Oprah
I was a dreamer a wisher would hope for
A better life for these kids while I sip on a Mosa
I plan yo, you should watch the black and white's hand, yo
Who's the best? Next to me, they couldn't light a candle
Yep!

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosious {Nas}]
Before I use to dream I ruled the world
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}
So here I am, to rule the world, world
But now you used to dream you ruled the world
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)
{I use to dream} (I Ruled the world)
So here we are, are, are, are (Arrrrreeeeeeee!)

[Bridge: Marsha Ambrosious (Nas)]
You can be who you wanna, say what you wanna (Marsha!)
Tryna make it better, our sons and our daughters (Yeah!)
Use your mind - make a change
Yes, we can - see a brighter day
Gon' be struggle, gon' be pain
But no excuses to be made
This is the time that we've been waiting foooooooooor!

[Verse 3: Nas]
I done seen it all, I got it on with the weak and strong
There's no relief, it's like the beef keeps keepin on
I can't count the amount I drew heaters on
Cause we was warrin in the Ps', it was Vietnam
Now I got you in arenas, watchin me perform
The songs rappin 'bout them same beefs and the street I'm from
Thankful, for the art form I'm eatin from
I never see no losses, I only see we won - yeah

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosious {Nas}]
Before I use to dream I ruled the world
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}
So here I am, to rule the world, world
But now you used to dream you ruled the world
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)
{I use to dream} (I Ruled the world)
So here we are, are, are, are (Here we are this day!)
Before I use to dream I ruled the world
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}
So here I am, to rule the world, world
But now you used to dream you ruled the world
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)
{I use to dream} (Oh we come so far!)
So here we are, are, are, are (Here we are this day!)

[Intro: Nas]
Life, I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know

[Verse 1: Nas]
Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin'
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue Bahama waters, no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage
We'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin', fashion, designer clothes
Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read "The World Is Mine"

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Verse 2: Nas]
The way to be, paradise life, relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controllin', click rollin'
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holdin'
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
And reverse fiends to Willies
It sounds foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

[Verse 3: Nas]
You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down out of state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit(i)
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love 'em love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Outro: Lauryn Hill]
If I ruled the world, if I ruled
If I ruled, I'd free all my sons
Black diamonds, I love 'em love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
I love 'em love 'em baby!!

[Intro]
Damn
Look how muh-fuckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggas just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me, right
Like I'm a f-, I'm a gun, shit
It's like I'm a motherfucking gun
I can't believe this shit
Word up, word up

[Verse 1]
I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab me and bullets spray
They use me wrong so I sing this song 'til this day
My body is cold steel for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, living harshly
Beat up and battered they pull me out
I watch as niggas scattered, making me kill
But what I feel it never mattered
When I'm empty I'm quiet, finding myself fiending to be fired
A broken safety, niggas place me in shelves
Under beds so I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keeping me full up with hollow heads

[Chorus]
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

[Verse 2]
Always I'm in some shit
My abdomen is the clip, the barrel is my dick uncircumcised
Pull my skin back and cock me
I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggas shock me
I see niggas bleeding running from me in fear, stunningly tears
Fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys, for years
I've been used in robberies, giving niggas heart to follow me
Placing peoples in graves, funerals made cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up TEC with numbers on his chest that say
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
Had a serial defaced, hoping one day police would place
Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo, I had some other plans like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand

[Chorus]
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

[Verse 3]
Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a nine
There's a grenade in a box, and that TEC that kept crying
Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year he's rusty, it's clear
He's bout to fall to pieces cause of his murder career
Yo I can hear somebody coming in, open the shelf
His eyes bubbling, he said it was on
I felt his palm troubled him shaking
Somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting
My creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally go off, making niggas memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said, "Remember me?"
He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggas is waiting in hell for him
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor his wig split so fast
I didn't know he was hit, it's over with
Heard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me
Damn!

[John Lennon]
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us, only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today

[Rap Verse 1: Nas]
Imagine we could all get along
Won't be long
Til that day comes
Mothers, stop cookin', take off your aprons
Father, stop lookin' at every sports station
Take a second
And think of every poor nation
Making weapons
They can't afford a plate, no proper healthcare
Over here in Section 8, a lot on welfare
Yo, the wealthy laugh, the market crash, economy's bad
How did we change it, newsflash about a power that's dangerous
How do we escape these brainless acts of terror
I'd tell you now, if Jesus ever comes, it'll not be better
Put our hearts in the right place
Humans of all colors
We stand up as one race, I promise you, one day
Imagine that

[John Lennon]
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion, too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

[Hook: John Legend]
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

[Rap Verse 2: Pitbull]
America, the
Land of the free
America, the
Land of opportunity
America
What's the point of having a Statue Of Liberty
If you turnin' refugees, back at sea
Music was made to move them
Even the devil he dances
I got a lot of questions
And I'm searching for answers
We taught to believe in religion, but religion's
The reason the Twin Towers are missin'
Listen
That was the past, but maybe now, you realize
The man above us the only thing
That keeps us alive
We breathe the same air
We bleed the same blood
Imagine our people treated equal, imagine one love (One love)

[John Lennon]
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

[Repeat Hook]



[Produced by Jae Supreme]

[Intro: Nas & Jae Supreme]
Yo, Nas whattup?
Whattup kid?
What going on Ill
I'm just tryna tell these brothers where I'm coming from
You know what I'm saying
Alright, kick it

[Verse 1]
I'm the nigga walking with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testing
Gimme a Smith-N-Wesson I'll have niggas undressing
I'm rolling with a mob and running from the cops
Drive stolen cars and shoot many Glocks
A marijuana addict, if niggas want static
They had it, 'cause I flip just like an acrobatic
I'm always on the corners rolling up Sess
When I dress it's never nothing less than Guess
So I walk with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
I got it going on, my knuckle game is strong
Sip Dom Prignon and then carry on
Army certifieds, keep a Rent-A-Ride
Stripping mad hoes and kick em to the side
See I'm the type of brother who keeps a four-pounder
Start a lot of shit and shoot at out-of-towners
At every block party, I try to catch a body
All for props, tell your pops call the cops
See now I'm on the run, but still having fun
Living by the MAC, my gear is all black
I keep killing because I'm ready and I'm willing and I'm a villain

[Hook]
What?
What?
Wha-a-a-t?

[Verse 2]
I got beef with the President and still loving it
Trying to make plans to overthrow the government
It won't work cause niggas don't believe enough
They'd rather stand on the corners and receive a cuff
Around they wrist, you don't like the sound of this
Rebel, but my country doesn't want me
They'd rather hunt me but you'll never catch us all
While you fucking with the dealers we'll be sticking up the malls
Full of anger, all about danger
Pulling out my banger, stabbing up a stranger
I hear Walkie Talkies in my sleep
And use a whole lot of slang when I speak
Walking with a vest, the projects is where I rest
And the streets keep me stressed
Staring at your face, wait for you to make a sound
That's when I take you down, shoot you up and suit you up
All in black and put you in a box
A hard rock with a .25 in my socks
Aiming at your temple so take the diamonds off your hands
I'm buckwild like Billy Bear and Ganz
Prince of pistoleers, words are crystal clear
And this you should fear
The maniac keeps killing, I'm known as a outlaw 'cause I'm a villain

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I keep bullets racing out the barrels of a Magnum
Put 'em to sleep and leave the doctors to tag them
An outlaw, although I never wear a holster
In every town you see my face is on a poster
Hear so many gunshots my eardrums should pop
Eyesight should stop from seeing mad niggas drop
To the concrete, I got police putting chalk on the street
And this is done once a week
I'm out to kill like Navy Seals
I'm crazy ill and what I can't do my .380 will
I never play with a AK
Because I'm fine with a .9 and if caught I'll do lesser time
Sometimes you gotta plan shit and understand it
See I'm a bandit whose hand'll itch
Without a gun in it, Nas is running it
I stay blunted, I'm the project's most wanted
My voice is like magic
My cassette is the clip and your radio's the Automatic
So when I'm in your town, "duck down"
Or take fire, whatever you desire
But I'm on point you might miss
Never fight this, you'll be sightless when I strike this
So roll the dice, I'm stopping the bank
It's ill how I got the pen dropping the ink
No one can stop this apocalypse
On your record player a method layer so run and tell your Mayor
Nas the parlayer, you better say your prayer
I'm the New York City slayer
I play high post and then lay low
Parl slow and wear horns, not a halo
And keep killing 'cause I'm a villain



The year is 1994 and New Years is creeping up upon us. An MC from Queensbridge named Nas is currently keeping the streets on fire from coast to coast. Many brothers on the block, as well as Rap critics acknowledge Nas debut  LP Illmatic to be one of the greatest solo debuts of all time

Keep in mind, this after the riots. I think the O.J. Simpson trial was still on everybody's mind. Race, poverty and conflict were framing a lot of what was in America and Hip-Hop. I originally did this for a magazine called 4080. In its time, 4080 was a force of nature. I remember Harry Allen telling me how much he loved it. But the owner had addiction problems that forced it to close

Nas was  a legend already because of his verse on Live at the BBQ. I was already a fan. I did this interview at the 4080 offices on a speaker phone. The interview was not seen again until it was republished in the book Lyrical Swords Vol. 2: Westside Rebellion in 2006. When Jay Z and Nas settled their differences, it was partially reprinted on Allhiphop.com. This is the first time

AB: What were your earliest memories of Hip-Hop? Not much being a part of it- but just the music itself and the culture?

Nas: I remember it just bein the fly shit, the new shit. Just niggas, Black people, young Black people, loud music, big speakers, turntables, females, weed, Private Stock, and seeing records. Like, if somebody was a big name, you saw he made a record. I mean, it was mad rappers. But when you look at a niggas record  you seen that was some shit! As being a young Black man, you would have never thought to see yourself on some wax. And that tight there, you was the man. You was chillin. Even if a n***a never knew you, if they see you on record you was the man

AB: So what was the first Hip-Hop album you bought?

Nas: I think it was Run-DMC King of Rock. If it wasn't that, it was LL Cool Js Radio. Those were the first ones I bought. The other ones, I stole out my mans crate

AB: What were the first ones you stole?

Nas: The first one I stole was I think, Mary Jane Girls. I consider that Hip-Hop

AB: I understand you used to break back in the day?

Nas: Yo, that was a long time ago. I'd rather not talk about it. We all did it

AB: I used to do that for a minute. So tell me about your youth. What was your relationship like with your father?

Nas: He was just a cool muthafucka. He was different from what I would visualize: a father being when you would look down and watch a [show] like Cosby Show. He was different than that type of shit. But hes just a cool n***a  a straight up and down person

AB: And your mother?

Nas: My moms is real strong, real sensitive, real caring and real intelligent

AB: Do you have any business plans?

Nas: Ill Will music, dedicated to my man Ill Will. Bless the dead. He would probably be spinnin for me right now on the turntables or chillin with me cause he was my right hand man. But now hes still here with me, spiritually

AB: We all know a lot of Black men that have lost their lives needlessly. What do you think are the reasons for the havoc coast to coast?

Nas: Its just that we're naturally born Black and aggressive towards getting what we deserve. Were born knowing that something is missing. We're born feeling like we're born in an alien nation. From day one, your moms and what she goes through. I mean just, just, generations. Its what your parents have already been through. Really, it depends on how your family structure is. If your moms is on dope, and your pops ain't there, you gonna grow up real strong in certain ways and real fucked up in certain ways. But if your moms is there and your pops is there but they are just weak people who didn't know how to guide you If you're the kind of person who takes things upon yourself, then you're gonna be a different way. You know its all kinds of ways we come out. Its so many of us that are around each other. So much s**t on our minds. We're thinking we're tyrants trying to get to the right solution. We're thinking about all the different ways of getting it and its mad obstacles in our way. Its mad shit that we don't see in our way that makes us fall. Its so easy for us to f**k up, especially when you are coming from a poor family

AB: On Main Sources Live at the BBQ you had a line that said When I was 12 I went to hell for snuffin Jesus. I'm not a Christian, but the fact that a man would make a casual remark like that about the murder of an acknowledged Prophet to some and saviour by others- what brings lines like that out?

Nas: When I'm feeling up to a point where Im on some shit where I just don't give a shit bout nobody. Cause ain't nothin in my pocket. Im going through some shit, Ill diss anybody I want to. I'll tell you why. I could break the s**t down for you. Because when a person is that angry, thats how he feels about everything. Thats how I felt lyrically at the time

AB: Reminds me of Malcolm X, in the movie when he yells to the priest You tell Jesus to kiss my ass! What has he done for me. He ain't done nothin for me!

Nas: I kinda felt like how Malcolm X felt. And this was before the movie, I just thought of Malcolm when I said that. You know what I mean? I knew he would be behind me

AB: Are you coming to the West Coast any time soon?

Nas: True indeed. I plan on coming out there with the Queens shit, the inner side of Queens material. Its a lot of punk muthaf**kas that never say Queens and shit

AB: Why do you think that is?

Nas: I dont know, to tell you the truth. I don't know. It just became like a religion for some rappers not to mention Queens. But Im from Queensbridge, and Im just representing. Its all about the bridge with me

AB: Its funny to me because some of my earliers memories are from Queens rappers

Nas: B.D.P. put a cease to that shit

AB: Is that what it is? do you think they had an influence on that whole angle?

Nas: KRS ONE was so ill. He just came out and destroyed shit. A lot of rappers from Queens just couldnt fuck with him. Or, at the time as just trying to concentrate on their career. You know, getting money or whatever. There wasnt really a lot of battling rappers accept LL Cool J

AB: So what kind of angle were you trying to come on with this album?

Nas: I just wanted to speak. I just wanted to be the voice of a nation

AB: I saw a quote from a Hip-Hop magazine where you said you wanted to be the first Black President

Nas: Word up!

AB: How do you plan to get there?

Nas: Its so many tricks. So much shit. The people, the politicians, the government. The government is ill. They on some old Illmatic shit. They are just like the slave masters but more modern. They have different goals. The world is different now. They just on some new shit. Its about who got game, whos smart and moves first

AB: When I look at the Declaration of Independence, America is nothing more than an Idea that has never really been put into practice

Nas: True indeed

AB: Like Disneyland. Where everybody is supposed to be happy. But it does not exist

Nas: I might have to quote you on that one day. Wise words

AB: Thank you brother. Can America happen? Or do you think America is just a concept?

Nas: As long as they keep living those ideals and shit. and trying to do that, I think yes. Cause America is cool right now as long as you know what you gotta do. Like that nigga Don King will tell you in a minute. He s a Black man and hes paid. So that means you can get that dough. Straight up and down. It's some good here

AB: I was recently reading a book by Dennis Kimbro called Think and Grow Rich. He quotes a guy named S.B. Fuller who says that Poverty is a state of mind.I thought it was profound. I wondered if you agreed with that

Nas: Hmmm. Yeah, in ways. In ways

AB: In which ways is it not?
Nas: I mean, poverty is just reality. There is real poverty. You know what Im saying? I dont know. That shit is deep

AB: What human being had the most influence on you as a person?

Nas: Malcolm X and N.W.A

AB: Stay strong, and well be in contact in the future

Nas: Alright, god. One Love

[Nas]
Peace, how are you?
I ain't mean to be late
It was my night to watch my little girl
It's chilly out here
What happened? You crying?
Y'all got into it again huh?
See you gotta let them know from the jump
I don't care who they are, or who they're with
Yeah I know they know we're talking
Shh, why don't they just leave us alone?
I know it's hard for them to understand people like us
Could love each other
Come on, stop crying now
Oh, there's something I gotta tell you
I heard they're watching you
Yeah, they're watching, they're watching me too
But there ain't no reason to get low
I'm proud, I'm here
You know I'ma stand up for you, no matter what
And I know you'll stand up for me
I don't have no doubts about you being true to me
The world is ours
But right now it feels like the whole world is against us
So study, be strong, don't cry no more

*Immediately follows A Message To The Feds, Sincerely, We The People*



[Intro: Nas]
INVASION!

[Spoken: Samples]
Watch closely. You are about to experience a nigga moment. Webster defines the nigga moment as a moment when ignorance overwhelms the mind of an otherwise logical Negro man.

What did you say, bitch nigga?

Die, nigga! *gunshot*

Brothers and sisters using the word nigga

Nigga, nigga, nigga

HES A NIGGER! HES A NIGGER!

I aint no nigga!

What kind of message are you hoping to send with with that new album?

FUCK THE NIGGERS! (Oh, my God!)

A NIGGER, LOOK! ITS A NIGGER!

How you call yourself a nigga and be proud of it?

Flatline!

There goes the neighborhood!



[Intro]
Yeah
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore I could see
Through my belly button window who I am...

[Verse 1]
I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist
Punching my mom's stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching 'cause I'm nervous, though my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, that my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo, developing eyes
Looking out my belly button window, my father sighs
On his face he wears a frown, and I'm wondering
If they even want me around, as I go back to spirit town
So I could rest longer before I come back down the chute again
In the near future when
Mom and pops could agree on this, was here before
But my mom saw her gynecologist, he dumped me off
First they want me, then turn around and say they don't
You got 120 days, do what y'all want
But as for me, coming back, this be the last time
Abort me, keep me or give me away, make up your minds

[Hook 4X: Nas]
I shot my way out my mom dukes

[Verse 2]
They must wanna keep me, 'cause 4 months passed, I'm still alive
Guess I got what they call Ill Will to survive
When I look hard, the lights is killing my eyes
I know when mom's laying down, I get bored, start to get live
Move side to side, hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm, that's no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food, flowing through my mother's tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me
But month 3 was closer, see
That's when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved, he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my mom's voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered if I am born, will I be safe at all
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get out, and grow up and take charge
Month 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
Septemeber 14th, '73
Get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me
Arms open 'cause they know when I drop, a lot of shit's gonna stop
See how the goverment will start re-training cops
Month 9, I'm a week overdue, the labor induced
Pops told my moms "Push, and take deep breaths, too"
"Stay calm," holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything is blurry, my first breath screamed out
Tears pouring down my pop's face, he's so proud
Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he said "At least that nigga ain't ugly!"
Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body, she loved me
And, yo, I plan to over throw the devil
And y'all bout to see this world in trouble
Motherfuckers...

[Verse 1]
It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a cometinvasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'
Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Mot with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 2]
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 3]
This rhythmatic explosion
Is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep? Well, let me try again
Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas' raps should be locked in a cell; it ain't hard to tell



[Intro:]
Take it to the bridge
To the motherfuckin' bridge
Queensbridge in the motherfucker

[Hook:] x3
It Ain't Hard to Tell

[Verse 1:]
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up

School a fool well, you feel it like Braille, it ain't hard to tell
I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill

Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze like her-on in your nose
Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell

[Hook:] x3

[Verse 2:]
What's a beat if the rap don't click
I spit rhymes like I'm sick, dying loss in a pit
The only way I can escape is by vocals
Verbalize a strife
Stabbin' ears like a knife hood like
The Prophet of the gutter
Lyrics are silk mega butter
I flow never stutter
Clever poetic brothers on a mission
Dissin' all who perps the fraud
Scrams listen, (and) do what the experts record
Burn your pen and pads, mics you'll need not
Well I be packin' like a rasta in a weed spot
Hittin' your hearts like a hollow tip
Verbally illin' minds manipulated
My raps a nickel-plated
I illustrate it, X-rated, then move out
Nas the parlayer takes you on a new route
It's suicide poetry released from a cell
With immense clientele, I excel
It ain't hard to tell

[Hook:] x3

[Verse 3:]
Now, I'm blessed with the finesse to express like Shakespeare
The blocks "Cape Fear" drop metaphors when the breaks clears
My mic check is life or death, breathing a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like the Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket lining
Hit the Earth like a comet  invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazing
Cause in my physical, I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell

[Spoken: Nas]
Thank you, for giving me 20 years
Thank you, thank you
So, we now conclude with the final song of Illmatic
This one is the end of the cassette
It was just 9 songs
Yeah, this song right here, I got you though
This one my joint 'cause I'm a big Michael Jackson fan and he
I'll tell you something that I never said
For my album cover, you see me with the afro, that was kinda inspired by Michael Jackson, the little, the little kid picture, right?
So, I never told that anyone before
So, this is uhh, "It Ain't Hard To Tell"
The sample's from "Human Nature"
Yeah, I see y'all right here
Yeah

If you was there with me in '94, make some noise
I love you for that

[Verse 1]
Buckets like Gilligan
Still I peep reptilians in the Filligan
Blendin' in, my quintillion ton brain
Got me revealing men
Quintessential Queensbridge poet back to the grill again
Did songs with Chubb Rock to Chris Brown, switch styles
Yet to see any heavyweight make it to this round
This that pure champion sound, I wear the crizzown
Raw, one take, I don't even need a mixdown
Demure, not docile, volatile, I kick down
Amphibians, reptiles that make that hiss sound
They eyes change color, their pupils start to slit down
When I take cover, and I let off a fifth round

[Chorus]
I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends
Rest in peace to B.I., the shit never ends
B.I.G. shit
I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)
The world's going crazy, this shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)

[Verse 2]
Stop waiting for the hood to 'preciate ya
Whoever gets love in the hood, he's a freak of nature
When I said I wasn't mainstream, lames scream
"What does he mean?
Who does he think he is?
His bank be hid, he hardly out
He still as hard as he was when he started out"
We count 'em out, we count 'em in
Amongst the real, never my crown in doubt
So around my house with my wiz, lessons I got from my friends
Do they love me for me or love me for them?

[Chorus]
I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends
The world's out war, the shit never ends
Everybody packin'
I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)
It never ends, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)
What will it take to end?

[Verse 3]
Can't see me moving, I'm like the fastest
I'm a 3D movie, no need of glasses
They hate it before they hear it
Clear that my perseverance is somethin' they can't bear
It's become apparently clear
They fear me, I'm not dying or rather
Put my ears to the blaring cop siren
Am I here or in a hot dryer?
Didn't hear all that pop-soundin' fakespeare, pop rhymin'
Niggas should stop lyin'
Why in a whole year, you still in the same spot trying
To change, but you not risin'?
When will somebody real tell him he not Nas-in'
Cars, you just started drivin'
I've been ridin', been made it
You and your pretend stages
I did this since windbreakers (Windbreakers)



[Verse 1: Nas]
Born in NYC beastin', the lord left me no choice
Christian pendants, Islamic thoughts, criminal courts
Father forgive, I wanna die like Godfather did
Standing in lineups I'm paying lawyers, ain't trying to bid
Alliances surveillance watching 'em careful when plottin'
My boys were captured on video, farewell to my partners
Ski masks and fake tags in case the car was spotted
Lavish hotels, Central Park West, fly apartments - let's rob it
Forensics get us sentenced so we the smartest
It's livest as Saturday night as I load up a cartridge
Let off the fully, got alibis, no need to worry
Done right, we don't see the prosecutors or grand jury
Reputed mobster style, take the money and run
Count it in warehouses, leave town and live 100 years like crocodiles
Straight up NYC like a Mets fitted
This a tower heist, even Donald Trump can get it

[Hook x2: Nas]
You want respect, money and power, right?
Well let's ride tonight; it's a tower heist

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I got my shades on, got my money in my pocket
Got my J's on, spend a hundred for my watch
I feel amaz-on, it's a jungle in these streets
Choppers be going "bang", your people need be deceased
Everyday is war, living legends you must applaud
So light my cigar, or for the foreigners living large
Dealin' straight raw, the Mercedes in my garage
Your girl on my dick and I may just feel like menage
I came for the cash, me and Nas behind the mask
Cause, bitch, it's a heist, give me ice or lose your life
My profit's so nice me and dog gon' count it twice
It's poppin' tonight, roll the weed, give me a light - UGH!

[Hook]

[Chorus]
I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president
I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin' congressman
I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president
I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin' congressman
Can I talk to ya?

[Verse 1]
Step up to the White House let me in
Whats my reason for being I'm ya next of kin
And we built this motherfucker
You wanna kill me because my hunger?
Mr. America young black niggas want ya
I wanna talk to the man, understand?
Understand this motherfuckin' G-pack in my hand
Look what happened to San Fran
Young girl hit by policeman
Twelve shots up in her dome, damn
Niggas thought we slept but the architect sent
The Pentagon's from Egypt, government secret
The 99 to 2-G computer shutdown, what now
Extension on Earth, human cutdown
Niggas play with PlayStations, they build a spacestations
On Mars plottin' civilizations
Dissin' us discriminatin' different races
Tax payers pay for more jail for Black Latin faces

[Chorus]
I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president
I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin' congressman
I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president
I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin' congressman
Can I talk to ya?

[Verse 2]
I'm just a black man why y'all made it so hard, damn
Niggas gotta go create his own job
Mr. Mayor imagine if this was your backyard
Mr. Governor imagine if it was your kids that starved
Imagine your kids gotta sling crack to survive
Swing a mack to be live cardiac to get high
It's the ghetto life, yeah I celebrate it I live it
And all I got is what you left me with I'ma get it
And y'all combinin' all the countries we goin' do the same
Combine all the cliques to make one gang
It ain't a black and white thing
It's to make the change, citizens of a higher plane

[Chorus]
I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president
I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin' congressman
I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president
I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin' congressman
Can I talk to ya?

[Verse 3]
What y'all waitin' for the world to blow up
Before you hear this rewind this 4 minutes before we timeless
Let y'all niggas bang my shit before Saddam hits
Let Nastradamus tell us what time it is
They try to buy us with dough
Fake black leaders of puppets always talkin' 'bout the city budget
The news got it all confused lyin' to the public
They eyes watchin' stay wise move above it
Water floods predicted, hurricanes, twisters
Its all signs of the Armageddon, three sixes
People reverse the system, politics verse religion
Holy war, muslim verse christians
Niggas in high places, they don't got the balls for this
People in power sit back and watch them slaughter us
Mr. President I assume it was negligence
But your streets are upside down, I'm here to represent

[Chorus]
I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president
I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin' congressman
I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president
I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin' congressman
Can I talk to ya?

[Outro]
Can I talk to you Mr. President
Niggas tryin to get with the computers
We ain't John Henry
Banging down fuckin'..? fighting against the machines
We want to be Part of the establishment nigga
That's what we are steppin up for
Ain't no cartoon out here
This shit is real
Total Package in this nigga
LES in this nigga
Ill Will nigga
Mr. President wanna keep us from establishment
Niggas are american baby
American Made



[Intro: Nas & Al Jarreau]
Melody, harmony, melody
Melody, harmony, melody, steadily
Melody, harmony, melody
Melody, harmony, melody, steadily

[Verse 1: Nas]
Everybody's not gon get you but keep going
I be cruising 40,000 feet like I'm a Boeing
Doubting me, they said I would have no longevity
Instead I'm steadily repping these fundamentals
I assemble these sentences
Cause someone said that I've been unadventurous
I've been uninterested, learning life is what matters
Chill, I'm the humble bragger
I could son a rapper, every one of you rappers
Vmonos, I be running you rappers
Adios, I don't see none of you rappers
All of y'all under me rappers
I need to golf, need a day to relax
Get a massage, Al Jarreau on the track
Al Jarreau of rap, made the Mets hat
More famous than Strawberry, y'all know this already

[Chorus: Nas]
Here's our symphony
A measure by measure, a pleasure of harmony, melody
Heres the memories
I used to play 40th and Vernon every yesterday

[Verse 2: Nas]
Had a lot of losses
It hurt a lot losing cats but it was worth it
I gave a lot, giving back still
I catch heat cause I'm black and Im ill
And I'm real and made millions and they in they feelings
They can't hide it
I don't internalize it, I ignore it
I was taught to observe it
Not absorb it, so I dont absorb it

[Chorus: Nas & Al Jarreau]
Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same

[Break: Nas]
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, tumbling, fumbling, fumbling
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, stumbling, tumbling, fumbling

[Verse 3: Nas]
Evolution of a man and his music
The ill fill of harmonic symphonic acoustic
My Wikipedia just said it, I'm multimedia
When you rock O2 arena
You made it then it's crazy and now you gotta rock stadiums
I played it some where you tuck away and play the cut
Then they front
Then the shade come, they try to say that your day is done

[Chorus: Nas & Al Jarreau]
Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same

[Outro: Al Jarreau]
Here's a melody, I used to play counterpoint every every yesterday
Here's a melody, I used to play counterpoint every every yesterday
Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, tumbling, fumbling, fumbling
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, tumbling, fumbling, fumbling
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same



[Lyrics missing]



[Produced by L.E.S]

[Verse 1: Quan]
Can we please have a moment of silence
That's for my niggas doing years in confinement
And for my soldiers that passed over, no longer living
That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get 'em
Can we please pour out some liquor
Symobolizing let's take in time to consider that
Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here
And we gon' rep til slugs kill us here
This for my dogs, stuck in the struggle trying to gain
Smoking trauma, sniffing Ra while selling cocaine
Trapped in the game, not knowing how to stop and get by
To live it alive, so instead they live it to die
Can we please have a moment of peace
For every G that fell for his flag in the streets
Blooding and thugging, folking and loking
Criping and creeping, Latin and Kinging
Or just for poor righteous teaching

[Hook x2: Quan]
As day comes and night falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishing y'all were home

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yeah and can we have another moment of silence
For brothers who died from Black-on-Black violence
From here to the Dark Continent where rebels sell diamonds
To clients allover the world, got little Black girls dying
And can we please pour some more liquors
For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy my niggas
Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan
It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on
Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets
And I promise through rhyming Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest
And can we please have a moment of truth
For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots
And families back home who pray they make it home safe
Hoping that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles
This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you
Mommy I'm still here, wishing I was there with you
Let's take 'em home

[Hook x2: Quan]
As day comes and night falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishing y'all were home

[Verse 3: Quan]
And can we please have a moment to mourn
For Pac, Biggie and Pun, 'cause through us they live on
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah and Aaliyah
Big L and Left Eye, when we die we hope to see ya
Can we please have a moment for children
Who got raped or murdered or trapped in the system
Who never knew their father, never learned to dream
But was guided by drug dealers, killers and crack fiends
For single mothers that's forced to play mom and dad
Busting her ass to give her kids shit she never had
For my niggas in the pen hoping rhymes'll get 'em signed
So when released, they can say bye to a life of crime
For every mother that held a son in the street bleeding
Crying a song of sorrow to dark and deep for speaking
Just a moment outside the day to day struggle
To let the ones we really care about know that we love 'em

[Hook: Quan]
As day comes and night falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishing y'all were home



[Verse 1: Quan]
Can we please have a moment of silence?
That's for my niggas doin' years in confinement
And for my soldiers who passed over, no longer living
That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get 'em
Can we please pour out some liquor?
Symobolizin', let's take in time to consider that
Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here
And we gon' rep 'til slugs kill us here
This for my dawgs stuck in the struggle tryin' to gain
Smokin' trauma, sniffin' Ra while sellin' cocaine
Trapped in the game, not knowin' how to stop and get by
To live it alive, so instead they live it to die
Can we please have a moment of peace?
For every G that fell for his flag in the streets
Bloodin' and thuggin', folkin' and lokin'
Crypin' and creepin', Latin and kingin'
Or just for poor righteous teachin'

[Hook: Quan sings]
As days goes and nights fall
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishin' y'all were home

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yeah, and can we have another moment of silence?
For brothers who died from black-on-black violence
From here to the Dark Continent were rebels sell diamonds
To clients allover the world, got little Black girls dyin'
And can we please pour some more liquors?
For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy -- my niggas
Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan
It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on
Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets
And I promise through rhymin' Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest
And can we please have a moment of truth?
For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots
And families back home who pray they make it home safe
Hopin' that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles
This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you
Mommy I'm still here, wishin' I was there with you
Let's take 'em home

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Quan]
And can we please have a moment to mourn?
For Pac, Biggie and Pun cause through us they live on
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Ty and Alliyah
Big L and Left Eye, when we die we wish to see ya...

[Nas]
Photographs of lost memories
On the blocks with blunts and Hennessey
Picture some niggas in mock neck shirts
Ballantine Ale in brown bags
Brothers like to brag 'bout their cousins
That locked in the system
We all fall victims, we all call Christian
Or Islamic faith, to restore all our faith
Barbed wire and tall brick wall
But we all can escape

[Hook]







[Verse 1: Nas]
I had a dream I was a gangster, drinkin' Moets, holdin' Tecs
Makin' sure the cash is correct, then I stepped
Investments in stock, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gun fights with the cops
Custom-made suits, hands full of ice and gold
Makin' thousand dollar bets on the dice I rolled
Girls workin' night patrol, the whore market
When I walk, niggas is rollin' out the red carpet
Now, how good could a black man have it?
Livin' like a king is a habit, I keep an automatic
The whole crew life is love above word
Rumors about the way we make niggas well heard
Nicknamed the "Killa Clan", soon to kill a man
If there's still a gram, I shake my left hand
And not do a minute on the rock
'Cause if I do a minute on the rock, the juries gettin' knocked
About girls I kept braggin'
'Cause I owned all the runner-ups in every state's beauty pageant
Inside my Lamborghini, pour you a Martini
Little kids in the streets, they wanna be me
I'm livin' in a mansion, hold a nigga's wife for ransom
I'm like a rich Charles Manson
A view, backyard, about 40 acres
You read about me in the papers
I hit the jackpot every night from all my crack spots
We attack cops for props
I got sons with guns, they all done crimes
They so wild, they even scare my ass sometimes
Other niggas on the blocks is so corny
I got my dime, I'm lookin like someone smoke for me
Bad bitches kissin' my ass
I got a few mill in the stash with beds made of cash
But on my head was a price
I made the bad-guys in Miami-Vice look nice
All of a sudden, I got raided, my crib was invaded
But, the Nas still made it ...
... To the getaway car
And now my drivin' skills gotta be up to par
The cops parked the car and sprayed till it was smoked up
That's when I woke up

[Hook: Piano hook]

[Jungle]
Yea Nas, nigga
Word Life Kid

[Verse 2: Nas]
The whole thing was a nightmare
I fell asleep watchin' Scarface, layin' in the chair
Standin' on the block, it was flooded with cops
Through the parks was the D's and the Narcs
Watchin' me walkin' out my buildin
Starin' and hawkin shit, but I as fortunate
I usually be goin' out with the 9
Instead, I had 10 bucks to buy a dime ...
... Bag of weed, never cracks, I ain't with that
I bought Buddha, some Phillies and a Kit-Kat
Now I'm walkin' back, through the drug infested area
Which was filled with hysteria
When a cop yelled, "Come here, black."
I thought to myself, "What part of the game is that?"
I didn't do no crime for you to be wastin' your time
With your antagonistic mind
He said that I was bein' smart and I better run
He looked like a Klans-man with a gun
So, I started floatin'
Police in Queensbridge, they don't be jokin'
I ran up my crib, in the nick of time
Rolled up a Philly and stashed the 9
Police later left, I was outta breath and what not
Somebody got shot, that why it's hot
I called my man and told him the adventure
And later, I meet him at the community center
I need a six pack of Beck's
It's Just Another Day in the Projects!

[Hook: Piano Hook]



[Intro]
Keep it raw for ya. No doubt PR. Check it

[Verse 1]
Play your position focus on life, see what you're missing
Reality, the tale or the caliber
.45-Nickel-9. check the calender
'97m deep algebra, black plaga
Rule the world high, ___
With my gangster for single years
And rap world emulates my life for years
Autobiography a part of me
Portaits of the ill shit inside of me
Magnetic, jigged up to my faded wig
Any position I'm in, I find a way to live
Out of state, on the block or behind metal gate
Yo, this heavyweight got cheddar to make
Smack your head off, click wildling, push through
Puerto rock warriors too you through
The drama
Escobar or Pablo, Miliano, Pabo; take the world pronto
Word to mine, genuine, Seor Juan at your table
Poision you, mad fatal
Just the way it is, when you let the hood raise you
Never let them hoes play you
Mental, smart, strong and stable



[Hook]
To the kids in the p.j.'s
Ghetto children I know it ain't easy
Ya'll wanting millions
Sunshine turns to rain
Its ghetto pain
When a one time raise
Sometimes the young is slain

To the kids in the p.j.'s black babies
Brought up in this world where it's wild and crazy child of the Nile
Future lifestyle looks hazey
Dreams to drive a Mercedes
With a pile of ladies

[NAS]
Third grade singing star spangled banner
Using proper manners
Learnt to handle anger animal behavior
Later on my block rocking with my jocks on
Eating Bon Ton cheese popcorn
Humming a KISS rock song
Socks long to my knees
Summer breeze running through the leaves playing freeze tag
Can I stay out please dad
Can I hang out with my little gang out
Hearing shots rang out
Heard my moms call my name out
Come upstairs run up stairs
Take a bath shit stained underwear
Wipe yourself with paper bad
Little ass in my bed at 8:30 wash my plate
Ate dinner up late
Gazing at the wall praying basketball
Was my future for this young one
Hooping in the sun
Proud to be where I come from
Later shooting guns fantasizing
Fascinated by gold rope chains
Looking back at my hood days
But things ain't changed

[Hook]

[Millenium Thug]

In my hood niggas smoke wood
Nothing is good
Look at my eys and see what I could
Living my life and feel what I felt
The hand that I was dealt
Drama that my uncle Shabazz had
I was a little lad
Niggas shooting through my Grams window shattering glass
Had the chicken pox
On that toy horse that rocks
My moms grabbed me down to safety
Everybody in the crib was going crazy
That was in the 80's
And now im 17
Money cash dreams
Niggas be slave
I be brave spit like A.K.'s and S.K.'s
Close range niggas see brains
Millenium Thugs the name
But now it's slash cocaine
Blast niggas in vaine
Satch yo' chain
Cherrish the life
My niggas got a fetish for ice
Turn out the lights
I bust so I could spar up the night
Uniting the pipes
Queensbridge niggas is sheist
Need no price body yall dudes on spite
Who knew I would of spazzed out
Little Nayshawn owner of the crack house
Get my papes on
Tired of 'friderators all the steaks gone

[Wiz]
Now picture this shit
With six Aunts five Uncles
Thugging a double apartment out
Kids, cousins, and brothers
There I go in the pamper by the radiator
Cursing eatin first
Little nigga with a appetite that got worst
Firs day of school ten man cliq
All I'm learning is how to extort shit
'cuz class I forefit
Graduated on another level
Selling birds busting birds
Fuck with the herbs
Never we fuck up the herbs
Make 'em pay like you
Stick 'em up get down
Since ten was taught to turn 'em around
Rip they pockets out
Bust two the way they run
I ain't give a fuck that's how I was
I was young

[Hook]

[Horse]
Horse was born as a brave child
Big for my size
A bully to little guys
With chocolate miks and apple pies
The playground was mine
I stayed scarred up all the time
From shopping carts flipping
Now we race to the finish line
Hated playing cooties 'cuz that shit
Wasn't fun all the honey's say I'm it
Then they little ass run
I was sweared to put a hickey on the ones
That I caught
I was a nasty little nigga I learned to hump before I walk
Kept a sling shot on my side to shoot
Squirrles and cats
Wanted to be Captain America with the
Shield and the hat I started getting older fell
More in love with the streets
Infactuated by the ropes and the shiny
Gold teeth I was to big to break dance
Fuck spiining on my back
My role models now run numbers and sell
Crack this project child blessed
Chasing ghetto success
He needs a name for himself
To ge the same respect



[Chorus]
Picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G
Girl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G

[Verse 1]
She was the modern Isis, honey thought she was priceless
Perfect definition what a wife is, I like this
Showed me how exciting life is
I used to hang around dudes that used ice picks
The sheistiest, put you on they heist list
How we met it must have been fate
First date, crushed grapes, we ate lobster and steak
She kept asking questions how the cash made how my rent's paid
How many guns I sprayed and huns I laid
She said she want to have a family raise kids someday
Like out in Beverly Hills she wanna live one day
I can get with that I drop you off home
I call you hit me back
I wanna dig that and did I? I did that
Put it way up where her ribs at, her future kids had
You held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats
You precious, more precious than lost treasure
Matter of fact I'm kinda hoping we can stay together

[Chorus]
Picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G
Girl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G

[Verse 2]
I see you dressed up in white face covered in veil
Do I hear wedding bells? My dogs throwing rice
And it's the day that your father give you away
To a real man that gently put the ring on your hand
Do we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to
Now, look me in my eyes and say I do
Driving off in the Rolls Royce just married on the plates
We can spend our honeymoon in the States
You can throw your friend the bouquet
Something in the back of my head say
For us two, maybe cause I love you
Hug you, squeeze you, touch you, tease you
As long as we together it's heaven for me to please you
Won't stop 'til I tell you me to, beautiful
Deeper and harder love laying new with you
Running my fingers through your hair it's like days can go by
While I'm with you and I won't even care, word

[Chorus]
Picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G
Girl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G

[Verse 3]
She been with young dudes, old guys, Hindus, pa-pi's
Colombians who cut pies, but none of them can touch Nas
Thug ones to those soft as baby shit
She been with hoodlums and those who had crazy chips
'Til one day she decided to flip
It was nutting I can do about it, like she the boss and shit
Started talking this divorcing shit
I gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake
Half my car, half my kids? Can't get that
Tried to swing on the God, had to dip that
Yo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that
All she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass
Had to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look
With a fine-ass body and a damn good cook
For some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too
You my queen, God bless you

[Chorus]
Picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G
Girl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G
Picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G
Girl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G
Picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G

[Intro]
Uhh, uhh, uhh

[Chorus]
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through (uhh)
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official

[Verse 1]
Y'all don't know about my Biggie wars
Who you thought Kick in the Door was for?
But that's my heart, y'all still trippin' off the Jigga shit
Real niggas listen up and I'ma tell you how the whole thing start
Off top I brung Queens up from hard times
Rockin' at the Fever, streets was all mine
It was my version of the blues, droppin' out schools
The crack epidemic had rap representin' new rules
So I got in them shoes, tried 'em, wore them
Wasn't a perfect fit so I couldn't sport 'em
Young murderers ride, I knew all them
Jungle got shot, Will died, we was warrin'
I wrote it in my album
I was 18 when Lake seen the Island, and Lord held me down and
My surroundings started changin', I had a baby
I was makin' my rounds with AZ
Niggas started noticin' my flow and was open when
The Golden Child closed 'em in
With more style than them older men
Puff tried to start a label, Prince Rakeem had formed Wu-Tang
Snoop and Dre had a new thing
So Puff drove his new Range through Queensbridge Projects
He let me drive it, before Ready to Die hit
Big and I hit blunts performin' at the Ark
Next thing you knew, Big blew and all the ballin' starts
He had Kim in his crew, I found Fox
Only niggas in New York with number one charts
Big was ahead of his time, him and Raekwon
My niggas, but dig it, they couldn't get along
That's when Ghostface said it on The Purple Tape
Bad Boy bitin' Nas album cover, wait
Big told me Rae was stealin' my slang
And Rae told me, out in Shaolin, Big would do the same thing
But I borrowed from both them niggas
Jigga started to flow like us, but hit with "Ain't No Niggas"
Had much Versace swagger
Big admired the Brooklynite and took him in as Iceberg the rapper
Today, don't know nothin' about this boss shit
There's more shit than wantin' to be this King of New York shit
Uhh, uhh, uhh

[Chorus]
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu (uhh)
Look at the life that I've been through (yeah)
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official

[Verse 2]
Rap became a version of Malcolm and Martin
Rest in peace Will, Queensbridge live on
There's some ghetto secrets I can't rhyme in this song
There's some missing pieces I had to leave out
Had lost trust for Steve Stoute at some point 'til I got to know him
We old friends, but what's loyal?
Puff soaked Interscope offices with champagne bottles on Steve
And Steve thought the drama's on me
'Cause previously it would've been, against whoever
Friends forever
However, I learned, with some niggas it's all business
But I'm a street dude with morals
Then this nigga's with Jigga too much
He used to say Jay wanted my spot
I laughed, stayed home, never hung a lot
A quiet man who used to be alone plannin'
Baby moms thought I was too quiet, couldn't stand it
She hit the streets, later on she hittin' the sheets
With a rapper who wanted me on his songs, thinkin' he strong
I taught her how to watch for cars who might follow
Taught her street shit that I know
Her weakness was shine yo
But that's her, I ain't mad, baby, it made me stronger
Now I get my paper longer
Illmatic I was boss, It Was Written I flossed
One of the most creative LP's ever to hit stores
In The Firm I learned I Am NAStradamus
QB's Finest, Oochie Wally, faced more problems
I gave it all up so I can chill at home with Mama
She was gettin' old and sick so I stayed beside her
We had the best times, she asked would I make more songs
I told her not 'til I see her health get more strong
In the middle of that, Jay tried to sneak attack
Assassinate my character, degrade my hood
'Cause in order for him to be the Don, Nas had to go
The Gam-B-I-N-O rules I understood
What y'all want, see, I already had
The Gift and The Curse? Fuck that shit, the first you'll be last
I'm the man's man, a rapper's rapper
G-O-D, S-O-N  they'll be none after
I was Scarface, Jay was Manolo
It hurt me when I had to kill him and his whole squad for dolo...
Uhh, uhh, uhh

[Chorus]
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official

[Chorus: Nas & Nashawn]
These are last words of a hanging slave
How could I forget this
I rob you, put you on my hit list
Under my nails are dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine
Being broke and bag a dope bitch
Powerful minds, we brave men
I blow smoke and I'ma keep sayin'
These are last words of a hanging slave
How could I forget this
I rob you, put you on my hit list
Under my nails are dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine
Being broke and bag a dope bitch
Powerful minds, we brave men
I blow smoke and I'ma keep sayin'

[Verse 1: Nashawn]
I wanna be more than that bullet that go through ya zone
Wanna be the lead that tear through ya skin and crack bones
Wanna be the heat you feel makin' ya moan
Wanna be the hospital bed that you lay on
Wanna be the god you feel when you pray-on
It's Nashawn the type that get the hyper calm
I'm gonna kill somethin', rap cats be real frontin'
Fuck shootin' legs, cock back put his brains on the pave
Nigga how 'bout that, close range with the gauge get payed
First rapper to shoot off stage
Turn the front page the next day, my life is like a book
A twenty four hour song without no hook
Millennium Thug computer chips up in my slug
Turn corners when you turn corners, know who to plug
Thugs around me outside its grimy outside
Better slide before you get bodied outside

[Chorus: Nas & Nashawn]
These are last words of a hanging slave
How could I forget this
I rob you, put you on my hit list
Under my nails are dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine
Being broke and bag a dope bitch
Powerful minds, we brave men
I blow smoke and I'ma keep sayin'
These are last words of a hanging slave
How could I forget this
I rob you, put you on my hit list
Under my nails are dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine
Being broke and bag a dope bitch
Powerful minds, we brave men
I blow smoke and I'ma keep sayin'

[Verse 2: Nas]
I'ma prison cell six by nine
Livin' hell stone wall metal bars for the gods in jail
My nickname the can, the slammer, the big house
I'm the place many fear 'cause there's no way out
I take the sun away put misery instead
When you with me most folks consider you dead
I saw too many inmates fallin' apart
Call for the guards to let them out at night when it's dark
Convicts think they alone but if they listen close
They can hear me groan touch the wall feel my pulse
All the pictures you put up is stuck to my skin
I hear ya prayers (even when ya whisperin')
I make it hotter in the summer, colder in the winter
If the court parole ya then another con enters
No remorse for your tears I seen 'em too often
When you cry I make you feel alive inside a coffin
Watch you when you eat play with you mind when you sleep
Make you dream that you free then make you wake up to me
Face to face with a cage no matter your age
I can shatter you turn you into a savage in rage
Change ya life that's if you get a chance to get out
'Cause only you and I know what sufferings about
Yo it's stunnin' when bed sheets become your woman
And I'm the one that gotcha weapons when the beef is comin'
Maybe one day I'll open up my arms to release you
You'll always be my property nigga stay legal...

[Chorus: Nas & Nashawn]
These are last words of a hanging slave
How could I forget this
I rob you, put you on my hit list
Under my nails are dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips

Powerful minds, we brave men
I blow smoke and I'ma keep sayin'
These are last words of a hanging slave
How could I forget this
I rob you, put you on my hit list
Under my nails are dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine

"Ladies and gentleman
In this corner
The champion of champions
From Catskill, New York
Iron Mike Tyson"

And in the other corner
The lyrical champion
Hailing from Queensbridge, New York
Is the one and only
Nas

And now, ladies and gentlemen and boxing fans joining us around the world.  IT'S SHOWTIME!

Verse 1:
Spirit of the streets
Walks in the ring
From Brownsville to spar fit
To boxing king
Man or machine, an animal
Physical strength and intelligence
But that type of intellect
Y'all respect
To connect those punches
Still as a kid he stole lunches
To mak'in millions and the hundreds
Chaotic conscience
The rage, the stage, the grander
Had to endorse slander
Took it like a man
Cause the mighty stand alone
In the bigger ring hole
The penitentiary
Barbed wire and stone was amp up
They locked a champ up
Even my brains in handcuff
The robin hood, seasonal santa
And y'all give him nothin to begin with
Dilapidated buildings
The drug epidemics
Historical stories
Pain, love and glory
Mike Tyson
Never see another like him

? voice over: Speed
Nas: strength
? : skill
Nas: Power
? : Accuracy
Nas: Legacy
? : Victorious
Nas: Legendary

Verse 2:
True legend
His hands was two weapons
Understand this minds a true blessing
Designer jewels and diamond
A modern day Jack Johnson
Flying private jets and fully protect'in
Automized with ladies Godiva complexions
Lots of sex'in
Hung with a lot of stars
Learned a lot of lessons
Between dead homies and best friends
And getting domed out in stretch Benz
Educated from the hood and pestilence
The dead presidents don't see your pockets
You just gett'in
You got a full court press for them
Benjamins, I've seen money be the death of men

It's a warriors world
Only the strong survive
Who's next to try
Who's next to be the next
T-Y-S-O-N
He gave us hope
May the best man win

Outro chorus:
Iron Mike is in the house
Nas: Strength
Iron Mike is in the house
Nas: Power
Iron Mike is in the house
Nas: Legacy
Iron Mike is in the house
Nas: Legendary
(repeat)

DJ Green Lantern:
This is an invasion man
Best of both offices, what's good
Team Invasion, let's go man, let's get money!



[Cee-Lo (Nas)]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la..
(Uh-oh, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Mr. International, the man centerfold, women loathe
Voice bump out the Bose in a tinted Rolls
Craftiness, take a stab at it
Don't ask if Nasty's back at it
I don't run out of magic
Popular, box-cutter flow
Time is money; the watch cost dough
Shakin' the dice, fragrances from some beautiful ladies
The lights, the ambiance, yeah, this is the life
The money, hotties on each arm - It's on
I party like a rap star, baby, the facts are
The third time's a charm
So, meet me by the Eiffel Tower
Bring a bottle of Dom

[Cee-Lo]
I am here (I am here)
This is the place (This is the place)
The atmosphere of espionage at expensive taste
And each one that I see is an unfamiliar face
So, I guess I'll just cut straight to the chase
And before I could say the name of who've I came to see
Someone suspicion then came to me
I'm so close and I've come so far
A glass of red wine sent from the woman at the end of the bar
I love to talk to you; but I don't have the time
She looks like the prettiest part of a perfect crime
Ohh, if I could I could I'd put a picket fence around a wild flower
But darling I have Less Than an Hour
(I.... have Less Than an Hour)
(I.... have Less Than an Hour)
Hmmmm... Ohhhh... funny how time flies when you're having fun
(Nas: Yeah, let' em know) But I got to do what must be done

[Verse 2]
You're on a winnin' streak
You've survived the killer streets
Now you at the crap table, where the real villains meet
Number seven might get you to Heaven
You break the bank, just might make you a legend
It's after eleven, you playin' against a poker face
Genie eyes, light green, sippin' on Bellini's
You play your cards right, she'll let you touch
She'll be a devil in disguise; lady incubus
Better know who to trust
She might roll with thugs who roll bodies up in Asian rugs
I'mma rush up and move on 'em, put the uz' on 'em
The crews do somethin' new, inform me

[Cee-Lo]
(I.... have Less Than an Hour)
Ohhh... time will wait baby
(I.... have Less Than an Hour)
Ew-ohhh.... ewwwwwwwww.... hmmmmm..
I'm in the pursuit of my own personal power
And I only have an hour



[Intro]
Yeah, check check, testing
It's clear out there, yeah
It's like I'm hang glidin' over the hood, ha
Never worry (ohhh, no, no, no)

[Verse 1]
Check, let there be light
No gang bangin' in New York tonight
Just murals of Biggie Smalls, bigger than life
Turn up the kid mic cause ya'll ain't listenin' right
What's all this talk that Nas got bought?
I'd rather outline my body in white chalk
Ain't nobody been where I been, they at a stand still
This is all overseen by my man Will

[Hook: Tre Williams]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I know that I ain't got much time left
And they don't really wanna see the good in me
Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me
And I know my business, so my sins great
And I thank the hood for all the love they gave
And I forgive 'em all, they did they best to hate
Oh, let there be light!

[Verse 2]
This ain't to glorify, just painting a street picture
There's no guidance or Bibles, just blunts and swishers
Gillettes cut 'caine in kitchen
Now every rapper wanna claim he hang with Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff, and
It's like the same difference except when niggas get arraigned
They don't want the same sentence, niggas get to snitchin
If I could reverse demises and turn falls to rises
And bring back the niggas who was livest
Old hustlers, reminiscing on better days
They home, doing nothing, might as well be in a cage
Hating on young brothers, one foot in the grave
They used to love us
Till we found our own way through the maze
New York, set trippin' and flaggin'
Got the West Coast laughin'
Now Esco's askin', "What happened?"
My homegirl from upper Manhattan; she remembers the quarters that's Latin, a lot of rat-a-tat-tattin'

[Hook: Tre Williams]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I know that I ain't got much time left
And they don't really wanna see the good in me
Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me
And I know my business, so my sins great
And I thank the hood for all the love they gave
And I forgive 'em all, they did they best to hate
Oh, let there be light!

[Verse 3]
The son of the audio cassette era, TEC wearer
Bullets and baguettes, Benz Bose Speaker Terror
Deman I get mine till I'm dead, so I can drive somethin' red
Like that horse standing on it's hind legs
Since Arnold and Willis in they bunk beds
I wanted bread like Wonder
Not Ned the Wino like the parents of Lionel
Nas is the Ghetto American Idol
No matter what you do you're never getting my title
I can't sound smart, cause y'all will run away
They say I ain't hungry no more and I don't talk about Ye
Like there's no other way for a ex-hustler
Cake getter, the ex-wig splitter to touch you, I beg to differ
When you're four years into the game
We can have a conversation
Eight years in the game, I invite you on vacation
Ten years in the game, after I've enjoyed my fame
Only then I let you pick my brain, niggas

[Bridge: Nas + (Tre Williams)]
[And I] Right about now [And I] (They don't really know)
[And I] (They don't really see)
I don't even deal with all that garbage
(No, no, no) We getting real right, you know?
[And I] (Though I walk through the valley)
That is Tre Williams, ladies and gentlemen
[And I] (They should fear no) [And I] (no, no-oh)
Focus on good things, man, good times, heh-heh, alright

[Hook: Tre Williams]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I know that I ain't got much time left
And they don't really wanna see the good in me
Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me
And I know my business, so my sins great
And I thank the hood for all the love they gave
And I forgive 'em all, they did they best to hate
Oh, let there be light!
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I know that I ain't got much time left
And they don't really wanna see the good in me
Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me
And I know my business, so my sins great
And I thank the hood for all the love they gave
And I forgive 'em all, they did they best to hate
Oh, let there be light!

Oh let it be, let it be, yeah
Let it be, let it be














[Intro]
Yo, yeah
It's that Queens shit, the real shit
Illmatic
It's the N-A-S, yes
Yo

[Chorus]
I wake up every morning
Thinking what we gonna do today (what we gonna do today)
There's got to be a better way (got to be a better way)
To maintain is the price of fame, life is like a dice game
Maintain is the price of fame, life is like a dice game

[Verse]
1, 2... I never knock a brother, I'm anti-jail for real
Smooth criminal skill, locked in a human flesh shield
Watching niggas get rich beside me
Pushing a 5 B-Y me up in the passenger seat
But I see me as Hallie Selassie in my kingdom
Sipping Asti Spumante, dripped in, reality kicks in
I need the papes to start clicking
Got a connect out in Richmond, ain't nigga in the fam will pitch in
It's on, word is bond, that's my name, big Nas, all wise to civilize
From the Northern Hemisphere of the earth
Peace to my seed and thanks for her birth
Destiny, that's her name
It's going on, you know my name
Big Nas in the house, y'all, on the freestyle tip
When I finish this shit, it's sure to be a hit
Peace, peace



[Intro: Nas]
Yo, Ill Will, Ruff Ryders
What what, straight like that

[Verse 1: Nas]
You a killer or a hustler, dealer or customer
Gangsta or buster, youngster or old nigga
A weed head, a coke sniffer
You rich or a broke nigga
Know you all relate to this shit that I wrote niggas
Lots of my mans trapped up in a max
Penitentiary, sending me letters I answer back
That eventually, we all be Bentley'ed out
Throwing campaigns, fuck it I'm running for White House
My niggas control Senate, pipe seats, Jeeps tinted
Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit
Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day
So I'm on point, strapped, prepare for gunplay
Stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar
Ready to blast, nigga gave me daps said I feel ya
Can't believe how my life changed
From the hood, the first time in my life
I can say I did the right thing

[Chorus: Nas (DMX)]
Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh)
Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh-huh)
Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh)
Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh-huh)

[Verse 2: DMX]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Everyday shit, around the way shit got me stressed (what)
So I keep on the vest in case a nigga wanna test (uh)
I got no time for games 'cause I'm all grown up
You wanna joke nigga? Laugh when you get blown up (come on)
See how funny it is when your kids ain't got no father
Cause you played it sweet now you floating in the harbor (for real)
Shit is hectic so respect it for your health (what)
Didn't think it was right, you should've checked it yourself (come on)
Life is too short to get caught up in some dumb shit
Wake up one day, 40 years old on some bum shit
Time flew by, you was too fly to see the light
Everyday it's getting darker then comes the night
Now what? (what) Realize that you ain't got shit (uh)
Not long ago you was the man on some hot shit
So just peep the flow yo, 'cause you already in this
Make sure your shit is right kid and handle your business (uh huh)

[Chorus: Nas (DMX)]
Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh)
Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh-huh)
Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh)
Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh-huh)

[Verse 3: Nas]
Make history before you go
Fuck the misery, you living po' we gettin dough
Except the dollars other reasons why I'm living yo (why?)
Time is valuable
Low and behold the young, black, and powerful
Got to eat yo, everyday my daughter feet grow
You wack and cheap with the doe, my heat could blow
Paying doctors when I'm born, a preacher if I'm buried
That's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit
Gotta pay just for living, tax life is a bid'ness
If you catch a bad deal, watch your life diminish
Deals made by God and the Devil, and we in it
Pawns in the game, can't complain or say shit
Just strap up and hold on, hope for the best
Prepare for the worst, no fears no nothing on earth
No tears if I'm dumped in a hearse, I won't be the first
Nor the last, nigga, let's get this cash, nigga

[Chorus: Nas (DMX)]
Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh)
Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh-huh)
Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh)
Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh-huh)

[Intro: AZ and Nas]
Ayo, what's up, what's up?
Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, yeah
Ayo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
I'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?
Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, then what, man, what?!

[Verse 1: AZ]
Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us, cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
Cause life's a bitch and then you die

[Chorus: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye

[Verse 2: Nas]
I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', "Fuck tomorrow!"
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage

[Chorus: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die

I didn't come from a privileged family

We just rise, right?
With no help, we can risw in the wave
For me, I needed more than money though
I wanted to be heard man

[Intro]
To my niggas.. huh..
We all we got..
Let's hold it down though, y'know?
However it's gon' go down
This what we gotta deal with, y'know?
Yo..

[Chorus]
It's the life we chose (uhh), where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know (uhh)
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it
And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..
(But yo..) this life is the only life I know...

[Verse 1]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
Gold bathtubs, making love to my Queen
Get my back rubbed, Chardonnay, rolling up green
Statues, marble floors, rare paintings on my wall
My lifestyle's like the Forbes Magazine
Closets, full of rockets and sub-machines
Take this nigga out the projects, and his thug team
Yo we cruise past street lights, ill rides
Mr. Chow both coasts with the most loud toast
Calicos roast y'all folks, keep y'all dying
'Cause it's hard to fuck around when we dealing with science
My enemies got money, so y'all should watch how I play it
They never know we enemies until they hear me say it
Til they kid's on the phone saying, "Please daddy pay it"
Til they brain's on the floor, mixed on the pavement
High-class elegance, you respect or you hiss
You go against you'd rather piss on an electrical fence
It's strategic, how these niggas want you to think
You'd be surprised, who'd be the one to put you to sleep
Why you stink? Yo these streets don't allow you to blink
You get showered by lead, coming out with your mink
Bow ties and tuxedos, bust Eagles
Dump drugs and acid, then they rush with the Rico
It's hard fucking with niggas you hope you can trust
You a fool if your main bitch is easy to fuck
And you've got money - is these hoes greedy or what?
Shit is devious, ex-friends wanting you stuck

[Chorus]
It's the life we chose, where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it
And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..
This life is the only life I know...

[Verse 2]
Uhh, what's love when you don't give your man enough dough?
He wanna stick you
What's love, you got beef?
Nobody rolling with you
What's love, you locked up, and your family don't care
Is love a four-letter word, that deceives the ear?
What's real, when you know your man's girl is a ho
And you don't even let him know, 'cause you fucked her befo'
What's real, when you talk behind a man's back
Then you see him and give him dap, now explain that?
What's trust, when they separate your case
When you at your court date, your co-de', can't look in your face
What's trust, when you keep your wife away from your man?
And he never crossed you, but you claiming he's fam'?
What's trust, when you get bust, your niggas don't retaliate?
They blaze purple haze with 'em the next day?
God forbid one of my niggas get hit, I'ma go haywire
Won't hesitate, I'ma spray fire
But everybody's different, you won't know how you react
Til you in that position, and that's an actual fact
The hearts of men change as time goes on, who's wrong?
You was hungry when you stuck Duke, he came back to buck you
Who's wrong? Foul all your life, now you 90
On your deathbed you regret being grimy
What's lust, a bust nut? What's a thug?
A ghetto child raised around drugs 'til he's old enough to bust slugs?
Then what's jail, to rehabilitate, or to make a nigga worse
When he come home to catch another case?
Life's about decisions, you choose it, you gotta live it
You did it, heaven or hell or prison
Who knows when your clock'll stop ticking, get your weight up
Save up before it's over neighbor, I told ya
You getting older player, look at those who gave up

[Chorus]
It's the life we chose, where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it
And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..
This life is the only life I know...



[Intro: Anthony Wilson]
Ay yeah, what's happening mommy? How you doing baby?
Oh you looking kinda good and everything, I see you with them stilettos on baby
Ay check this out, you ain't got time to talk to me?
Ay let me put the bug in your ear baby
Why don't you turning them floor shoes into some ho shoes, ya dig?
Yeah, check this out, this Universe Finest, your Royal Highness
You know what baby? I can do a whole lot of thangs for you
Guess why, 'cause I'm a motherfucking pimp

[Chorus: Dwayne Collins (Nas)]
(Like me...) Hustling and grinding babe
(I be...) Staying on that paper chase
I-In this life there's pimps and hoes
Tell me which one are you, you a nigga
(Like me...) Hustling and grinding babe
(I be...) Staying on that paper chase
In this life there's pimps and hoes
Tell me which one are you, you

[Verse 1: Nas]
The good man in me say, "Get money and stay on the path"
But the pimp shit in me say, "Yo, keep looking for ass"
But my daughter gave me a gift, something to hold
A little city in water, when you shake it, it snow
I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes
Better wait 'til you grown, when he love you, you'll know
Everybody's got a dream, a hopeful wish to own a six times two
Cylinder whip, a fantasy, a bone to pick
Revenge to get, against - who I don't know
Someone who said you won't blow, you won't eat, you won't cake
They mistake blaming me for they failures, I'm fresh, getting tailored
Single breasted, a lint brush is senseless, some pimp shit
A woman hates a man and stays with him for many years
Tell him she loves him and be jealous of him
Now lame is how the ghetto judge him, 'cause he still with her
She'll take his cash and give it to some other real nigga...

[Chorus: Dwayne Collins (Nas)]
(Like me...) Hustling and grinding babe
(I be...) Staying on that paper chase
I-In this life there's pimps and hoes
Tell me which one are you, you a nigga
(Like me...) Hustling and grinding babe
(I be...) Staying on that paper chase
In this life there's pimps and hoes
Tell me which one are you, you

[Interlude: Anthony Wilson]
Ay pimping been going on man for eons and eons man since the beginning of time
You know me, the only thing I need to do is get on the grind, and get mine
So the only thing I gotta tell you man is you know
Do what you gotta do man
Bring my money back, get on that track and get on your back

[Verse 2: Nas]
I heard 'em say the NBA's a bunch of million-dollar slaves
A portea wasn't real back in the days, the point I make is
Jerry owns the Lakers, his yearly takings
Let's just say more than collectively all of his players
That's business, not really pimp shit
Maybe a tid-bit similar to when we rappers make big hits
And not own the masters, that's the deal
By the way, Poitier helps all the Denzels excel
He kept it more than real, but Hollywood can turn a girl out
I knew a girl 'bout, 5'9", so fine, she could for sure grind
She was sleek, chic, with a classic mouth
Movie directors always fucked her on the casting couch
She came out with a blockbuster, can't knock a hustler
She not a hooker, she focused, a hopeless soul on a lonely road
I showed her all my stones and gold
I said "Bitch, life is cold, you need to roll with a nigga"

[Chorus: Dwayne Collins (Nas)]
(Like me...) Hustling and grinding babe
(I be...) Staying on that paper chase
I-In this life there's pimps and hoes
Tell me which one are you, you a nigga
(Like me...) Hustling and grinding babe
(I be...) Staying on that paper chase
In this life there's pimps and hoes
Tell me which one are you, you



[Intro:]
Uhh, Uhh, Where am I going?
Where am I? Yo, it's ill

[Verse 1]
Yo my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily I find 'em just at the right time
Mac in my right arm, Tequila bottle in
My left arm like Cristian
Watching my life go, Cant do myself in
Wolves in the night yo, hells men
Two revolvers I can let twelve spin
Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit
Buck-sixty, who wit' me? My (?) to well
Twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I ain't shit
No matter how much cash I sit with
Still gotta ask the lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane
So I drive the cooler pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin', I ain't saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas, drunk almost crashed
I'm going too fast, highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview, if they stop me I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo nigga watch me

[Hook]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

[Verse 2]
Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell them niggas nothing though, bullets wak'em up well
Take them to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I ain't your mark homey
It's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways, put out the haze blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in televison
Hella women, jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas expect kilos
For what they not seeing is police expect Rico
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up blastin A.C. going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The reason that I want to be alone
Tired of all the things that went wrong
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swigg
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, runors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all, things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good, find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib, trying to see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib
I'm tired...

[Hook]

[Intro: Prodigy & (Havoc)]
Fresh out the  motherfuckin' pack (Right out the pack son)
For niggas don't know how to act (No doubt son)
Fresh out the  motherfuckin' pack (No doubt son)
For niggas don't know how to act

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Yo, NYC, U-N-I-verse, seriously
Havoc and P, Queens niggas so it seem to be
Monopolize, strategies of war, exercise
Mega got word back from Noreaga
The D.A. got video cassette tape of
The god with the God-U-Now, pullin' a caper
Runnin' up in the spot, mask and duct taped up
Pig-tied they motherfuckin' wrists to they ankles
I been through, crime shit my niggas into
Peep the issue, situation like this, we stickin him too
JFK on our way to L.A
Got links with big cats down in Santa Barbr
My crew do it the Mobb way, every day
Crime pay, who wanna gunplay? Thrill me
Niggas kill me, grillin' me, you wanna look? Peep the nine milli
Now undress, you know the drill-y
Niggas suspect, weak links pose threats
I have yet to met challenger who go against my set
Gemstars razor sharp like Gillette, shavin' closely on
Any character approach me
I let the streets get the best of me, infamy, my destiny
While cat burg-lars tryin' to sneak peep the recipe
Inside my rap cookbook, paragraphs is gourmet
You pay about $5,000 a plate

[Verse 2: Havoc (Prodigy)]
No doubt kid, I hit them niggas like a bid
The prosecutor, runnin' up in your crib
Do your dirt, I do my dirt all by my lonely
It's only me, and the gat that's holdin' me
We got it locked beyond measure, your clique's under pressure
Extort you for your treasure, smack you with the undresser
Represent your clique, go ahead, get that ass whipped
(Floatin' in the river with your body wrapped in plastic)
Wannabe thug, get smacked for back talkin'
QB represent fuck that, it can happen
While you rappin', I'm busy tryin' to sneak the gat in
Contamin', cut the party short while you jammin'
We think smarter, reach harder
Got the .44, bodyguard of somethin' you don't want a part of
If I was you, then I would do what I have to
But you ain't me, you hesitated so I clapped you
Then stepped off casually, naturally me

[Verse 3: Nas]
Niggas thinkin' shit sweet, I carry big heat
Wavy hair, chipped teeth, up in this bitch deep
Queens murder cliques meet, yellow tapes on black gates
Mediterranean, projects is like Kuwait
I escape into zones, that's irregular
Why debate on the phone, I'm solar cellular
Escobar 600
You just a crumb inside a world where the rich run it
Curriculum of a mathologist
Deep throats, they try to swallow this
Anthropologists, dynasties of great knowledgists
I preserve in my dome, niggas mics is full of silicone
Spot's blown, guerilla ice on this killer's life
I put my word on it
Now you can sleep on or rock or swerve on it
Nas is menage a trois' on Mount Airy lodges
We like a smooth fam', but rougher than El DeBarge's
Catchin' charges, of marksmen, livin' heartless
Grab a cartridge, cock my shit on some Mobb shit
We mobbin', puttin' niggas in mausoleums
From Queens cross the Throgs Neck, heads bop, I see 'em

[Outro: Prodigy & (Havoc)]
For niggas don't know how to act
To all my niggas on the block slangin' crack
Rest in peace to my niggas layin' on they back
To all the niggas who bust gat
(Live nigga rap)
For niggas don't know how to act
To all my niggas on the block slangin' crack
Rest in peace to my niggas on they back
To all the niggas who bust gat
(Live nigga rap)
For niggas don't know how to act
To all the niggas on the block slangin' crack
Rest in peace to my niggas on they back
To all the niggas who bust gat
(If you's a live nigga)



[Hook]
Live now niggas, there's no promise of a second time around, put it down
We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you
All you gotta do is just, live now, we spending
Not under the ground yet, we enjoying every second yo
Live now, don't forget to bro, yeah
Cause I promise you you'll regret it bro

[Nas]
Picture my last days will be so grim
My daughter at my bedside, respirator in me
Eyes dilated, looking skinny, trying to smile, trying to say something
Whole room will quiet down just to hear my last words
Tears fall down my facial, why fear anything, it's now too late to
I'm dreaming of a time I was silked out at the peak of my career
But I always choked out, leaving mad money on the table at crazy amounts
I would hit the scene for a second and bounce
Admit I did live a little bit, sweet pickle dick
Freaks licked on it, lips I dripped on it
Sex, I shot pearl necklaces on necks and tits
Traveled half the world, wish I traveled the rest of it
From QB to Mecca kid, so if you knew me
You'd be proud to say I left you with enough memories to resurrect me with
So live now nigga

[Hook]

[Scarlett]
It's been a long time since you came through to see ya sis
You know I love you, I've been a fan since Genesis
God, I respect you cause you never tied to smash
Since we met a while back, and your style was mack
Now I see that you a man after all you been through
A stand-up dude, held me down after Sekou
Need more brothers like you in the hood, would have wifed you if I could
But the white cells in my blood were no good
Said I had it ten years, but I was just a carrier
I thought, "Me a victim?", could never be my character
It's ill Se' passed the way he did, didn't know how to tell him
Just happy it didn't get in our kid
But all the things I did was the flyest, experiences were priceless
Remember days of diamond cuts
Nugget rings, clubs in Queens, Jetta cars
Used to love them things, Barbados, Belize
I stayed over seas, shopping sprees, credit cards
Pockets of Gs, left the hood, phattest cribs
To platinum from silver, came back, bitches calling me the black Liz Taylor
Imagine that, Rob me? My nigga would kill ya, they knew the rules
All the planes I flew, niggas I ran through
Lot of unprotected sex, don't know where it came from
Grimy niggas, rich niggas, damn it ain't a game son
From the Cayman Islands to the Virgin Islands
Gucci suitcases (coughs), a chic did it, eff the screw faces
Critics and fans, they need to get a life
You doin' the right thing, settle down, get a wife now
I grew with you so you know you make me proud
And most of all you gotta live now

[Hook: Scarlett]
Live now nigga ain't no promise of a second time around, put it down, would you
We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you
All you gotta do is just, live now, keep spending
Not under the ground yet, keep enjoying every minute yo
Gotta live it up to the limit yo
Cause I promise you you'll regret it bro

[Scarlett]
Son, come close, lemme talk to you
I got music, put it out to the world, let 'em hear it
Look out for little me, one

[Intro: Kaye Fox & Hannah Sidibe]
Oooooh-ooooh-oooooooh
42nd Street Terminal

[Sounds of a subway train]

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yo, yo, I live it and I speak it, my religion is reefer
Big money and the most uninhibited freak to sleep with
My visions are realistic, nothing is figurative
I can wish it into existing, God want this nigga to live
Blunt big as a dread, I get high and forget who bled
Who we stomp-kicked in the head and who we left for dead
Who are you niggas? Why argue niggas?
The truth is the truth, I really put my scars on niggas
They wear them lifetime, they tell they hoes, Nas did this
Pointing to they scars like, right here, baby, really Nas did this
Like a badge of honor, not bragging I'm just honest
War stories we tell them, nothing's realer than karma
Sip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey
Rap Jack Dempsey, matte black Bentley, pimply
Shattering your silence, passing round the chalice
Due to my Indian ancestry at the weed dispensery
Official kings and gents is who I mix and mingle with
Fuck your ice, I rock rubies, amethyst
I'll fuck your wife 'cause she a groupie, scandalous
This for my bad hood bitches, ghetto glamorous

[Break: Large Professor]
Yo, what we talking 'bout niggas?
What we talking 'bout niggas?
This is Nas, what, Nas
What, Nasty, what, recollect motherfucker

[Verse 2: Nas]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
At seventeen I made seventeen thousand living in public housing
Integrity intact, repping hard
They asking how he disappear and reappear back on top
Saying Nas must have naked pictures of God or something
To keep winning is my way like Francis
As long as I'm breathing, I'll take chances
A soldier coming home, twenty years old with no legs
Sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go 'head
So much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start
So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
I know you think my life is good 'cause my diamond piece
But my life been good since I started finding peace
I shouldn't even be smiling, I should be angry and depressed
I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess
I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back
Like Trump being up down up, play with cash, huh

[Break: Large Professor]
My nigga's like a locomotive
Nas, we pushed it, mush it
Queensbridge to Bushwick
Harlem, Bronx, all that
You ain't even supposed to be here
You know where you at?

[Verse 3: Nas]
At night, New York, eat a slice too hot
Use my tongue to tear the skin hanging from the roof of my mouth
Shit was felicissimo melting pot, city sweltering hot
Staggering, drunker than those cops that 2Pac shot
I was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed reaching
Soon as I heard them iron wheels screeching
When it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught
Token man safe behind a locked door for sure
Minor thief shit, minor league shit, beasting
Looking for the juks young, but now we older chiefing
In my truck, play The Greatest Adventures of Slick Rick
Bugging on how his imagination was so sick
It's ghetto beef, sinister niggas snicker through yellow teeth
Alcohol aging my niggas faster than felonies
How dare I, must be, something in the air that corrupts me
Look at my upkeep, owned and sublease
I'm here y'all

[Outro: Nas]
This for my trapped in the 90s niggas
For my trapped in the 90s niggas
Ha for y'all niggas



[Intro: Angela Bofill & Nas]
In our younger days we were so in love
And the thought of losing you was enough
Can't lose me

[Verse 1: Nas]
Who be the holy prophet, they watchin with all his posture?
His Rothstein goggle game be the dopest, he gots to
Be from the '80s era
His tint is shade Carrera, Queens forever
Green pipe seats, clean Panamera
Amateur Hanna-Barbera characters know they envy
The illest Hennessy Black sipper with loaded semis
You pick of the week, voted-in rappers you go against me
You can't tantalize a call girl with just a roll of pennies
Cant bait a lion in ya trap without a tranquilizer
You enterin' a boxing ring with no trainer beside ya
My Panerai watch glows like Avatar
Caviar black diamonds, can you imagine, y'all
Takin' from a rich man plate? Kick in his door
'Cause his war with the bloodsuckers of the poor
The first shall be last, that's just universal law
Pop the cork, the Perrier-Jout pours, like this

[Verse 2: Nas]
Uh
I tell a story of a prince life and all his glory
It's killin' me softly
Somber like the buildings in Fort Greene
Hood monsters and niggas who walk mean
Hood niggas and they just came home and they grip they chrome
Can you hear me, is this thing on?
Test, one, two, gimme some feedback if yall could feel it
For the home invasion dudes that be robbin dealers
Picture me runnin' inside they crib, rollin wit' ya
Mask on the face, tyin' up the sister
Lookin' for the bricks to get richer
Smackin up the dude with the gun, take the jewels and the funds
A dirty game when you servin' 'caine
Got feds to watch, hoes to watch, checkpoints and roadblocks
Police barricades, batterrams
Doors off the hinges, wake up flinchin', who ratted, man?
Knew who it had to been, states, feds and housin' added in
Every department searchin' your apartment
Ransackin' it, found four ratchets
DEA jackets, we gotta escape the madness
Haha, yeah, escape the madness
Yeah, through the eyes of Pablo
That's how I'm lookin' at you, there's an obstacle in everything
It's all natural, I'm keepin' it pilin'
Keepin' heat with the silencers
Learnin' Greek and Italian, speak with kings while dinin'
Good with hyenas, meanin' it's hood when it's time for ridin'
Ties with suppliers from my days of the projects
Where I resided, a phenomenon
With the ambitions of a rider
Pretty amazon on my arm, nigga, I'm the flyest
The flyest, haha, yeah

[Outro]
Lemme hear that



[Intro]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted
A baby's bein' born same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end, as far as rap goes
It's only natural, I explain my plateau
And also what defines my name

[Hook: J. Cole (Sampled)]
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin

[Verse: Nas]
I ain't mad at you, young king, this unsung song is hauntin'
Along comes a one son called a offspring
The Earth spins, my Old Earth grin, sung a church hymn
She birthed in September, took my first wind, again, the Earth spins
I jumped in my first Benz, fled out, lead out
Screams got in the game and took bread out
The nerve of these niggas, weak flow, yo Cole let's murder this sequel
Freedom or jail from Fayetteville to QB though
'Cause back when I was young there was massive niggas
But I passed them niggas, just bein' nasty, nigga
Military hat, fatigue pants saggin', Henny'd up
Execs askin' will he live to see his own release date happen
Straight off the corner with the armor, Arm and Hammer
But I had a appeal, I was a charmer
Yet still bein' my mama's son was my biggest honor
This shit was just kinda just a hobby in my project lobby
We was tryna be the Queensbridge Cosby's
But the street life robbed me of that, so I had to put it in raps
And who could I ask for help? Older niggas was gettin' mad
But that's the gift and the curse, that's the good and the bad
At least you got Jay, but he already one of the greats
And it's hard for the great to tell somebody how to be great
Nigga I tried and niggas threw that shit right back in my face
They took my cosign, but they ain't let me EP their tapes
And when they joint tanked, that's when they point blame
So point blank, young Cole, you won't be the same
The first album freedoms and them fourth album pressures
A big difference between 'em but I get why you said it
Radio records are needed, I just wanted it to bring the warnin'
Global warmin' to that cold world you was breathin'
That's some advice I never got
If I don't sell another record, I'll just steady rock
While you was writin' down my rhymes I was just tryna show you
That if you say what's on ya mind, you can stand the test of time
Now I'm playin' Born Sinner loud, saw you live, rock the crowd
Like wow, you made your nigga Nas proud

[Bridge: Nas]
So you ain't let Nas down
It's just part of the game, becoming a rap king, my nigga
You ain't let Nas down
How that sound? Here the crown, pass it to you like nothin', nigga
You ain't let Nas down

[Outro: Nas]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Slick Rick was like Jesus, G Rap wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
Large Professor's my mentor, that's how the story end

[Intro]
Bravehearts, Bravehearts, Bravehearts

[Verse 1]
Now let's get it all in perspective
For all y'all enjoyment, a song y'all can step with
Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't Five-O, y'all know it's Nas, yo
Grey Goose and a whole lot of hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well-dressed
With finesse in a white tee, lookin' for wifey
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive through the city, no doubt
But don't say my car's topless, say the titties is out
Newness, here's the anthem
Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot with
Push the pool stick in your new crib
Same hand that you hoop with, swing around like you stupid
King of the town? Yeah, I been that
You know I click-clack  where you and your mens at?
Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back

[Chorus]
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

[Verse 2]
This ain't rappin', this is Street Hop
Now get up off yo' ass like your seat's hot
My live niggas lit up the reefer
Trunk of the car, we got the streetsweeper
Don't start none, won't be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music defuse all the tension
Baller convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers can move swift
Girls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept
All my just-comin' homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phony
Pull out my waist, the Eagle four-forty

[Chorus]
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

[Verse 3]
I see niggas runnin', yo, my mood is real rude
I lay you out, show you what steel do
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight you punk-asses
Like Pun said: you ain't even en mi clasa
Maybach Benz, back seat, TV plasma
Ladies lookin' for athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose, whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is
Show me love, let me feel how the head is
Females who's the sexiest is always the nastiest

[Outro]
And I like a little sassiness
A lot of class; Mami, reach in your bag, pass the fifth
I'm a leader at last, this a don you with
My 9's will spit, niggas lose consciousness

[Intro: Jadakiss]
I need it from the top, ah!
This is history baby
Commissioner Steve Stoute
Lenny, ha!
God's Son, what up?
D-Block, what up?
Bravehearts, what up?

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yo ain't nothing but trouble, God, when I kick in the door
With D-Block, Bravehearts and the Double R
Don't make me let the machine off
This is methadone music that you can lean off
"Made You Look," the remix, with me up on it
I copped your shit, now I break weed up on it
And everything is real I see
Like my niggas that been home but they only got a jail ID
I helped the game, it ain't help me
I'm top five, dead or alive, and that's just off one LP
And I still buzz, they feel cuz
'Cause they know the flow's ill just like Will was
I'm just tryna make sure that my sons wealthy
Out of shape, but I make sure that my guns healthy
I'm a ape, you can't stand 'Kiss, comin through the hood
In a Aston Vanquish, the color of dandruff
They said we jumped him, I just let the gun snuff him
Copped P then turboed soon as they uncuff him
This goes out to all of your mans
Why put you in the verse when I can put you in a coroner van?
D-Block!

[Hook: Nas]
They shooting! Ah, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin big money, playboy your time's up
Where them gangsters? Where them dimes at?

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I'm from the school of hard knocks, sneak peeks and low blows
Where Xs mark spots and kitchens mark Os
Where love's gon' getcha and hate is gon' snitch ya
And fingers squeeze triggers like boa constrictors
It's the, Mr. Luda, Jada and Nas
And our bullets give you a deep-tissue massage
So hear a song and dance while I make these ends
You never stood half a chance like Siamese Twins (AH!)
They shooting! Look in the barrel!
Then he made the front page of the Miami Herald
Or Chi. Tribune, nozzles with silent doom
We in that A-Town Journal as violent goons
You should print my information, quote my rhymes
And keep me in between these New York and L.A. Times
I was the victim of society, it's 'Cris the Menace
With mo' shit out on the streets than evicted tenants, whoa!

[Hook: Nas]
They shooting! Ah, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin big money, playboy your time's up
Where them gangsters? Where them dimes at?

[Interlude: Nas]
Jungle! Wiz! Nashawn!
We got 'em scared, look!
We got 'em scared, they runnin'!

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, I grasp the ratchet, the blinker, the biscuit, the burner
The heat, the toaster, the twister, you meetin your owner
The banger, the hammer, the flamers I aim at the cannons
And can ya, manhandlin ya, you'll be famous, I'll cancel you
And cut, that's the end of your movie
Pretendin you actin like you and your mens'll come shoot me
My tennis shoes Gucci, old school, pea-soup green
Jean Lee suit on, Veuve Clicquot champagne
Friday the 13th my CD drop
I rhyme to more Base than EZ Rock, I'm Jason, call up P.D
Watch hem Bravehearts, Jungle and Wiz and Nashawn
Ill Will rasta Lake, never revealin his face on
TV or pictures or even them niggas
Sorry that I made you wait long, glad them fakes gone

[Outro: Nas]
We shooting! Squeezing them triggers with Luda beside me
Me and 'Kiss get Luniz of weed, set to Styles P
Tell him hold his head, God's Son got him we made y'all look
From San Quentin to Rikers Island to Green, Sing Sing...



[Intro: Jadakiss]
I need it from the top, ah!
This is history baby
Commissioner Steve Stoute
Lenny, ha!
God's Son, what up?
D-Block, what up?
Bravehearts, what up?

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yo ain't nothing but trouble, God, when I kick in the door
With D-Block, Bravehearts and the Double R
Don't make me let the machine off
This is methadone music that you can lean off
"Made You Look," the remix, with me up on it
I copped your shit, now I break weed up on it
And everything is real I see
Like my n**** that been home but they only got a jail ID
I helped the game, it ain't help me
I'm top five, dead or alive, and that's just off one LP
And I still buzz, they feel cuz
'Cause they know the flow's ill just like Will was
I'm just tryna make sure that my sons wealthy
Out of shape, but I make sure that my guns healthy
I'm a ape, you can't stand 'Kiss, comin through the hood
In a Aston Vanquish, the color of dandruff

[Instrumental]



[Verse 1: Nas]
Yeah, laced at Macy's, don't have it, a hatred addict
I need faces mad with frowns when I'm around, or I'm wasting fabric
I don't feel greater 'til my plush pieces, cause you to suck your teeth
So mean-mugging on my clean-thugging mean nothing
Women dream I'm your husband
I'm Alex Pushkin, the black poetry-writing Russian, ice disgusting
I started bling, how could you question my direction
Or my Tom Ford collection? Gangstas two-stepping
You hate me, should thank me, but lately
I burned so much trees, I keep environmentalists angry
I'm a rare dude, I'm a wonder, your best success is my worst blunder
Y'all livin' trendy on pennies, I cop plenty Fendi
Vivienne Westwood, I'm good
Get the whole Trump Tower top floor for the hood
Dre & Cool, we riding heavy, NY to Miami cause

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Nas]
We make the world go round
Now let's toast to the hustlers
We make the world go round
Tell the hustlers to toast to the gangstas
We make the world go round
Tell the gangstas to toast to the ballers
We make the world go round
And tell the ballers pour a glass for all us
We make the world go round

[Verse 2: The Game & Chris Brown]
I see the haters on the floor jocking my swag
I'm popping Ralph Lauren tags and pouring champagne inside a Polo glass
Model bitches rolling grass, Escobar unfolding cash
Toasting with my entourage, went from robbing armored cars
To all my stars, red carpet to the L'Ermitage
We throwing red dice at the Mirage
I pull that red Lamborghini on twenties out my garage
Set up shop in South Beach like Khaled and Terror Squad
(We The Best!) Big pimping, top down chrome spinning
"Top Gun", Tom Cruise tucked inside my Gucci linen
No [censored], just Romo
You tryna shine, I put the nine on your jersey for promo
Jessica Simpson, that's so-so
Nick want his (baby back), but that's Loso
Tell Hawaii Five-O to catch me at the Pro Bowl
On the field, diamonds choking the jockey on my Polo
CB, let 'em know though

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Nas]
We make the world go round
Tell the hustlers to toast to the gangstas
We make the world go round
Tell the gangstas to toast to the ballers
We make the world go round
And tell the ballers pour a glass for all us
We make the world go round

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
We make the world go round
From my town to your town
We on top, no stopping us now
We got Patron, the ballers two stepping
Ladies on the floor and all 'em two stepping
From L.A. to Harlem, two stepping
(From L.A. to Harlem, two stepping)
So iced out, it's easy to point them haters out

[Verse 3: Nas]
We start with Bellini's and end with Patrn shots
H. Lorenzo belt buckle from Chrome Heart
Alife tag popper, it'd be sad not to walk out the store with bags
Worth a hundred cash shopping
Violence only when have to, have to to swell you up
Prefer peach Schnaps, Perrier-Jout, a vanilla dutch
Mets cap, that's Queens, I'm a vet, bet that
300 carats the average up on the neck, black
Paid the cost, be the boss, Black Caesar floss
Weekends at the Venetian, pull up in that black Porsche
Top down, new fashion
Seeing me's like seeing through the lens of Helmut Newton's camera light flashing
And I'm laughing, my plaques' from album sales
Y'all is ringtone platinum but ninety-nine cents adds up
I don't hate 'em, I congratulate 'em
The new young Prince with young Mike Jackson on the same track
What!

[Chorus: Nas & Chris Brown]
Now let's toast to the hustlers
We make the world go round
Tell the hustlers to toast to the gangstas
We make the world go round
Tell the gangstas to toast to the ballers
We make the world go round
And tell the ballers pour a glass for all us
We make the world go round



[Intro: Future]
Dress it up and make it real for me
Whatever that fucking means

[Hook: Future]
Dirty soda in a styrofoam
Spend a day to get my mind blown
Dress it up and go to Nassau
200 miles on the dash
And gotta roll a pound up and gas it
Switching lanes in a Grand Rapide
We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas
Til these niggas start acting
Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie
Nigga, gone let 'em have it
Ballin' like the March Madness
All these cops shooting niggas, tragic
I'm the one that's living lavish
Like I'm playing for the Mavericks
I didn't wanna fuck the bitch, the molly made me fuck her even though she average

[Verse: Nas]
Reflect with radiance
Rising consciousness of my people in the stadiums
Or I can get ignorant like that nigga Maury Povich portray us as
I'm hip hop baby dad
And all of y'all my litter, my little kids
And my label's Mass Appeal
A blunt, a pill and some liquor
I get to my hitters, they spray your ass
Get money fast, R.I.P. the check, smell my kilo breath
I spit and I freeze you to death
Cuban tobacco mouth, trap nigga cologne
Been had the OG respect
Pick the city, I knock four of ya' baddest
16 chillin' with Supreme Magnetic
Fort Greene nigga with a little Queens bastard
Now I'm in a Ghost or a Benz or an Aston, icon status
And we still strapped case you niggas want static
Still ballin', still mackin'
Niggas ain't a 100, he 60/40
We 50/50, that's automatic
My niggas got open cases
But niggas got watches and bracelets
And cee-lo, I never throw aces
Don't give a fuck about racists
Pray that my niggas come out of the FEDs
Shout to my niggas who dead
We got the stripes
All I got is my real niggas for life
Nas pour henny, Future pour dirty sprite

[Hook: Future]
Dirty soda in a styrofoam
Spend a day to get my mind blown
Dress it up and go to Nassau
200 miles on the dash
And gotta roll a pound up and gas it
Switching lanes in a Grand Rapide
We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas
Til these niggas start acting
Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie
Nigga, gone let 'em have it
Ballin' like the March Madness
All these cops shooting niggas, tragic
I'm the one that's living lavish
Like I'm playing for the Mavericks
I didn't wanna fuck the bitch, the molly made me fuck her even though she average



[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh...

[Chorus]
(A mastermind) sees it coming before it comes
(A mastermind) before he go to war he counts his ones
(A mastermind) everything planned out perfect
In case y'all niggas got to get murdered
(A mastermind) sleeps at night real easy
(A mastermind) 'cause everything he does is by the book
(A mastermind) never do a thing irrational
Lives forever, these tales are classical

[Verse 1]
Velvet bow ties
Bulletproof's in the tux, when I roll by
In a car similar to Osama's, in my diamonds
And my principal is to study drama
Look what happened in Manhattan
A couple of, years ago when guns started clappin'
Two of my dogs fell, two of my niggas ran
They was amateurs in beef with a grown man
It taught me the lessons of how the strong stand
And how the weak end up in a coffin
Play it cool, that's the old school rule, man
Keep your ears to the street, you'll never lose, man
Make your enemies believe there's love there
'Cause in war, belief is all fair
Rock them to sleep, shots in your Jeep
And you ain't never know the plot was from me
It's from my masterminds

[Chorus]
(A mastermind) sees it coming before it comes
(A mastermind) before he go to war he counts his ones
(A mastermind) everything planned out perfect
In case y'all niggas got to get murdered
(A mastermind) sleeps at night real easy
(A mastermind) 'cause everything he does is by the book
(A mastermind) never do a thing irrational
Lives forever, these tales are classical

[Verse 2]
It ain't a game it's the life
Think it's a game, you lame
And I'm nice on that black stone Merlot
Toast to my hero Nat Turner
Weather below zero, gave the keys to Kelis
Whispered in her earlobe, "drive home"
'Cause she the wife and they the freaks
The underneath my girl caliber
They smiled at her and said "Goodbye"
With niggas who thug or die, they wild as us
My bodyguards in my Denali truck
Knowing that I'm surrounded by OGs
That I don't really get down with
They got a separate table for their freaks bought them drinks
So we could talk man-to-man so real niggas could link
I knew, they kill hoes too like Rae Carruth
They used to spray troops, now they managing groups
The main nigga Sonny had big money since '82
Had two of my dogs whacked, nothing I could do
That was back when I had no crew, I switched that
Now I'm strong with niggas who feel Sonny was wrong
My money's long, his money is weak, he's losing sleep
Trying to feel me out, to see what it's gon' be
But I'm a mastermind

[Chorus]
(A mastermind) sees it coming before it comes
(A mastermind) before he go to war he counts his ones
(A mastermind) everything planned out perfect
In case y'all niggas got to get murdered
(A mastermind) sleeps at night real easy
(A mastermind) 'cause everything he does is by the book
(A mastermind) never do a thing irrational
Lives forever, these tales are classical

[Verse 3]
I live a clean life, I don't even steal cable
I speak for myself, my niggas'll slay you
Lucky us, this rap done worked out fine
Feds, check me out, it's no dirt y'all find
This King of New York shit only last 15 minutes
Every nigga get burned, but it's what you did with it
Niggas who brilliant, came in and killed it
Made millions every three months, new jury
I'm low, smoking Blueberry with a ho
That know a few scary individuals, it's eerie as she get into it
Squares, they into voodoo
She says a Hail Mary, then she said she knew who
Would come and try to kill you too

[Chorus]
(A mastermind) sees it coming before it comes
(A mastermind) before he go to war he counts his ones
(A mastermind) everything planned out perfect
In case y'all niggas got to get murdered
(A mastermind) sleeps at night real easy
(A mastermind) 'cause everything he does is by the book
(A mastermind) never do a thing irrational
Lives forever, these tales are classical

[Intro]
Aight, fuck that shit! Word, word
Fuck that other shit, y'know what I'm sayin'?
We gonna do a lil somethin' like this
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
(Y'all doin' that other shit)
Keep it on and on and on and on and
Know'm sayin'? Big Nas, Grand Wizard, God, what is it?
(It's like) Haha,you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, go ahead and rip that shit, dun!

[Verse 1]
I rap for listeners, bluntheads, fly ladies, and prisoners
Hennessy-holders and old-school niggas, then I be dissin' a
Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-er
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, moneywise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up in trife life, the times of white lines, the high pipes
Murderous night times and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, cold strap
With my peeps that's into drug money market interact
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler
I guess that means peace
For niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rollin' mats for craps to cee-lo
With side-bets, I roll a deuce, nothin' below
(Peace God!) Peace God  now the shit is explained
I'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
It's like that, y'all

[Chorus]
"Now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"
"Now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"
"Now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"
"Now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"

[Verse 2]
One for the money, two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Aliz, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God, check the prognosis: Is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama
For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis, my razor embraces many faces
You're telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so
My pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say "Peace"
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
Yo, fuck, rap is real! Watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes, 'cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my vein
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

[Chorus]
"Now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"
"Now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"

[Outro: DJ Premier scratching]
"Comin' out of Queensbridge"
"Comin' out of Queensbridge"
"Comin' out of Queensbridge"
"Comin' out of Queensbridge"
"The most dangerous MC is"
"Comin' out of Queensbridge"
"The most dangerous MC is"
"Comin' out of Queensbridge"
"The most dangerous MC is"
"Comin' out of Queensbridge"
"The most dangerous MC is"
"Me number one, and you know where me from"



[Spoken: Nas]
Yeah, yeah
Brings me back
As you come outside on the block
The basketball court was crack and you still played ball
Shooting on the rusty rim
I lived on the fourth floor
Wow, remember those days like yesterday
Memories man
They feed the soul
Yeah

[Verse 1: Nas]
I rap for listeners, bluntheads, fly ladies, and prisoners
Henessey-holders and old-school niggas, then I be dissin' a

[Intro]
"This has once again proof that no routine police stop is actually routine. We saw that last week of course, in Brooklyn with the tragedy over there and then again last night here in Tottawa, another police shooting"

Here's what they think about you

"I hate little motherfuckers like you. Little niggers like shit! Think your tough, huh? Blow your head off, your little Smith and Wesson couldn't do shit. How you feel now?"

[Hook- David Banner]
Cops keep firing in my environment
Middle finger to the law nigga gripping my balls
Cops keep firing in my environment
Middle finger to the law nigga gripping my balls
Cops keep firing in my environment
Middle finger to the law nigga gripping my balls
I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong
Middle finger to the law nigga gripping my balls

[Verse 1 - Nas]
Now all you hypocrites, witness the injustice
Conversations taped illegally, then they cuff us
U.S. attorneys, public defenders send us off to hard prison time
Whether you innocent or did the crime
Say you come from who this cops pursue you hard
Run your plates, put guns in your face
Put you in the car, for nothing
Now your strugglin', tied up, standing in line-ups
Call your lawyer, they charged you with murder
Why? Cuz these liars said you shot another man on his driveway
Guilty, just for being black on a Friday
Polygraph test you failing, because you're nervous
Charged for murder you didn't commit, then they serve ya
Fifteen years, maximum security
Slashing, stab wounds, broken bone injuries
You were placed there intentionally
Either you bang or you miss me, listen to me

[Hook]

Im grippin' the Nina, visions of 9/11
Visions of three sixes, no sevens
This is Bushonomics, George is a modern day Ronald Reagan
I pray to god in the midst of Pagans
Niggers I'm just saying
When do we stop playing?
When do we stop pimping and start spraying?
50 shots for every cop that popped Sean Bell his body lay'in
But they acquit cuz they know
That our generation won't do shit! Nothing, nada
But every rapper is a shotta or a Don Dada
Or a killer, but you ain't killing nothing
And it's peace unless it's another nigga
Tryna raise boys to Superman
And while I'm at it fuck Arthur J. Cooperman
It's never justice for blacks but they send just us to Iraq
With poor whites and Latinos
I pray to God that you hear this single
This is Banner's middle finger y'all

[Hook]

[Outro]
You still want to be nigga too?
(*Gunshot sound)



[Intro]
{*Kissing*}
I love you so much, don't ever leave me, I won't let you leave

[Verse 1]
The hoe turned me out, green eyes, had a crush on her
Since 5 years old, met her, fell in love with her
I saved that hoe 'cause she bring more hoes
She major yo, the way she left them other dudes cold
Heartbroken, she walked right out of mad nigga's life
So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife
And I ain't gonna lose her like those other lames did
I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big
She keep me jig, glorifying medallions
Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions
Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked
She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks
Bankers and diplomats
She the scratch on my back
Her cream I lust, now I got her I don't know how to act
When she not around, I'm heated, 'bout to lay something flat
Know how to treat it, never take for granted, she got me trapped

[Chorus]
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich

[Verse 2]
All the fun we have together, I keep you in my pocket
It's so much of you I share you, and speak to you in private
You got me karats on my wrist
I'm a savage for your kiss
Embarrassed when I'm not with you, I'm off guard
Niggas always expect to see us two together, stable
The best couple they seen since Trump and Marla Maple
Don't need no pre-nup
'Cause when we hump we do it up
Make sure we both will bust a dollar sign nut
Before I got to know, my life I say was mediocre
Break of day, slinging all night long, fiending to stroke ya
Seeing niggas with you I wasn't happy
Wanted to stick them up to get you, heard you calling for daddy
And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife
Never divorce me, I promise to treat you right
Keep you satisfied, never lie help you grow
My legal tender, lovely federal reserve note

[Chorus]
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich

[Verse 3]
I won't sell my soul to you
What do I owe to you?
My cars, my house, my flow to you
Screw you, before you
Real niggas said I was cool, now I got you
The envy me cause I'm with you
You floss too much
Turn niggas out, one touch
For you, my guns bust
You always said in GOD we trust
It's hard enough to keep counting on you
You cheat with government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you
I think I liked you better when you were illegal
But you had to get professional, musical
Now when we fuck we use prophylactic, hard plastic
Stick you in ATM's, limited cash quick
Said you'd give me luxury, when I asked it
Fucking me, I gave you back shots in ya assets
Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me
I guess bitches like you just grow on trees

[Chorus]
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich



[Verse 1]
My niggas got scarred grills, skully hats and gats be fully's
Brrrat, cars peel, the East Coast cartel
Rats get their tails snapped and trapped
The snitches in the streets and the snitches who rap
Pure euphoria, a dose of death to all of ya
Coroner choruses sung from The Bridge to Astoria
Dreams of fallin' in the elevator, passin' floors
Suddenly stop, the doors open up to a brick wall
I can smell the haters, wishful thinkers, bad luck prayers
Picture your tarot cards and bodyguards getting sprayed up
Sabotagin' my makeup, my watches get laced up
Even if they indicted Jacob
Forensics, paramedics, carry cowards off
Defibrillators shock to your chest, try to cough
They die and hit Hell from an iron
I'm fly in YSL, I'm paid from this shit
Got bitches high as hell, and they fucking like AIDS don't exist
They get sent to your hotel, a maid and shit
Put a barrel in a capo mouth, 'til his scalp come out
You a kid, you don't live what you rap about
King poetic, too many haters to count
Too much paper to count, QB, bitch!

[Chorus]
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
(My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of, ha-ha)
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength

[Verse 2]
Got seven candles lit, black wallpaper, black carpet
Thinking about which nigga to target
You kill a nigga today, he lives forever
So I plotted out smarter, there'll be no martyrs
Black TEC on the table, Mag .44
Black negligee on my bitch, she's at the door
Black fish eggs, nigga, that's the caviar
You niggas fish-made, y'all niggas is fifth grade
Niggas, it's fifty ways to dissect the General
If I give ya the top five, you will not survive
Rule 1: cocksucker, keep my name from your tongue
Rule 2: thought you knew don't fuck with God's Son
Rule 3: see, matter fact, I just wait
If y'all reach top five, then I'ma eat y'all alive
Each one of you guys that claim Hip-Hop is still alive
Like y'all ain't in agreement with Nas
That shit is dead motherfucker, it's dead, bitch

[Chorus]
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
(My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of, ha-ha)
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength

[Verse 3]
From crack pushers to Lac' pushers and ambushers
And morticians to fortresses, case-dismisses
Laced in riches, cake ridiculous
From nickel and dimin' to trickin' them diamonds
Vegas, places in Switzerland
From non-blastin' to auto, I don't have to blast mine
They blast mine, black 9, you flatline, my cash climb
Buy rare art, antique pieces, Mona Lisa's, own no leases
Five-star restaurant eaters; don't forget who your peeps is
'Sposed to dine with you, sip that good wine with you
Only if they grind with you or slang for ya
Seen niggas live, laugh, party and die in that very same corner
Pretty girls glance at us, status unconceivable
Private planes landed out in Teterboro, weed I twirl
Once even gave me a phobia, that I be in a spot trapped like Madame Zenobia's with this kid eyein' my Rollie, y'all

[Chorus]
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
(My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of, ha-ha)
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength

[Outro]
There it is, QB, bitch! Yeah
QB, bitch! Yeah, yeah QB, bitch!



[Hook - Keyshia Cole]
I'm trying to put it all in words, but it's
More than I can say
It would take a whole lifetime to tell you
More than I can say
Every time I wrote a line its still
More than I can say
This is the realest shit I ever wrote
More than I can say

[Verse 1 - Nas]
Bottles and El Dorados, trapped in the allure
The sickness: dreaming of riches
Reality was the cure. My doctor
Physician was music, I'm sure
The prescription was super-model sandwiches
And suicide doors. I used to stand in my mirror
Fixing up my hat right
DMV don't make licenses for the fast life
Was taught never drop my head when I'm doing right
And though I may be watched by feds with the blue sights
I just want the whole world to bop their heads
Someone to stop my bread
If my pops was here, he'd be like "son, you the one
They gotta crown you, a gift from around you
Know they don't understand you, but what can they handle?
If they was wearing Gucci loafers, they'd be through, over
Just stay on point, do what you do
Soldier: remember I'm with you when the world get colder..

[Hook - Keyshia Cole]

[Verse 2 - Nas]
Keep having the same dream
About a mic, a gun, a cross, they all
In the middle of flames
An hourglass of salt dripping down to its last grain
Hear a voice that asks what do I claim?
I ask what it means. It's sort of a trance
As the planet Earth appears in the palm of my hands
I could do what I wish with it, and waking up
To study my dreambook, see if it links up
Looking for some significance, like does the dream
Represent this cold world I'm living in?
Ask my man, then his laughter begin
He had the same dream, but in his, he grabbed the gun
Damn son! I told him in mine I took the mic
The cross, I had it all my life, the same height
I'm trying to sneak sleep, so that my mind won't find out
Time out: my body won't wind down



Ay yo..you... You that just flipped on this C.D. player:
I just wanna inform you that when you got somebody good, you hold on to 'em

Must be nice... having someone who understands the life you live
Must be nice... having someone who's slow to take and quick to give
Must be nice... having someone who sticks around when the rough times get thick
Someone who smiles bright enough to make the projects feel like a mansion

Must be nice...having someone who loves you despite your faults
Must be nice...having someone who talks the talk but also walks the walk
Must be nice...having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too

Someone who loves you fa sho
You must remember to never let 'em go

'Cause even when your hustling days are gone
She'll be by your side, still holding on
Even when those twenties stop spinning
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear, she'll still be here

Must be nice... having someone you could come home to from a long day of work
Must be nice... having someone you don't have to show;
They know exactly where it hurts
Must be nice... having someone who trusts you...
Despite what they've heard
Someone as mighty as a lion, but still gentle as a bluebird

Must be nice... having someone you don't have to tell you don't wanna be wrong
Must be nice... having someone you can grow old with until God calls you home
Must be nice... having someone who understands that a thug has feelings, too
Someone that loves you fa sho, you never let em go!

'Cause even when your hustling days are gone
She'll be by your side, still holding on
Even when those twenties stop spinning (And they will stop one day)
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear, she'll still be here

'Cause even when your hustling days are gone
She'll be by your side, still holding on
Even when those twenties stop spinning
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear, she'll still be here

'Cause even when your hustling days are gone
She'll be by your side, still holding on
Even when those twenties stop spinning
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear, she'll still be here



Alchemist you know me man
I'm the type of nigga that write rhymes right on the spot in the studio
Soon as I hear the track, you know what I'm sayin'?
Word but I wanted to bring a couple of books to the studio today

Man I found these shits up in the crib man in boxes man
I don't even remember when I was writing these shits
Oor what's in these shits man probably a bunch of bullshit man
Fuck it check it

How can I trust you when I can't trust me?
Picture myself a old man a O.G
Some niggas will conversate with lairs all day time pass
(Nah lemme start somethin' else)

Soul on ice death threats given by clowns
I guess livin' is prison when you live around clowns
I'm hexed cursed worse I been blessed first I thought I was abnormal
'Cause I would overcome any tasked called to

So there it is I'ma prince I'ma get slain
Some do minor shit swear they on the top of they game
Ya rhymin' is called "Vagina Monologue"
It kinda supports theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue

Rarely y'all come in contact with the real
Since Pun passed he was the last shine of sun I could feel
Yo said there's a few left since music's expressions of life
Damn I wish I took more time to write in my book of rhymes

Oh shit Tina, I been lookin' for this bitch number damn
No this rhyme is weak, this is week I remember this bullshit right here
(My book of rhymes)
Gandhi was a what the fuck?

Gandhi was a fool, nigga fight to the death
The US Army is a school that teach ya plights of conquest
(I wonder when I wrote this, nah it's weak)
The money's ya religion sky the limit live life
Numbers is big business makes the poor live strife

The glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream
Through your existence become wealthy knowledge is king
Pimps and card sharks
Thieves murderers with hard luck

Addicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society
Cops that shoot blacks is routine for notoriety
Grow up watchin' well dressed niggas with charms
Beautiful ladies on their arms

Dangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas
Rubbing my lips with Campophenique
Still behind the ears wet turned out to be
Pioneers vets amongst hustlers crack sellers and lairs and squares
(Nah that was weak there)

My people be projects or jail never Harvard or Yale
Pardon me type in my two way while I'm chargin' my cell
It's hard to be iced up with Gucci
God poverty's real I can't fight you
'Cause you would sue me niggas be groupies

I see imitators tryin' to make albums spittin' my style
And they don't even realize that I notice they stealing Nas' shit
I pump some Rick James with that Teena Marie
My Nina lean on me like Swoop it's crap this can't be
My book of rhymes

This can't be my book of rhymes writing this bullshit
(My book of rhymes)
Nah neva that fuck that, aw why you laughin' Alchemist?
Huh you a funny nigga, naw yeah
(My book of rhymes)

I'm tellin' you I'ma come up with some new shit now
Fuck that I'ma write again now fuck that
I musta been high on some shit
Mmm what the fuck is this?

Look how we treat pregnancy women in the 'hood
Our values so low our values are no good
Things our mothers told us we shoulda heeded
'Cause now we need it, we older almost able t

I'm jealous of you how come you so beautiful?
Smelling fresh youthful intelligent while I'm stressin' and shit
Aiyo I envy you 'cause all you do is smile and things come your way
Such a innocent child is what some say

I get upset 'cause I just want to be treated the way you are
Like a star not a worry in this world thus far
But wait a minute we both need ya mother's attention
I must be crazy jealous of my own baby infant
(Kinda crazy)



[Intro: Nas]
American born, American raised, American made

[Chorus: Nas]
My country shitted on me (my country)
She wants to get rid of me (naw, never)
'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)
'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)
My country shitted on me (my country)
She wants to get rid of me (naw, never)
'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)
'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)

[Verse 1: Nas]
Ayo, it's packed on this Rikers bus
The tightest cuffs is holdin' me shackled
The life of a thug caught in the devil's lasso
On the streets I was invincible
Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew
What my pistol would do, a fuckin' killer
Mother's a dope fiend embarrassin' me
All in front of my friends
In the street smile with no teeth
I never knew daddy, heard he had a 72 caddy
Died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably 3
Why didn't my folks just die in this society
Why wasn't I a child of a doctor, who left stocks for me
Two little brothers, two sisters, them shorties gots to eat
Mother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me
I'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father
Whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers
Blurry visions of dad holdin' me high
It comes to me slowly, the words he would cry

[Chorus: Nas]
My country shitted on me (my country)
She wants to get rid of me (naw, never)
'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)
'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)
My country shitted on me (my country)
She wants to get rid of me (naw, never)
'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)
'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)

[Verse 2: Millennium Thug]
It is I that step up
Me that don't give a fuck, you that foe, then it's all over soldier
Hummers and Range's through the desert
Fuck a 20-inch, long as we got gas and we got water
Troopers lookin' for manslaughter
I gotta get back, for what they owe
Shoot 'em in the back for the get back
Lead through shit bag, hold tie gag
Forget the life had, now we all rebels
Everything burnt down includin' the ghetto
We can see 4 miles the land its major rubble
And debris from the earth as we knew crumble
Yo you could see the sea
And the stars look closer to me
I'm a mad man, this is a real life movie Mad Max
S-K's, AK's max, ABR's spittin' and it ain't a rap
My mommy dearest pray for me hopin' I come back, but yo

[Chorus: Nas]
My country shitted on me (my country)
She wants to get rid of me (naw, never)
'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)
'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)
My country shitted on me (my country)
She wants to get rid of me (naw, never)
'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)
'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)

[Verse 3: Nas (Millennium Thug)]
Yo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls
I got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, God
Brothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape
Some brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape
How is the war
And yo I'm wishin' I was in your shoes
Holdin' machine guns
Clean fun, shootin' dudes with fatigues on
Anywhere is better than this
It's America's plan every color of man inherits the shit
Yo I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares
I know the warden is readin' the scribe
(But yo I swear, it's a billion dollar business)
Courts, lawyers and jails
We all slaves in the system, I'm 'bout to rebel

[Verse 4: Millennium Thug]
There's not a bitch in sight
Or block bench, or black gate
Or gray fence, look who fucked it all up, Mr. President
I remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent
Now it's state of the art
I just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart
What a bloody mess, a slug fest
I just buried 8 of mine, at night I hear grown men cryin'
You know I'm spittin' mine
I ain't goin' out here, we gotta win
Every time I hear the wind I think a slug went in
I'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head
Catchin' my breath, watchin' my back
Smokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass
I don't know what they broadcast, the newsflash is fake
Everyday I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape
And if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say

[Chorus: Nas]
My country shitted on me (my country)
She wants to get rid of me (naw, never)
'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)
'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)
My country shitted on me (my country)
She wants to get rid of me (naw, never)
'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)
'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)

[Outro: Nas]
This goes out to Che Guevara;
A Revolutionary destroyed by his country
Just trying to fight for what's real
This goes out to my nigga Malcolm El-Hajj Malik Shabazz
Just trying to fight for what's real
This goes out to Martin, all about peace and destroyed by his own country
This goes out to everybody in the whole world
Just trying to fight for what's real
To Patrice Lumumba;
Just trying to fight for what's real and destroyed by his own people
This goes out to my hood niggas
Coming up everyday just trying to survive the only way we know how
But see we know too much now, and we seen too much now
So ain't nothing gon' to stop us now
To my country, to my country, my country, my country...



American born, American raised, American made

[Chorus 2X]
My country shitted on me (My country)
She wants to get rid of me (Naw, never)
Cause the things I seen (We know too much)
Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)

[Verse 1 (Nas)]
It was packed on the Ryker's bus
The tight cuffs is holdin' me shackled
The life of a thug caught in the devil's lap
On the streets I was invincible
Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew
What my pistol would do, a fuckin' killa
Mothers of dope fiend embarrassin' me
All in front of my friends
In the street smile with no teeth
I never knew daddy, heard he had a 72 caddy
Died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably 3
Why didn't my folks just die in this society
Why wasn't I a child of a doctor, who left stocks for me

Whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers
Blurry visions of dad holdin' me high
It comes to me slowly, the words he would cry

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2 (Millenium Thug)]
It is I that step up
Me that don't give a fuck, you that bold, then it's all over soldier
Hummers and Range's through the desert
Fuck a 20 years, long as we got gas and we got water
Troopers lookin' for manslaughter
I gotta get back, for what they owe
Shoot'em in the back for the get back
Lead through shit bag, hold tie gag

My mommy dearest pray for me hopin' I come back
But yo

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3 (Nas + Millenium Thug)]
Yo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls
I got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, God
Brothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape
Some brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape
How is the war
And yo I'm wishin' I was in your shoes
Holdin' machine guns
Clean fun shootin' ducks with fatigues on
Anywhere is better than this
It's America's plan every color of man inherits the shit
Yo I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares
I know the warden is readin' the scribe
[MT] But yo I swear, it's a billion dollar business
Courts, lawyers and jails
We all slaves in this business, I'm bout to rebel

[Verse 4 (Millenium Thug)]
There's not a bitch in sight
All block bench, all block gates
All gray fence, look who fucked it all up, Mr. President
I remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent
Now it's state of the art
I just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart
What a bloody mess, a slug fest
I just buried 8 of mine, at night I hear grown men cryin'
You know I'm spittin' mine
I ain't goin' out here, we gotta win
Everytime I hear the wind I think a slug went in
I'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head
Catchin' my breath, watchin' my back
Smokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass
I don't know what they broadcast, the news hash is fake
Everyday I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape
And if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say

[Repeat Chorus]

[Nas]
This goes out to Jake Rivera...
Revolutionary destroyed by his own country,just tryin to fight for whats real
This goes out to my nigga Malcom Alhazbalishibaz...
Just tryin to fight for whats real
This goes out to Martin...
All about peace and destroyed by his own country
This goes out to everybody in the whole world...
Just tryin to fight for whats real
To Petrish Lamoumba...
Just tryin to fight for whats real and destroyed by his own people
This goes out to my hood niggas...
Coming up every day just tryin to survive the only way we know how
But see we know too much now, and we seen too much now
So ain't nothing goin stop us now

[fading]
My country....
My country....
My country....
My country....



[Verse 1]
Word to Will, buried in his Fila suit and heavy chain
I wanna be iced-up, nigga, bury me the same
I live for street glory and I die for ghetto fame
Respect all, fear none, my pride is everything
Initials in swimming pools floors, women lose drawers
A true boss, never lose wars, got cheddar to floss
Guns under my bed, mask and a flashlight
Livin' my life like everyday's my last night
Alcoholic on toilets, I shit blood
Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug
Mommy told me from weed I would switch drugs
To cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs
How would she know unless she hit the clubs, got her mack on?
Back in the 60's with an afro and her platforms
Boppin' to The Supremes, smokin' joints
That's cool, but I'ma live how I want

[Chorus 1]
(I did it my way) from crumbs and roaches and rats
(I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps
(I did it my way) from break dancin', back spins on the cardboard
(I did it my way) to bullet proof Bentleys, Gats in the car door
(I did it my way) never gave a fuck what nobody said
(I did it my way) they hoped that I failed and wished I was dead
(I did it my way) if I fuck up, it falls on me
(I did it my way) I lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat

[Verse 2]
Gateways, marble floors, chandeliers
Jacuzzi's, Gucci soap, throwin' cash in the air
Though I still feel broke with millions in the bank
And deals on the table, I focus to stay afloat
And just to think some would die to get what I got
They think it's a lot; in the blink of an eye, you could get shot
Niggas is wolves, comin' if you ruthless or not
But I be on point, put you in places where bodies rot
Never knew murder 'til I seen my man get popped
No blood soakin', layin' there, eyes still open
I got a little closer, put my hand in his palm
He was lookin' right through me, yo, starin' beyond
I wonder what he saw: the limos, movies and tours?
Did he die in vain or represent for the cause?
Now I put his name on everything I'm involved
And that's the game; y'all can't relate, fuck y'all (Ill Will)

[Chorus 2]
(I did it my way) from crumbs, roaches and rats
(I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps
(I did it my way) I call it how I see it niggas
(I did it my way) if you don't like it, so be it niggas
(I did it my way) I make my own rules, do my own plans
(I did it my way) gangstas do what they want, suckers do what they can
(I did it my way) takin' sacrifices kid
(I did it my way) you only gettin' one life to live

[Verse 3]
Yo, hoes in my focus slow me; roll with the brokest homies
Cold and we hopeless lonelies, scoldin' my foes who phony
From blocks where coke'll feed you, and cops is over-evil
They know some people who tell on felons who sold some diesel
Her-on and blow, it ruins minds, knew a crew one time
'89, they took work to Caroline and blew big time
In just two years, their crew disappear
Snitches and bitches smeared the paint on their pictures
Years back, I reminisce and remember
Sittin' on wood benches gave me splinters
Just a baby nigga thankful
When them killers came through, guns out, movin'
I thank the ones who said
"Shorty, go home, we about to be shooting"

[Chorus 1]
(I did it my way) from crumbs and roaches and rats
(I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps
(I did it my way) from break dancin', back spins on the cardboard
(I did it my way) to bullet proof Bentleys, Gats in the car door
(I did it my way) never gave a fuck what nobody said
(I did it my way) they hoped that I failed and wished I was dead
(I did it my way) if I fuck up, it falls on me
(I did it my way) I lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat



[Intro]
Aiyyo whattup niggas?
Fresh off the honeymoon
The honeymoon's over
Fresh off vaca' (Yeah, yeah)
I'm jet-laggin', still jet-laggin'
But this just a preview
Let's get it on again y'all

[Verse]
I designed it, rhymed it, flow classic
You askin' who am signed with?
The real deal's Ill Will, stay scomit
Why's drama when other artists pay homage
You hatin any rapper I do a song with
"What's wrong with Nas helpin' crews get stronger"
You selfish, wantin' me to yourself
But prophets need help too, y'all see Nas get insulted
I ride for the real shit, High as the Lock's get melted
Twelve Years, givin' you nuttin' but big moments
How can Murda Inc not wanna fuck wit
The top hustler - R.O.C. crusha
Nas a legend 'fore BIG & Pac left us
Bubbled wit Dr. Drizze, you heard it on Makaveli
Sayin': "Nas is ring leader, brings Ether, brings heater"
Your dream teamer scream, "He's the Supreme Teacher"
Similar to anybody you know
Oh, I created, cremated, bodied that flow
Anyone you think is fuckin' wit me
Better be vets, better be Ra, better be Kool G, or KRS
Better be LL, or Slick or them
Neva put me in the Top Ten, bitch!
It's disrespect to the life that burnt the verses
Or nigga writes who comes first
It's the Ice Cube, MC Shan, them type dudes
So BET's list was wrong, don't get me wrong
I did chill in the throne alone so long
This is my My Will

[Outro]
Yeah, Escobaro Cigars, that's how we doin' it
Ayyo Quan, welcome to the game!
Shot-out to Ill Will (This is my my will)
Bravehearts stand up! Whuttup Scarface?
Whuttup Tre Williams? (This is my will)
Ill Will '05, what y'all know 'bout that?
Queens, Queens I know you miss me
I gotchu, I gotchu Queens, New York stand up!
Aha, I gotchu baby, let's do it again!



[Intro: Nas]
Yea, uh, uh, real niggas dawg, ya heard
Yea, journey to the life, just journey

[Verse One: Nas]
I'm the nigga that ain't loud
Throw C-low, never ace out
Only move out wit a particular crew, I hate crowds
The observer, money and murder the hood praise it
I was raised in it, early age
Was presented with the ultimatum
Be a boss with a army, drop the Atari games
Hard cocaine that had my neighborhood strung out
Brains numb out, guns out
I was smart high hopes in my heart
But dope cartels would emerge
Bloody shirts on niggas while they hollerin'
'Til their lungs don't work
Figures I end up with a scarred memory of my youth
With dudes in the drug loot, feelin' henny "SHOOT"
My nigga Will still here, man I wish it was truth
Buried in his favorite shit, FILA sneakers and FILA suit
My eyes are the window of my soul
My niggas let the Indo roll
Thinkin' time flies we gettin' old
That's the words of my right hand man, my main dawg
We been rollin since day one, he down for the cause
All he talk is extortion, kidnap shit, big gat shit
I'm like - "yo think positive", but he act sick
He only think about lettin' his Mac spit
He like fuck who he hit
Me it bothers, cause he know I'm rent 'em it regardless
If he keep wildin' out he's makin' both of us targets
So I pull him, tell him on some deep shit, try to school 'em
We already lost niggas by how we was movin'
We still livin', but our lives need much improvin'
I think I'm gonna lose 'em

[Hook: Nas]
I was blind in this world
All I thought about was diamonds and pearls
I had beef wit a nigga, then I'm clappin' his girl
Nappin' his kids, ransack and run through his rib
Blow up his mom's crib, there's no way he could live
It's gettin' clearer, starin' at the man in the mirror
Like all this time, it's just a fragment of my mind
Come to find out, shit wasn't what is made to be
In reality +My Worst Enemy+ was me

[Verse Two: Nas]
Feelin' like I got the dons clout
Trigger pawn cocked Glocks spray up your moms spot
I ain't playin' wit you, war, fuck pistols
Bring machines, icy bell buckles, ten guns, M-1'S with ice muzzles
Life's a struggle, get your wifey touch too, everybody involved
Homicide, doctors patchin' up your war scars
Task Force chargin' at us, news flash, thug crews blast at officers
Coroners pick you up from the grass
Livin' fast 'til somebody tries meltin' my chest
I'm high loosin' it, could of hit my own self with the tec
Refuse to quit, but I tried tellin' me to relax
It's like I can't hear my words 'til I'm trapped to the max
Even then I blame everybody else except me, pops left me
I was just three, I cried for help, moms was busy
That don't mean nigga's stupid
But I got a habit wit - makin' up excuses
Was born ruthless, hated school, they ain't teach me I'm a bad seed
Planted in this ghetto, where my niggas can't read
Multiply, subtract; only knowin' how to count cracks and count stacks
Now what y'all know about that
One side of me wanted out of this life
Glue traps on the floor for the mice
'Til the nigga saw the light
I wanted money when I got it, I would spend it
I wanted jewels, but when I heard it, yo I wouldn't listen
All of the drama in my life I got my self into
All the toxins my body took in, faded my mental
I let these niggas words get to me
But I'm tired of my ice, tired of Bentley
It's the end of the century
I recognized the world is a beautiful place
Niggas opinions ruinin' my musical taste
Cause everytime I caught a case, could of got me in jail
If you wasn't scared of jail, you more likely to fail
I thought the whole world was cursed, from the hand I was dealt
And +My Worst Enemy+ was my self
Word to my self...word to my self...word to my self...

[Hook: Nas]
I was blind to the world
All I thought about was diamonds and pearls
I had beef wit a nigga, then I'm clappin' his girl
Nappin' his kids, ransack, run through his rib
Blow up his mom's crib, there's no way he could live
It's gettin' clearer, starin' at the man in the mirror
Cause all this time, it was a fragment in my mind
Come to find out, shit wasn't what is made to be
In reality +My Worst Enemy+ was me



Word word word word

[Nas]
I come through in a new double R listening to smiling faces
Check out my jewelry piled in your faces
Italian air forces leather laces with the basket weave
Iron in your face so fast from the draft so sneeze
It's the nastiest, flashiest, turn girls to masochist
Cause I be giving them pain, it's a cold world, I laugh as if
Bernie Mac will be snappin' on you
But I ain't a joke; you think I'm here to entertain you
Fallen angel after them halos
Nobody moves until I say so, take the money out the safe slow
Escape route and I'm out, I cake out like Entenmann's and Breyers
The flyest

[Hook]
You got to be the flyest
I know your ass is mean, like you be strappin them
Jeans, but you can work it like that
You got to be the flyest
You just take my pumps while standing in your pumps
Cause you can work it like that
You got to be the flyest
You just breathe and stare while I'm pulling your hair
Cause you can work it like that
You got to be the flyest
You can be Nas's angel, let the largest train you but
You work it like that

[Nas]
Uh, Philly rap a hydro, puffing on a line slow
Your CD needs me, keep it kickin' like Del Greco
Pull up at the Delano South Beach I know
For King Solomon jury security in the Tahoe
Spandex for money, I stay on the tight
G-packs and weed stacks stay on the flight
Elbow out the left window, K's on the right
Canary out her ears, you know she playing them right
Hilton style, Billionaire Boys club
Braveheart, y'all don't want no war with us
Dump a semi out a Maybach, I made girls bust
When I hit them full thrust, full throttle

[Hook]

[Nas]
Big living, what it tastes like, tapes right, used to hate life
To move an eight, every night was my passion
Pipe bombs safe from stashes, Aston's, Rolls Royces
Cold oysters and many sorts of women shake like horses
I got them peeling out their clothes, really about this dough
Problem, hear me out just scone from my pistol poppin'
It's at my mind, just a mystery school
Brainwash them, then fix them with my tools
Mami hit me with some moves
I'm addicted to spinning, dipping these women in different waters
Watching for dudes with tape recorders on them cause they informants
I been okay with these warmers
Girls harass me and gas me and say that I'm enormous

[Hook]

Move your waist girl.. Yeah yeah (x2)
You got to be Nas's Angel
You can be Charlie's Angel
You can be Nas's Angel



Anyone know the beat in the background when nas is talking?

[Intro: Nas & Dr. Dre]
Motherfucking Dre, whassup my nigga
Sup Nas
Chilling God
Niggas is up in here hittin' some of this chronic, nigga
Yeah and this chocolate over here, they mixed this shit up
Nigga, hit some of this shit, nigga
Yeah, lemme get that, I'm tired of these niggas
Niggas stealin' beats and niggas is stealin' your whole techniques and shit, niggas wanna take everything from a nigga man
Yeah yeah yo Nas it's like this man
Niggas can't do it like I do it, d'yaknahmsayin'
Just like niggas can't do what you do
Right, right
You know, can't nobody fuck with this
You know all these niggas out here just
Talkin' this East coast West coast bullshit
Niggas need to kill that shit
And make some money, y'know
Word
Fuck it
What is it, what is it God
Let's get together, make some fuckin' music
Right, that's what I'm sayin', that's what I'm sayin'
And get paid, and just, let that be it
All these niggas talkin all this bullshit
Better sit back, and watch what happens

[Verse 1: Nas]
The Golden Child chop that ass up, you was holding out
Let the streets be the court and corners hold the trial
Fatal not fictitious
I rock the cable '86 shit
Foreign cars young with crazy bitches
Mad smoke makes me able to quote
Soliciting ill editions of that Murder I Wrote
A provocative plan can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on top of the sand
In the heat of the moment
Like Farrakhan said we need atonement
Bulletproof glass, S-classes chrome kitted up
Calicones lit it up
I didn't get touched checking my nuts
I stood up and lit a Dutch
Clutching gats quick to bust
But knowing how these niggas tattle
I sneak move get the drop, one shot without the gun battle
So when you run the lead travel
I come through it's taboo
Ninety-six ways made to clap you

[Chorus]
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is comin

[Verse 2: Nas]
In the black limo, Jack Daniels through the cracked window
I spot the fake, red dot his face like a Hindu
Snatched the symbol, tied his hands to make examples
Substantial amounts you owe to the firm
Crew, Firm affliation, paper chasing
Chips glossy, rich Pablo Escabano
Sophisticado, blazing hollows like Saddles
Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro
Compared to these niggas who swear to be real
But impostors to Hoffa
Nas plague kills
Counting bills to send to all my jail niggas who fell
From New York to LA, QB to CPT for GP
A hundred G cars
Garcia Vegas cigars
Kani shit, mad jiggy
The clout, murder material serial scratched out
My name's passed out like it's something venereal
But back in stereo

[Chorus]
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is comin

[Verse 3: Nas]
From childbirth to hearses, flow like the Nile cover surface
I bit the fruit from the Serpent
Apocalyptic, get bent stay splifted
Control the rap game you got it twisted
Dr. Dre way, the Bridge say, shake dice and kiss it
Sip Cris' push the six with biscuit
Jeep full of chickens, pull up beside, have a listen y'all Nas y'all
Fly gangsta wavy hair teeth chipped in
My shit bump in the courtroom drunk, links truck
Rocky bracelet, cognac kernel never chase it
Rap hero black DeNiro
Federal Bureau tapped my line and got zero
Rap pro diamond roll, hustling low
Pro-file white gold style, raking bloody dough by the pile
Shot down still alive he struggling for the phone
Fo-fo blow him, when homicide comes
These three words are sung

[Chorus]
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is comin

[Outro: Dr. Dre]
Check this out, it's Nasty Nas, and Dr. Dre
East meets West
That's how we making it happen
That's how it goes down for the nine-six
Ayo Nas let's get this money
Let's get paid
Sit back and watch all these motherfucking clowns out here
Riffing and beefing about this bullshit
Yo while they doing all that
We just gon' kick back with these honies
This Cristal and party to the year 2G

[Chorus]
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is coming

[Intro]
(Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is;
Nas is like; Nas is like; Nas is like)
Umm, Premo, Nas
Yeah, yeah, yo
(Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is;
Nas is like)

[Verse 1]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
Same time a man is murderedthe beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10s to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs living large, taking in light
Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course N-A-S are the letters that spell (Nas, Nas, Nas)

[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (Uh)
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel (Uh, uh)
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (Uh)
No doubt (Uh)

[Verse 2]
(Nas is like) Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
(Nas is like) Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death - the last one left
Let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blasting TECs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos, but what's it all worth?
Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Making choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is

[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (C'mon)
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt (Uh)

[Verse 3]
(Nas is like) Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
I'm like beef, busting heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt, learning something deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
Always got you, Im like pop dukes you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races
Combined in one man; like the '99 Summer Jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam
I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it in your system every night, now

[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt (Uh); Nas is like

[Intro]
Uh, 2000 G

[Verse 1]
Yo, I need an encore y'all, you should welcome me back
You wanna ball 'till you fall, I can help you with that
You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat
'Cause I'm a wild barbarian, too hard, I'm scaring 'em
Century 21 solar eclipse
While you listening to the words that I wrote on the disc
Thelonius, my description is doo-rags, pants sag down to my feet
AK is my heat, everyday in the street 'til I lay six feet
QB, PJs, and we playing for keeps
Jewelry, cars and Jeeps is my motto
Four-fives with the hollows, silencers on the nozzles
Pop bottles with those who left here
The best years, wearing a bulletproof vest years
The aim for the head and chest years
What's your name? Make your name known
For the next year's, better rep, yeah

[Chorus]
Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus

[Verse 2]
I let y'all niggas bang my shit before Saddam hits
Let Nastradamus tell us what time it is
I was the first one on that Don shit
First nigga to sing a hook on some TJ Swan shit
Black ski masks up in the projects, camoulflage, full clips
Run up in your crib, tie up your bitch
Weigh the bricks and we loco, so broke, brown coke won't sell
Spending your money on weed, smoke and hotels
Hood rats and bullet wound up females
Got babies by hustlers and niggas in jail
Slinging for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips
Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit
A week later, sporting Gators, getting thrills
Our honies wearing Gucci high heels
She come to scoop me, I chill
Leave the streets alone for a sec
Hit the sky bar on sunset, then the sex is so high-tech
Uh

[Chorus]
Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus

[Verse 3]
Now, lounge homeboy, you in the Godly zone
Rest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's on the throne
And we gon' rep it the best that we can
Physically, you was killed by the weapons of man
But where you at now, you lamp, laid and max now
Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend
And they don't understand how you CEO from heaven
But that's another level, brethren
Two G's, we got the type fam with MAC-11's
We do squeeze, thought it's not right
But that's the zone that we left in
Bentleys, Porches, Piaget watches
Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless
Laptops with 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes
And we all roll dice, for each other's ice
And how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?
But only one man, only the mind's eye can understand that I'm...

[Chorus]
Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar

[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Intro: Nas & Big Kap]
(Y'all ready for Nas?
Queensbridge, y'all ready to see Nasty Nas?
Uh huh, they ready)
Yeah, word
Got some Rmy Martin
And some good-ass cigars, check it out

[Verse 1: Nas]
Ayo, late night, candlelight, fiend with diesel in his needle
Queensbridge leader, no equal
I come from the Wheel of Ezekiel
To pop thousand-dollar bottles of Scotch
Smoke pot and heal the people
Any rebuttal to what I utter get box-cutter'd
Count how many bad honeys I slut, it's a high number
Name a nigga under the same sky that I'm under
Who gets money, remain fly, yeah, I wonder
Eyes flutter, it's love when Nas pops up
Stars get starstruck, panties start drippin'
The ways of Carlito, blaze, torpedo cigars
Drop Rolls, hoes drop clothes
Louis the XIII, freaks, women nice size
I ride like Porsches, thick, brown and gorgeous
It ain't my fault, semi-automatic weapons I brought
The world crazy, I'm rich and I'm girl-crazy
Dick 'em, convince em all to praise me
They ideology is confusion, I lose 'em
Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety
Since the Tunnel and Skate Key, my jewelry in HD

[Verse 2: Nas]
Silent rage, pristine in my vintage shades
I'm not in the winters of my life or the beginning stage
I am the dragon
Maserati, pumpin' Biggie, the great legend
Blastin', I'm after the actress who played Faith Evans
My little Jackie Onassis, dig?
I'm so high I never land like Mike Jackson's crib
Vest on, .45 still crack ya rib, sacrilege
Talk trash 'bout the Nasty kid
Past nasty now, I'm gross and repulsive
Talk money, is you jokin'?
Cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa
In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket
On the floors, ceilings, the safe, bitch, I got it
You envy, but don't offend me
I'm skinny, but still I'm too big for a Bentley
You are your car, what could represent me?
Too Godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly
Must design me somethin' Tommy Mottonic from Queens had before the 90's
Drug dealer car, rush to the bar
Move, niggas! We don't give a fuck who you are
Black card heavy like a magnet in my stitched denims
Pretty women see them saggin'
Bet a hundred stacks niggas'll run it back
Just havin' fun, I ain't even begun to black
Light another blunt in fact, haha...

[Interlude: Nas]
(Nasty) Nasty kid
(Nasty) Yeah...
(Nasty) The kid! (Nasty) Yeah...
(Nasty) Nasty kid (Nasty)

[Verse 3: Nas]
For the hustlers, thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it
Got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin'
Saying, "It was Nas I used to hustle with"
I display fashions while my lungs engage hashish
Guns on my waist, past this
Since I'm cakin' up, put funds in my safe, laughin'
And joinin' the blunt passin' you niggas was straight assin'
Excuse the vulgarity, I'm still not fully adjusted
Or used to the new fans hearin' me spit rapidly
I never see the whips niggas be claimin' they drivin'
I guess entertainment means blatantly lyin'
Fake it 'til you make it, I've driven those toys
Been in them wars, in the streets, cops kickin' in doors
For my team nigga, your flow cheap as limousine liquor
Im no fake rap CD listener, sit back and roll a mean swisher
For my G's, tell these clowns make room for the king, nigga



[Verse 1]
It ain't hard to tell, I excel and prevail
The mic comes in contact with the third rail
My raps react, they attack the whack just like a maniac
With this, see I'm a brainiac
I'll call you tattoo, you never come off
I flip the script with a sawed-off, boss
A modern Shakespearereincarnated
Brains are elevated, I'm bein' R rated
This style is terror, drastic
Meltin' the plastic, and I eat mics just like acid
Burn your pen and pads, mics you'll need not
'Cause I be packin' like a Rasta in a weed spot
Hittin' your heart with a hollow-tip verbally illin'
Minds manipulated, my raps are nickel-plated
I execute raps like I'm swingin' an axe around
This is a mic shut down
Notify the Presidentthat I'm bombin' your residence
And I'm leavin' no evidence
Voice box yells, lyrics'll excel
Rappers gettin' smoked, you can smell the hot shells
Your style is fake, snake, well dramatized
You might as well be a singer but ain't harmin' Nas
Here's the break, I can translate lyrics so well
I excel, it ain't hard to tell

[Hook]
It ain't hard to tell

[Verse 2]
I got a case of vocal fever, I'm here to make you a believer
Nas wrecks the tweeters and receivers
Lyrics will explode, my brain overloads
Gimme a Grammy, competition is dead just like Sammy
I leave minds magnetized like slaves
Your style is old fashion like waves
Holdin' a pistol at a pastor, pullin' the trigger faster
Tell 'em I was sent by his Master
But that topic's too deep for your ear
Here's the science you can comprehend clear
Advanced intellectual, a time bomb speeder
I'll know your whole card just like a palm reader
Non-stop, I'm bustin' heads like the FEDs baby pops
This is not the Kindergarten Cop
Put on your blindfold, I'ma release and stand tall
I detonate bombs at the Policeman's Ball
This is art from the heart, I leave 'em marked for death
In each breath, in this game, I'm the ref
Already I'm ill but I can only get better
With lyrics as pretty as a nickel-plated Beretta
I master dialects, of uncommon languages
A black man caught by the Klan couldn't hang with this
These are proverbs, copy cat attackers, huh
I'm wanted dead 'cause I'ma genocide to rappers
Battlin' Nas is dead when my brain reacts
You might as well have fell asleep on a train track
This ain't the same track that you're used to
This is rhythmatic, automatic, try it, you oughta have it
Slaughter your tape recorder; givin' thanks to my supporters
And keep flowin' like water
No matter the obstacle, Nasty Nas will prevail
Ayo, it ain't hard to tell

[Hook]
It ain't hard to tell

[Verse 3]
Check it
I catch wreck with my intellect, suckers are incorrect
I'm gonna win 'cause you slept
On Nas, word is bond, I leave the microphone torn
False rappers, you need to write your own song
Metaphors are murder, man, hittin' like Roberto Duran
Hold the mic in my hand, my life span
Imitators will sweat me like gym class
Your raps are fat, shit, then I'll be Slim Fast
New rap recruits I salute then delete 'em
Verbally eat 'em, because my ears don't need 'em
Nas is a terrorist, analyst
Swingin' my fists like a nigga breakin', possessed by Satan
You couldn't compete with a beat that was fast or slow
Brothers is gettin' shipped out like I was Castro
I can eat your flavor but I'm not a candy lover
I use a Lethal Weapon, just like Danny Glover
Execute monologues, sabotage entourage
Mutilate mics like a maniac at large
I talk with slang, and use my brain
Generate pain, penetrate your vein
Move like a maniac, Nas is nice, son
Talk to your conscience and hit like Tyson
No competition, 'cause I cause wonders
Nas will battle rappers by the football numbers
A motor mouth killer, rhyme writin' thriller
Hold a Mac-11, and attack a reverend
Don't sleep 'cause you might not wake
I speak deep, dialects I translate
Me and friends commit sins on the regular
Murder my competitors, and et cetera
Nas is a gypsy Egyptian
Flippin' the script and microphone manufacturers are victims
My voice makes your ear drums swell
It ain't hard to tell



[Verse 1]
Queensbridge, 41st side
Yo yo yo
I gots no birth records, no next of kin
Know a lot of mothafuckers, got no best friends
Know the weather checkin 1010 WINS AM
First and fifteenth I'm layin at the check cashing
Think I'm playin, blink and I'm sprayin
Wrong move, ask yourself what leg you wanna lose cuz you gon' lose
I cripple niggas, from the complex to simple niggas
Keep showin y'all what difficult is
Half the world sayin "Dunn" but never been to the Bridge
What type of shit is that, fraudulence, what's the cause of it
Nature came threw erasing all of it, stop the presses
Goofy niggas ask a lot of questions
I repeat this is not a question
If you don't reply quick enough I gotta press em
Keep the Glock by the intestines, .38 waist
Wit a belt, regardless of your stats you can catch a shell

[Hook]
Believe me when I tell you this (Believe me when I tell you this)
There's nuttin y'all can do for me (There's nuttin y'all can do for me)
I don't believe in selfishness, this time I want my crew to eat (My crew)
We comin through a hundred strong (Comin through a hundred strong)
We comin wit a hundred miles (A hundred miles)
Bumpin shit all summer long (Bump that)
We want it dead and want it now (We want it now)

[Verse 2]
Yo aiyyo I rap for my niggas and rap for the hoes
Rap when I'm gettin dressed, when I iron my clothes
Depressed, I kick raps that change your whole mood
And somehow stick to your ribs like soul food
Rap for wheelchairs, rap for canes
Ace bandages and niggas wit sprain, stay limpin in pain
I rap for math, english, even rap for science
Gotta try to laugh, keep myself from cryin
I rap for Giants, the Jets, the Yankees, the Mets
It's New York New York, from Clue to Flex
New cassettes stay poppin up, your boo let me throw my cock in her
Rappin got me two proper nuts
It's crazy, I even rap for high school coach
White folks fiend out like in Michael Doates
Creamed out, dope stashin
For those askin, I flow for TV, HBO and closed caption

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo
Don't go to Texas, don't go to Watts
Don't go to Queensbridge, nigga don't go to cops
Don't snitch when you're gettin bagged
In the penns, don't bitch when you gettin stabbed
Just hold that, I pose for Kodak's, rose to stardom
Hoes in Harvard, sophmores get knocked off, nigga watch yours
I watch the game like it's Saint John's
It ain't wrong, take a blank piece of paper, a pen paint songs
Type colorful, writin that shit a thug'll do
In the heat of the moment, type to make a sudden move
Some'll snooze, some'll snore, they won't admit that dunn is pure
Once I quit, niggas wanted more
Cop my shit once it come in store
The first week be at the top of the charts, got it jumpin off
Hot verses wit a hundred thoughts
One theme, gettin caught in my zone you'll become a corpse

[Hook



*Man laughing*

[Verse 1: Nas]
I had bad chicks that blow cum bubbles like bubblegum
Plus they ass lick, summer house be sippin' rum
Layin' lazy in the recliner, couple days
In my ashtray, smoke signals from the haze
I stick my finger through it, the ring of smoke broke
That symbolize weak guys, pop the strong link off
The infrastructure caves in, amazin'
I ain't have to read The Art of War to slay men
Serve niggas, bird niggas speakin' reckless
When their momma love the kid's records I made
You gutless, you don't know struggle
Throw a couple shells at you, hell grabs you
Nail stabs a hand of the Nasirine
I carried the cross to help you afford that plasma screen
Gave you chumps a path to walk, hold my hand
I'mma guide you like the OG, but don't talk, don't get it confused
Cause none of y'all can fit in my shoes
Y'all made of chemicals, artificial actions
God'll forgive you bastards
Only if you repent to the Nazareth Savage

[Verse 2: Nas]
I squeeze nipples like pimples to get the puss, get it?
Form a crew, swallow forty cal. bullets after dinner's finished
Wash it down with a shot of tequila, pocket full of scrilla
Can't come close to, Francis Coppola, Samson -- no Delilah
You're pint-sized, I'm Mike's eyes with the gladiator tattoos on it
You scared to look too long at, sit on a don's lap
Tell you a story shorty, spicy like Lawry's
Chickenheads and orgies, criminals that draw heat in their late forties
Drug habits, love grabbin' kids up like yours
Sendin' you a picture of them in their drawers with black eyes
Savage guys, you hire Magnum PI's to bag up my guys
Said you was a thug with a good disguise, try to protect your cabbage
You're runnin' from the Nazareth Savage

[Verse 3: Nas]
Son's back with flows, they say mine is very scary
Smell fear like a canine that finds buried babies
And all of y'all wear that same aroma
How to blow on your eighth LP, I'll show ya
You're wack nigga, face it
In the history of the game, you have no placement
Liquor and weed just massacred their mind, or thee celebrity
Or they couldn't change with time, so now they run they mouth
But when the sun go south, them guns come out
My cavalry woulda been through ten in your skin
Casualty you don't wanna be, don't want it with me
Straight savage



[Intro: Nas]
Man, we love you man, you hear me?
This is coming from the General man, Nas man
Bravehearts love you man, this is to all of ya niggas
Who been using my name from day one to make yourselves famous
Whether you shouting me out on your records
Whether you try to come at me on your records, or whether you just you know...?
You know... you know how you dick riding man? This goes out to ya
Cause we love you man, I've done made a lot of niggas famous man
But I'm gon' make you...I make you make the papers, this one's for you
Ayo, word up
It been a lot of times when a nigga ain't wanna fuck with this rap shit no more
Fuck this shit, but you know...? Through the year I started to see shit, you knowamsayin?
Nigga see niggas driving around with fancy cars, diamonds, all that shit
Niggas thinking a nigga chilling
Got to go through a whole bunch of big shit, all that bullshit
But you know what? Fuck that shit, you know how I feel? Yo

[Chorus: Nas]
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's the life baby, you gots to understand it's life baby
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's the life baby, you gots to understand it's life baby

[Verse 1: Nas]
I got the mansion and the nice ride
Platinum chain, and an ice watch
All this fame in my life's hard
I entertain in so many places
See so many different faces
They look the same from the stages
After the concert, hours of long work
Home sick from the road, smoking my lungs hurt
Even though now I'm recording songs
It's better than, when I was peddling, doing wrong
I brought the crew along, we thugging
Fucking married bitches; they go to their husbands
Bitches ain't shit, we laughing with them
Can't even role the streets now, without the heat
I bust the nigga off impost, that shit is weak
On trial, what I'ma tell the judge
He don't give me no smile, he don't give me no love, nor the jury
That's when I need celeb status and the blackness
This motherfucker's hate rappers, what a life

[Chorus: Nas]
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby

[Verse 2: Nas]
My girl hate when I'm with my boys
Think I'm cheating, every morning knocking at my door
State policeman, give him a reason, but I don't give it to him
They said they heard a disturbance, and I just listen to him
See, I cooperate until they push me
Cops hate when you know the law, you ain't pussy
You not fake, can't explain how much I miss the block
When we was slinging with my niggas, screaming "Fuck the cops!"
Now when I'm dreaming I can see my dead friends smile
Wake up, I get some air, hit the mall for a while - pick up some gear
I'm going to the studio; my engineer put the track up from "out west"
And he told me spit it clear
Another hit just made, another album
So ones again we getting paid, and now we wilding
Get hype to shoot the video, all in the city yo
I'm hoping that a nigga blow, but ya don't hear me though

[Chorus: Nas]
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby

[Verse 3: Nas]
The haters say I ain't shit
Hope I fall, but I can't slip
Got to ball, got to bank chips
Old ladies hate my moms cause their kids ain't amount to nothing
Catch my moms on the bench fronting
I got to stay awake, got to pray today
Glad I'm still alive, fuck what them haters say
So many times I ain't wanna rhyme
Wanted a normal life where I ain't Nas all the time
So many problems too, do what I got to do
As long as my moms say, "Boy, I'm proud of you"
I keep laying hits, winners never quits
Plus if I stop, how would I stay legit?

[Chorus: Nas]
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby



[Intro]
Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world
It's a new world, it's a new world
Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world

[Verse 1]
Yo, celebrate the new life
New ways to make money
New ways to break dummies
Forge they name and take money
Computers ain't that smart
Whatever man built could be taken apart
Anything new can get old
Like dudes started rockin' platinum, some stopped wearin' gold
Solar-energized rides, no steerin' wheel, tell it how to drive
No propellers in the sky
Airplanes like many rockets
Waitin lists for the rich to get tickets to visit Mars
While the poor people starve, computers takin' over they jobs
A man's forced to live off land
Now it's back to the caveman era
When we made fire, by two sticks rubbin' together
The truth is, many are too scared of new data
America Online, cut off, see you later

[Chorus]
Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin'
A new way to play, a new way a livin'
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin'
New life for man, children, and women
Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin'
A new way to play, a new way a livin'
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin'
New life for man, children, and women

[Verse 2]
Yo, the new Mike Tyson's Roy Jones
Bill Clinton's the new JFK, without the hole in his dome
The new Don Trump is Bill Gates
Not because his occupation, it's 'cause we respect his cake
And cake mean his stock, net gross
Young kids step it up, go for the most
New cameras in police cars takin' pictures
New hustlas gettin' new street figures
And US embassies overseas
Almost every foreign country's under siege
Covertly startin' wars, CIA, NAVY Seals
Commit larcenies that be worth over mil's
Oil in the earth spills
Girls blow they body up, birth control pills
African's pick diamonds out a dark caves
Then we wear it on our necks just so we can light up the stage

[Chorus]
Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin'
A new way to play, a new way a livin'
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin'
New life for man, children, and women

[Verse 3]
Say goodbye to the brainwashed
Say goodbye to the young kids who not smart
Say goodbye to the toasters and Pop-Tarts
Yo, it's real
Swallow a little pill, there's a four-course meal
Say hello to the one world
Say hello to the sky, something's out there watchin' you and I
More enticin' than Star Trek, StarTAC phones
Your genes and DNA is used to make clones
You got CD-Rom, everything operates by computers
Then what happens when circuit breaks?
Y2K's the big scare
Scientists say we ain't prepared
What I feel is contrare
Alexander Graham Bell made telephones, yes
But now we request for your e-mail address
I might be old fashioned, stuck in my ways
But nothin' make me more happier than seein' today

[Chorus]
Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin'
A new way to play, a new way a livin'
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin'
New life for man, children, and women



[Chorus]
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, still we choose to ignore
The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master
What you looking for? You the question and the answer

[Verse 1]
We trust no black leaders, use the stove to heat us
Powdered eggs and government cheeses
The calendars with Martin, JFK and Jesus
Gotta be fresh to go to school with fly sneakers
Schools with outdated books, we are the forgotten
Summers, cooling off by the fire hydrant
Yeah I'm from the ghetto
Where old black women talk about their sugar level
It's not unusual
To see photos of dead homies funerals
Aluminum foil on TV antennas
Little TV sit on top the big TV, eating TV dinners
Girls dye their hair with Kool-Aid
They gave us lemons, we made lemonade
But this nigga's paid, ancestry of slaves
Descendant of kings, it's necessary I - bling
Put rims on everything, wear Timbs on every scene

[Chorus]
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, still we choose to ignore
The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master
What you looking for? You the question and the answer

[Verse 2]
Do I mean it like a slave master, nigga?
No I'm gangsta, gotta eat rappers
My abbreviation was young when I caught the cases
That should mean the court could see my changes
Take off the bracelets
Savage when broke, smoke sour diesel, need no Bowflex
My chest still cut up like a bag of dope
Thought patterns consist of boss matters
Spit Moses' lost commandments like a gross sandwich out my mouth
Toast to government cameras peeping us, every week I must
Have my cars, homes and phones squeaked for bugs
But this is what I was dreaming of
Between cutting hard coke with new razors slicing my fingers up
They used to string us up, we wanted everything
But the one bringing us cake be the snakes like the
Like the New Jack City wedding scene
No time for mistakes, trying to get it like Medellin

[Chorus]
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, still we choose to ignore
The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master
What you looking for? You the question and the answer

[Verse 3]
My nig', what up my nig'? Yep!
People afraid of criticism
But I always put myself in a sacrificial position
They been know I ain't just rapping for fame
I got my old homie's half-sister father asking for chains
Yep, I give the cash up, this paper don't matter
They see me from skinny to fatter, when I rap about war
They got a tendency to scatter, they ain't my backup no more
So now my enemies are at my front door
'Cause anytime we mention our condition, our history or existence
They calling it reverse racism
Still to this day the streets torn - my brother Jung'
I'll always have a seat for him - not behind me, beside me
You'll always know where to find me
They say the close ones will hurt you
So let's keep a small circle
On the road to riches and diamond rings
In the land of the blind, the man with one eye is the king

[Chorus]
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, still we choose to ignore
The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master
What you looking for? You the question and the answer



[Verse 1]
I'm oblivious to you skeptics
What you hear you ain't ever hear 'til I repped it
Iridescent heroes essence, please clear the exits
I chase demons outdoors, force 'em to hear the message, air 'em out
Heard some people discussing my whereabouts
Yeah, it's been a few sightings of me, a fair amount
Never seen much, but yet I'm never in the house
Move in style, wild, exciting when I do step out
Y'all been rhyming for years and Jungle made a hit
"Oochie Wally" I did
Sold a million records
Had 'em embarrassed
Signed to Columbia
Blew a check, he was laughing
While y'all in the studio bragging about your past and
Thinking back on trips on Manhattan
Dad was rolling hotels like The Plaza
Black bellhops holding
Rich people bags, tip their hats to old men coming out of cabs
Limousine holding doors for them
We all got a job to do, go for it

[Chorus]
No bad energy, please, no bad energy
(Just try to be the best you, man
That's all I can say, man)
No bad energy, please, no bad energy
(Don't light over here, man
Put that away, man, put that away)
No bad energy, please, no bad energy
(Tryna tell 'em, know what I'm saying?
Big Apple my Hennessy, please)
No bad energy, please, no bad energy
(On the rocks, yeah)

[Verse 2]
To rappers who never sold crack, telling other people's lives
Never shot nobody but be shooting people in their rhymes
Never robbed nobody or re-upped with coke in they ride
I'm probably who they talking about when they're writing most of their lines
And I ain't notice it
Trapping was what was happening with bolder cliques
Around me I'm surrounded by the most devoted clique
We saw the smokers get rowdy for all the potentness
And still ain't know how sick it was in that ocean abyss
What doesn't come out in the wash comes out in the rinse
You suckers ain't had no say so
Whoever put you in the position to have a say so should be questioned theyself
I'm silk shirts, summer time sunny, sun chaser
Pretty girl tongue taster, southern girl luster
City girl love maker
The matinee watcher
The good weather on a Saturday afternoon shopper
Good gift copper
Still miss Big Poppa

[Chorus]
No bad energy, please, no bad energy
No bad energy, please, no bad energy
No bad energy, please, no bad energy
No bad energy, please, no bad energy



[Intro]
Uhh, uhh
Uhhh, uhhh, uhhh

[Chorus]
No idea's original, there's nothing new under the sun
It's never what you do, but how it's done
What you base your happiness around? Material, women, and large paper
That means you inferior, not major
No idea's original, there's nothing new under the sun
It's never what you do, but how it's done
What you base your happiness around? Material, women, and large paper
That means you inferior, not major

[Verse]
If niggas could look inside my mind, you'll find
Where bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes
Go to the center, enter with caution, past the brain cell graveyard
Where weed's responsible for memory loss
Let's witness, the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous
See what I seen every day I live with this torture
Lightin' spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours
Sleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower
My tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons
Long as I'm still breathin' I'm still winnin', I'll teach 'em
The hood converted from trey bags to 20's a girl
Everybody had money, every summer was real ill
Four-finger rings, dope dealers, 'caine/Kane
No Half Steppin' with flat tops when Rakim reigned
Radios on card tables, Benetton, the Gods buildin'
Ask for today's mathematics, we Allah's children
And this was goin' on in every New York ghetto
Kids listened, Five Percenters said it's pork in Jell-o
We coincide, we in the same life, maybe a time difference
On a different coast, but we share the same sunlight
You're part of the world, might be like colors and gangs
While on my side, brothers'll murder for different things
But it all revolve around drugs, fame and shorties
Stuck for your bling, stripped for your chain, the same story
From, Czechoslovakia to Texas metropolis
Them treacherous rastas in the Mexican mafias
Be scrappin' with tats on they back, violent wars
Nothin' less than a lethal injection if ever caught
Courtrooms, eagles and flags, American style
While in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul
Watchin' for paint chips, don't want no lead in yo' child
But them gangstas put lead in yo' child, the bezzy be out
The chain be like a hundred K
Shinin' since Roxanne Shante' made Runaway; that's been a minute
Genesis is deep, my features are that of a God
It's not a facade it's a fact, these rappers wanna be Nas
My Exodus doesn't exist, I'll never leave the streets, it's all in my mind
Even with sleep I'm duckin' nines in my dreams
Si-rens, wide awake, why'd I think it would change
Can't hide when you famous or even try to do the same things
Like, somebody's always watchin'
My life before I, walk out the door I size up every option
Eyes cut every direction, it's like God or guns
Which is better protection? Can't decide, that's a hard one
I mean they wanna see me in prison, the chains bamboozled
Headline readin' "Rapper Slain From a Man Shootin'"

[Intro]
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

[Verse 1]
PS 111 had free lunch
Embarrassed but managed to get a plate...
We was kids hungry
Mom's working, I was famished
She getting home late...
So I decided now I'm in charge
Either stay full or starve
Corner store like "Mister, spare-a-quarter"
Before Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars
Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard
Roll with a shooting squad
How could I not succumb? How could I not partake?
Fifteen, I got a gun
Sixteen, I robbed a train
Licked off a shot for fun
What's got inside my brain?
A hustler's job ain't done, til he becomes a king
But I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the midst of
Dudes who switch up and change
They wanna carry me like I'm some kind of lame
I never let them though, I just forgive them though
Either that or the pistol blow

[Break: sample]
"Say YEAH! Haha, thank ya! Ahhh, Hallelujah!
Y'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!"

[Verse 2]
I remember early mornings, syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah
Walking up the dark stairwells, elevators was out of order, yeah
Worth two hundred million now
Bicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums
Brazilian women on Xannies they pulling off panties
I'm pushing forty, she only twenty-one
Don't applaud me, I'm exhausted G
Me and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup
Y'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut
Remember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck
Said stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani
Hood forever, I just act like I'm civilized
Really what's in my mind is organizing a billion Black motherfuckers
To take over J.P. and Morgan, Goldman and Sachs
And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back

[Break: sample]
"Say YEAH! Haha, thank ya! Ahhh, Hallelujah!
Y'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!"

[Verse 3]
1990's Polo Ralph Lauren on him
Gone a few years, the whole world snoring on him
Girls all up on him
I spread em, hit 'em and dead 'em
She says, third leg from a legend is sheer heaven
She says, it is the greatest loving
The tales you hear is the truth on me
Who wasn't the most faithful husband
Reveal my life, you will forgive me
You will love me, hate me, judge me, relate to me
Only a few will, this how it sounds when you're too real
They think it's just music still
Well I am a graphic classic song composer
Music notes on sheets, I wrote this piece to get closure
Some of y'all might know Kelis
This goes to her with love, also goes to y'all, let's see
The craziest things already happened to me
So either you'll be laughing at me or you're laughing with me, ha

[Break: sample]
"Say YEAH! Haha, thank ya! Ahhh, Hallelujah!
Y'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!"



[Intro: Nas & Maxwell]
*Oooooooooooh!*
Maxwell go and sing
*Ooohh, this for the ladies*
M-A-X
*Doin' it*
N-A-S
*I'm back again (who's back)
Again, again, I'm back again (who's back)
Ooh, tell me (who's back)
I'm back again (who's back)
Again, again, I'm back again*

[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah the booty is the bass
The highs, the beauty in ya eyes
First glance I became alive
She went through a lot of dangerous guys, surprise
Now she would decide on Nas
Cause I ain't choose her, she chose me
In the party, it was a early day a March
When I first had ya legs arched
In the park, wasn't even dark
We was in the zone, we ain't care who watch
Baby was the wine though the trees was sparked
She said till you get enough, please don't stop
So I played wit it, got the moist spot hot
If I ain't hittin' the bottom, I'm getting some top
My hair cut look air brushed
Whatever I wear is straight plush from the ears to chucks
As we sashayed across the dance floor
Just, me and you no one else but us two

[Hook: Maxwell]
No other girl in the room
No other girl in the room but you
(There's no other girl lookin' as good as you)
There's nobody but you
(They can try, they can try)
No other girl in the room
(But you know, you know, you know)
No other girl in the room
(Oh, oh, ooo ooo)
No other girl in the room but you
(There's no other girl, no)
There's nobody but you
(They try)
No other girl in the room
(There's nobody to,)

[Verse 2]
In the early eighties, shorty had me off the wall
A super freak as my thoughts revolved
It's like a menage Winona Gaye and Leila Hathaway
Both they fathers a tell me to play, sip Jose
On our honeymoon everyday
We dance to the same tune everyday
Beauty and the goon they would say
You promise, savage beast
You a sexy freak
Your moist lips negates the ecstacy
Number one in my book, no discrepancy
When you walk on the earth, you be reppin' me
I'm obsessed with thee, cherish every breath you breathe
No matter what's going on around us
All I could hear was the sound of (her)
Twirlin' her around just (her)
See nobody in the crowd just (her)

[Hook: Maxwell]
(No other)
No other girl in the room
(No one)
No other girl in the room but you
(There's no other girl)
There's nobody but you
(Thinkin' about you baby, baby)
No other girl in the room
(Never ever, ever, ever, see you)
No other girl in the room
(Oh)
No other girl in the room but you
(No other girl has, they're not you)
There's nobody but you
(Oooh baby yeah)
No other girl in the room

[Bridge: Nas]
Uh, horns!
Clap
Everybody clap
C'mon, clap
Max mellow 'em out

[Maxwell]
Oh it's just my, it's just my, it's just my girl
Oh, it's just, just my, just my baby, you
Just you, just me, no one else but you
No one, no one, just me and you, oh babe

[Nas]
Clap! Break it down

[Olu Dara]
You know it all comes from Africa
But my version is the blues



[Intro: Nas & Puff Daddy]
Escobar season begins
Ayo, we ain't posin' for no pictures in 2018
Candid shit only
Scared motherfuckers

[Verse 1: Nas & Puff Daddy]
Black Kemet gods (yeah), black Egyptian gods (let's go)
Summoned from heaven, blessed, dressed in only Goyard
Homie go hard like Stone and Robert in a stolen car
Shoot the ballot box, no voter card, they all are frauds
Senegal's finest, minerals, diamonds
The Earth is cursed but I survive many climates
Calm and thoroughly, they try to Hyman Roth me
John Fitzgerald me, the industry never bought me
(You know God sent me here)
Fear will make you reveal who you really are
Feel me God? Be solid, your foes hold you in ill regard
This ain't knowledge, this is not intense
For honored men, women too
Us who can see the same thing, but have a different view (let's go)
All of a sudden, frontin' niggas knew you from your past
Got all kinds of guys sayin' we go way back
And who y'all comparin' me to is nonsense
Show gratitude in the presence of dominance

[Chorus: 070 Shake & Nas]
I think they scared of us, yeah
I think they scared of us
I think they scared of us, yeah
I think they scared
To Catholics

[Verse 2: Nas & Puff Daddy]
To Catholics, Moors and Masons (motherfuckers!)
John Hanson was not the first black pres to make it
Abe Lincoln did not free the enslaved
Progress was made 'cause we forced the proclamation
(Fuck your proclamation!)
SWAT was created to stop the Panthers
Glocks were created for murder enhancement
For hunting men, circumstances
Edgar Hoover was black
Willie Lynch is a myth, Colombians created crack
The government made stacks (welcome to America, niggas!)
Reagan had Alzheimer's, that's true
Fox News was started by a black dude, also true (fuck you too!)
Convinced my experiences were meant to be
Helps me navigate as they validate they treachery
Felt established, fake as he smile, handshake questionable
"Am I good?" he ask, thinkin', "But is he testin' you?"
(Is he testin' you?) In my hood, fear does a few things
Make you pussy, make you a snitch
Make irrational moves or even turn you to food

[Chorus: 070 Shake & Puff Daddy]
I think they're scared of us, yeah
I think they're scared of us
I think they're scared of us, yeah
I think they scared
I think they scared of us, yeah
I think they scared of us
See, we don't care about what you think about us
I think they scared of us, yeah
What you say about us
I think they scared
You bitch ass, yeah

[Outro: Puff Daddy]
Ayo, that's why they be killing us and shooting us
That's why they feel uncomfortable around us
'Cause of our greatness
You're lucky God made us compassionate
And forgiving
Pssh, man, they scared of us, Nas
We see that bitch in your eyes



[Intro: Nas and Kelis]
What nigga! What bitch-ass niggas! What!
Babe, babe, start the car!
(Nasir, come on, let's go!
Get in the car now, let's go! Throw it out, let's go!
Aight, aight, aight, yeah
But I got 'em. But I got 'em, though
(This is crazy, why didn't you just throw it out of the car?
This is so stupid, what are you doing?
Why are we even out here?
Why are we out here? What's going on?
This is retarded, yo, we gotta
This is crazy. Never again
You'd throw everything away, for what?

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yeah, my man Kool G Rap told me, "Son, do not look back"
Chill up in the mansion with a fat glutious max, relax
When people act schoolin' with facts, tell 'em
At this point in my life I'm all about chillin'
Ridin' around in something sick and the dress flies
And twist, homie's hermano just died, I gotta let it ride
That's what I got the public thinkin', my nigga
Just cause I ain't in the hood don't mean shit, my nigga
I know who died before the body dropped
I know the guns that were used
How much money the shooter got
Cause on the private yacht I'm still within earshot of it all
The top ten list of the most grimiest guys of all time
Is all we talk when we talk in New York, y'all
Who to call and who to stay away from
Whose mother's address to have just to play it safe, son
Women they lust up so quick to give 'em up
What cars and what trucks they drive in
What towns they spend the most time in when they grindin'
I found out most of them are cowards
They hidin' behind reputations that's sour; I'm not going back

[Hook: Kelis and Nas]
The streets keep tryin' to say
Come back around this way
I've already gone that way
I won't go back today
I'm not going back!
X2

[Verse 2: Nas]
First thing that happen when you make a little paper
You think the Marriot is livin' in a skyscraper
Till you come across some ever more flyer paper
Realize that five-star tellies are even greater
Terry-cloth robes, elegance, movie shit
Heated-up marble floors with jacuzzis in it
First-class flights, diamonds in your crucifixes
All those things, you still ain't really doing shit, kid
Cause in reality, I'll earn my salary
The way I flaunted it then would now embarrass me
It kinda make me wanna hate bling
It's a race thing how they sell blacks to bootleg shit
In fact, real millionaires spend 60 mil on paintings
Whores charge niggas with raping
Cause we come out doors of Maybach cars
Watch us make bets on race tracks, smokin' cigars
So they counter the laws to take what's ours
'Bout 500K on a lawyer to beat the charge
So you can't stop us from making a billion dollars
Instead of going back, I'm buying the projects
But I'm not going back
The hood's in me forever y'all, but I'm not going back

[Hook]

[Outro: Nas]
And of course y'all know what I'm not going back to
Those no friends of mine (And I'm not going back to)
Ten carat gold, it shine (And I'm never going back to)
Sony, if they don't have dough to sign
(Not going back to)
Y'all know that I'm not going back to
Those liars who would (Not going back to)
Not help you if they could (Not going back to)
Coke on the stove in the hood
Y'all should know that I'm not going back
The hood's in me forever y'all, but I'm not going back

[Hook]



[Intro]
A lot of times it seems like, you ain't gon' make it where you wanna be in life
But, yo if you got a plan, believe me you gon' get there
You gon' get everything you ever wanted baby
That's my word

[Verse 1]
Trust, my niggas come home from long bids
They check for me before they see their own kids
I open up accounts for 'em, we bounce tourin'
Major cities, arenas, headline with big time singers
Cop Ferraris with navigational screens
Guide us through your hood and any locality, head back to Queens
Piped out seats, Oakwood MB cord speakers
Bumpin' out old shit
That made me think of Old Easters '86 in a Le Tigre short sleeves
Lees, flip the cuffs up, gettin' fucked up
From Old E, Fresh Fest, niggas got hurt
100 niggas rush the door with Queensbridge tournament shirts
Back then, nobody wore a vest
Pull out razors, you had to put your hand skills to the test
Get your Pumas took, come home barefoot willin'
Look at the chain, I snatched with a medallion worth a thousand
Cops rushed the garden made it home smilin'
Half of the crew probably on the island
Project call play puff ball the hoop was made out of a hanger
Playin' corners stick the elevator never thought
Project life was promised nothin' but to die trife
For steppin' on the next man's Nikes, my motto look for tomorrow
Today is yesterday look at the hood now, I'm mad that it turned out that way
Gats spray these shorties is killers
The older G's taught us well, what's wild now is that they're smaller
And they look at me like I'm on the outside lookin' in
Like 'who's you' when I cruise through
I call shorty took him in watch your friends, get ends
Be clever, realize that today's the first day that begins forever

[Chorus]
Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it?
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it?
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever

[Verse 2]
Nice cars, livin' like a star club hoppin'
Poppin' bottles at the bar love shoppin'
Gucci, Iceberg, coppin' two, three nice furs
One for your wife, one for your freak silver spurs
Rolls Royce too good to be true, houses worth 2.2
Pool parties beautiful view
You made it in life, Forbes Magazine style baggy jeans style
Pass the green while hoes wit' meanwhile
Asses, pretty mommies illest bodies pass glasses
Louis Roderra with Peach Schnapps you just relaxin'
Thinkin', "Damn, wish my niggas could afford this"
On the sand at your Malibu house holdin' a cordless
Talkin' to lawyers accountants investments
Money doubles, triples protected hard work you manifested
Worries of failure, when you buried with your familia
Keep your name prosperin' to the maximum
You should live, there's only one life that's the physical
Rich or poor in jail why the fuck should you be miserable
Things happen for reasons, the clock keeps tickin'
Love could have your heart beat skippin', thugs turn to religion
The bitch you love could start to hate you
The shit you use to do escape you
Things that make you laugh represent the past
Reminisce the block gamble gees on the floor
Niggas use to be the man, you don't see 'em no more
Your favorite restaurants and favorite stores, they tore 'em down
Turned 'em into shopping malls the hood is like a ghost town
Haunted by souls who thought that time stood still
Just live your life to the fullest, never look back, it's real

[Chorus]
Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it?
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it?
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever

[Outro]
Ya know, ya know, nothin' lasts forever ya know
Let it go, let it go

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Blackit's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
It's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeahstraight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yonow;

[Verse 1]
Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition, of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up in street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers "Back up!"  the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, "Yo, my shit is stuck!"
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back
And saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' through the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?)
It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
And black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she got to smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in the New York State of Mind

[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

[Verse 2]
Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Mots, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'mma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind

[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

[Outro: Sample]
"Nasty Nas"



[Spoken: Nas]
Twenty years in the making
What was I thinking?
1992, wow
I wasn't sure how to get into the rap game
The incredible rap game
It's all a dream
It's time, and when that time came
I took it
Yeah

[Verse 1: Nas]
Rappers, I monkey flip 'em, with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up in street clothes
Hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at baseheads tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass and

Yeah, yeah
Detonize, come on
Detonize what
Detonize all

[Spoken: Nas]
Thank you
20 years ago, I was writing that rhyme in a small apartment, in a small room, inside that small apartment. Just living in a world that I knew, talking about the things that I see and live man. You know, teenagers' mind is wild



[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Intro]
Uhh.. yo
Whattup? Whattup?
It's time man (word, it's time?)
Straight up (it's time, man)
Aight, set that shit off (set it off then, nigga)
Set it off (set if off)

[Verse 1]
Broken glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors
Neighbors look at every bag you bring through your doors
Lock the top lock, momma should've cuffed me to the radiator
Why not? It might've saved me later from my block
N.Y. cops, hookers crawlin' off the stroll, coughin'
Stitches in they head, stinkin' and I dread thinkin' they be snitchin'
But who else, could it be, shook at these, unmarked vans
Parked in the darkNARC's, where's your heart?
Hustlers starvethey bust a U-ey, I jog
To my buildingcome out later wearin' camouflage
See the sergeant and the captainstrangle men
Niggas gaspin' for air 'til they move no more and just stare
With dead eyestired of riots, shit is quiet
Simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews
Overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sisters pregnant
Fathers on drugs, moms is smokin', beds is piss-infested
Had 8 partners growin' up, 8 turned to 7
7 turned to 6 niggas, got 2 in heaven
6 of us holdin' it, now it's 5 rollin' thick
The 6th one's parole flipped, 5 niggas went to 4 quick
When he went O.T., college life
Converted into gangbangin', 4 niggas still hangin'
Years passin' and slang changin'3 of us now, 4th nigga ain't around
We all thought he was realhe did the snake shit
Fake shitbeat his ass down
Yo his mouth could've got us all wasted, what a fuckin' clown
All I got left in the end is 2 of my best friends
And we all goin' out to the death for these ends
What?

[Chorus (repeats in bridge)]
New York, New York (New York state of mind)
New York, New York (New York state of mind)

[Bridge]
You heard about it, you see about it
You read about it, it's in your papers
It's in your daily news ("Get money!")
New York chronicles, every day
The crime rate, the murder rate
The money rate, the paper chase (aight?)
You know what I mean?
New York state of mind, baby (oh, yeah)
Check it out (yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'm at the gamblin' spot, my hands on a knot
New York Yankee cap cover my eyes, stand in one spot
I take a nigga dough, send him home to a shoebox
You lost that nigga I put your dollar in the jukebox
Hear my favorite song, all these niggas sing along
All the cigarette smoke's cloggin' my lungs
Hoodrats flashin' they tongue
Young thugs blastin' they gun, we got reputations
Bitches and niggas both on parole or probation
Shit is sick, niggas got gats, army fatigues
I got my eyes glued on whoever walk in or leave
'Cause I ain't playin', niggas'll run up in here and shoot up this shit
Stick yo' ass up, niggas'll find the loot in your kicks
Bunch of triple-cross niggas, just New York niggas
Lift you off your feet when they was just talkin' with you
Some of these dudes the Feds be on 'em, you knew 'em for years
Be the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers
That ain't gangsta, niggas is up North with tatted tears
Your name's on the affadavit, you ratted kid
Faggot-ass niggas that be scared to do they bids
Fuck you, we run you out of N.Y, you can't live
Got your quiet niggas, that relocated down South
Comin' back to floss, then you got the jealous loudmouths
All of a sudden we got Crips and Bloods, D.T.'s
Runnin' round quick to split your mug, it's easy
To score but it's hard to get the shit off
Niggas fightin' over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off
When the fiend come around the block, happy as hell
Niggas mad 'cause they ain't get a piece of that sale
Cutthroat connivers, universal, ghetto survivors
Go to any hood that's live and make it liver
A lot of niggas schemin', some real, some niggas frontin'
But I'm a big dreamer, so watch me come up with somethin'

[Chorus]
New York, New York
New York, New York



[Intro: Nas + Alicia Keys]
Nasty ("Yeah, yeah")
(New York, New York, New York, New York)
Ayo, Black, it's timeagain! ("Yeah, yeah")
(New York, New York, New York, New York)
YeahPremier! ("Yeah, yeah")
(New York, New York, New York, New York)
("Ayo, Black, it's time")

[Verse 1: Nas]
If you knew my streets
you would know, all everybody talk about is who got beef
Who's snitchin', who told police
Who came home, who's still gone, who rest in peace
Now they killin' over music-money, not drugsrap replaced it
'Cause thugs with no brains got no patience
New jacksI pistol whip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Saddam Hussein
still alive, lookin' at his dead children's burnt remains
I birthed the game, learned you lames a new lesson
Your crew's soft, man, y'all need some new weapons
The Ps breed warriors in skullies and Timbies
Around micks, spics, niggas, and guineas
From my ghetto kings in deep thought, we don't blink
But don't think we wastin' our time
It's a New York state of mind

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
New York, New York, New York, New York City, whoah ohh
New York, New York, New York, New York City, gritty

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
It's like a jungle out here
So much struggle out here
And my dreams steal my rest
Sleep's the cousin of death
Always feels like a race against father time
In the Streets of New York
(New York state of mind, New York state of mind)
All I see is street hoes
And bullet holes in our people
Only crime fills the brain
Feels like I'm goin' insane
The revolution has to start, don't waste no time
In the Street of New York
(New York state of mind)
New York state of mind
(New York state of mind)
C'mon

[Altered Chorus: Alicia Keys]
New York, New York, New York, New York ohh
State of mind (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York ohh
State of crime (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York ohh
Big dreams (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York ohh
Big schemes

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
Oh, it's like the game
Just ain't the same
Baby thugs and girls
With no shame
Can't get away (get away)
Epidemic plague (plague)
Every hood in every state
Don't have no reasons cause believing's hard to find
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)

[Verse 3: Rakim]
I'm from the home of a million legends and trend settin'
A lot of footsteps to follow, I been steppin'
Mind stressin'tryna find direction, crime spreadin'
Time precious, I ain't have rest since 9/11
I live fast, hustle like today is my last
I get cash, the struggle's like a day on the Ave
Crack, D and raw, gats squeezin' off
Manhattan streets in awe from casualties of war
The eve of the Apocalypse, evil people in politics
Every block is at risk, the metropolitan metropolis
The opposite of Liza Minnelli and Frank Sinatra
Alicia Keys, Nas and, Ra; the gangsta's opera
So, New York Citywalk with me, talk gritty
It's up to us, New York, it's our city
Here the man come with the anthemhands up
It's time, the thrill is back New York, so stand up

[Chorus + Outro/Coda: Alicia Keys + Rakim]
New York, New York, New York, New York City, whoa ohh
(Uh. Yeah.)
New York, New York, New York, New York City, gritty
(Crucial Keys. Ya God, Rakim Allah)
New York, New York, New York, New York City, whoa ohh
(New York City. Nasty Nas)
New York, New York, New York, New York City, gritty
(A. Keys. Yeah, c'mon)

Its ny state of mind



[Produced by Q-Tip]

[Verse 1: Nas]
What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, "Yeah," shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged, plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
(One what?) One love!

[Hook: Q-Tip]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Verse 2: Nas]
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together  what up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love

[Hook: Q-Tip]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Verse 3: Nas]
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin'
"How can we exist through the facts?"
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together: in the Bridge we call 'em oo-wops
He said: "Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce."
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
Cause when the pistol blows
The one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only 12, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love

[Hook: Q-Tip]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Outro: Nas]
To all my niggas locked up
From Queensbridge and all over
To my man [Goon?], one love
To my man Herb, one love
To my man [Lake Gucciano?], one love
Can't forget my motherfuckin' heart, Big [Bo?], one love
To [Oogie?], yeah, one love



[Verse 1]
What up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid

But maintain when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your ma duke's loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwilding in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home he'll play it low key
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies, I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs but one love

[Hook: Q-Tip]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects, I take my pen and pad
For the weekend hittin L's while I'm sleeping
A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home
You see the streets had me stressed something terrible
Fucking with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from 8 to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rolling two phillies together in the Bridge we called 'em oo-wops
He said "Nas, niggas caught me busting off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black trey-deuce"
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughing, one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chilling on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talking mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
Cause when the pistol blows the one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'm ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love

[Hook: Q-Tip]

[Outro:]
Oh, One Love, means keepin' it real
For the brothers that's locked down
Keep that one love
For the brothers out in the East
Keep that one love
For all the brothers uptown
Keep that one love
For all the brothers in jail
Keep that one love
One love means keepin' it real
One Love, One Love
One love means keepin' it real



[Intro: Nas]
Damn

[Verse 1: Nas]
What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, "Yeah," your girl don't care, she a snake too
Messin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged, plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
Is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my dawg when push came to shove
(One what?) One love!

[Chorus: Nas]
One love, one love, one love
We should write letters to one another
Now they email you from jail, right?
Yeah, one love, one love, one love, one love
Yeah, one love, one love, one love, one love

[Verse 2: Nas]
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together  what up, son?
Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a
But I heard you blew a dude with a...for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab dudes know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home he'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs

[Chorus: Nas]
One love, one love, one love, one love
We keep it 100
One love, one love, one love, one love
Yeah, one love, one love, one love, one love
Here's the summary, for the whole shit

[Verse 3: Nas]
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin'
"How can we exist through the facts?"
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects

He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak

Cause when the pistol blows
The one that's murdered be the
Tough luck when niggas are..., families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose

One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
Real shit
"Represent"
"Represent"

Lot of dudes I wrote about on that album have passed on
And that's [?] specifically
Damn, my man George
Marty, Yammie
There so many of them

[Intro]
One time, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop, glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot backfuck gettin' hit!
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon
Sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with 9s out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now!

[Chorus]
Yo, all I need is one mic
All I need is one mic (that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (all I need, niggas)
All I need is one mic (yeah)

[Verse 2]
All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen
One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter of fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against mefuck all of them!
Jesus died at age 33, there's 33 shots
From twin Glocks, there's 16 apiece, that's 32
Which means one of my guns was holdin' 17
27 hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up, shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, too many 9s
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way: they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now!

[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (that's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (there's nothin' else in the world)
All I need is one mic (that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know)
All I need is one mic (this is all I need)

[Verse 3]
All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is
Niggas'll move on you only if they know what your weakness is
I have none, too late to grab guns
I'm blastin' cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed
Body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range
Niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true
She came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace
Lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now

[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
All I need is one mic (all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)
All I need is one mic (fuck the cars, the jewelry)
All I need is one mic (to spread my voice to the whole world, baby)



[Verse]
Yo, all I need is one mic one beat one stage
One person front face onthefront page
Only ifI had one gun, one girland one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151 one sip probably'll make me flip

{*speaking softly, gradually getting louder*}

Turn my headphones up, it's pure
Nuttin' gonna stop me now, Stillmatic
Tye Fyfe remix, you know?
(I'm here now, we here, it's your world)
Ill Will y'all

Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One person front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one love, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with
151, one sip'll probably make me flip
See my name in the hieroglyphs, like Osiris and Isis
Parables written inside papyruses
Ackowledge it, we been all tricked time to come out of it
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us {*siren*} roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up
But my luck, I got up, the cop (shot) again
Bus stop, glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken
Richochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I duck back, forget gettin' hit! {*more sirens*}
This is my hood I'mma rep, to the death of it
'til everybody come home, little brothers is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb, we need more warriors soon
Sent from the star sun and the moon
In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
IF YOU REALLY THINK YOU READY TO FLY, WITH MIND POWER
THIS IS WHAT NAS IS 'BOUT, BROTHERS THE TIME IS NOW!

{*whispering again*}
Yo, all I need is one mic..
All I need is one mic.. that's all I need
All I need is one mic.. all I need
All I need is one mic.. yeah

{*gradually getting louder*}
All I need is one cup, one page, and one pen
One prayer - tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter fact maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me, touch alla them
Jesus died at age 33, there's thirty-three (shots)
From twin (Glocks) there's sixteen a piece, that's thirty-two
Which means, one of my dunns was holdin 17
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral
Never get caught up, pain'll go through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, brothers roll up, (shootin') from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this all slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of (macs), too many (nines)
If y'all people really wit me get busy load up the (semis)
Do more than just hold it explode the (clip) until you empty
There's nothin' in our way - they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
(Lead) flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
THAT WE TAKE THESE DUDES TO WAR, LIE 'EM DOWN
CAUSE WE STRONGER NOW MY PEOPLES THE TIME IS NOW!!

{*whispering again*}
All I need is one mic.. that's all I need, that's all I need
All I need is one mic.. there's nuttin' else in the world
All I need is one mic.. that's all a (nigga) need to do his thing y'know
All I need is one mic..

{*starting loud this time, getting quieter*}
ALL I NEED IS ONE LIFE, ONE TRY, ONE BREATH I'm ONE MAN
WHAT I STAND FOR SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
Or wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin all that slick stuff, while my name is biblical
Wonder what my secrets is, enemies'll move on you
Only if they know, what your weakness is I have none
Too late I'm mad young I'm laughin' cause I'm a cool brother
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you brothers
What you call a infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars, brothers knifin' each other
Up in prison yards, drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a, (cop) would get killed body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, people throwin dirt on my name
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
Women left me cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon cause none of these brothers real
Heard they were, tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track I'm finally found
You need some soul searchin', the time is now

All I need is one mic.. yeah, yeah yeah yeah
All I need is one mic.. that's all I ever needed in this world, (fuck) cash
All I need is one mic.. (fuck) the cars, the jewelry
All I need is one mic.. to spread my voice to the whole world



[NAS]
In my darkest days lighting up the rightous smoke
Cause I'm dealing with this thug life crisis and can't cope
Niggas on my dick beef don't stop
Niggas asking what happed to the Firm
Did you and AZ bone Fox? No
How was it working with Dre though?
Heard you was fucking Lil Kim and Mary J, Whoa , the list goes on
There is rumors that Brandy broke my heart
The world want to know what's in the life of the prettiest Don
Nas, was Jay fucking with your baby mom's?
Was she involved with a plot, to deceive my perfect degrees of
Three hundred and sixty, he ugly she pretty that's life
Never been married eloped with dope; Music's my wife
It's true, me and 2 PAC once steped to each other
Confronted our like's and dislike's in front of Suge Knight, we left it as brothers
As a child pop's blew his weed in my face, results, mixing ether with base
I'm the rebel to America, less is the nasal voice chipped tooth bastard
What your hearing is a replica
I never had a clue, that all you dudes should be in dresses
Double edges playing both sides of the fences

[Hook] [Nas & Lake]
Where my soul going to go when my ditch is dug?
One never knows do one
The things that I've seen in the streets I'm from
One never knows do one
The stuff that I've done what I've become
One never knows do one
Am I crazy what they make me out to be or what?
One never knows...

[LAKE]
The streets say what up wit Lake, not showin his face
And did he really shoot at the Jake's?
When he just came home, and dude shot at Capone, for his necklace
Why was Lake name mentioned?
Was he reppin on the island taking phone time?
Did he get Prodigy his chain back in "99"?
Who's writing his rhymes? He is
Do he be with Kingpin like Delson and Jesus, What was he thinking?
On Revolutionary Warfare when he said, He's a modern day Hitler
Did he shoot more niggas, Than every dude in QueensBridge?
Why his last case made the daily news in June?
Do he have the strength to unify heads from BX to Harlem?
Who did he stomp and walk naked in his Projects?
Did he get shot in his chest, never fall with no vest on shoot duke and walk off

[Hook]

[NAS]&[LAKE]
[N] A yo these niggas don't understand me
[N] There's going to be a murder my reason insanity
[N] The acts in the involvement with a homicide Nas
[N] Who did you shoot at the time when you could've got robbed?
[N] Do you call yourself a prophet of God?
[N] Did your hood set fire to your car in your project's in '95'?
[N] Did Jungle shoot up the club lately?
[N] Did Jungle kidnap Philly's Most Wanted, then they drove him to his safety?
[L] Yo, what happened to Puffy and Steve Stoute?
[L] Why did they scuffle with champane bottles smashing, what was it about?
[N] My video nailed to the cross
[N] Now Stoute started hating me, hanging with my enemies
[L] They ask everyday on my block
[L] How did I survive in ? by keeping it gangsta, why Nas
[L] Did you leave a clothes company after you made it millions?
[N] Cause Esco's weak I start a new line a ILL one

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
In the Rotten Apple, take a bite, taste the worm
Embrace the world of reality we're faced to learn
Coke connection drug bust, graveyards where thugs rest
I keep my mug blessed,the evil is illegal substance sold
Roll mob deep, guns in the black Jeep
MAC-11's in Legends, cracks in the streets
Patroller, gold money-folder, gun happy soldiers
Never sober, takin' over, my blood is colder
Niggas respect violence so I become it
I'm from it, I even done it blunted, so run it

[Interlude]
Yeah, son, you know what this is
Take it off, [come on, dunn
Don't even come at me like that]
[Dunn, come on, dunn]

[Chorus]
Yeah, imagine this: no guns, no knife
It's a one on one so now we gots to fight, son
Imagine this: no gun, no knife
It's a one on one, now we got to fight, yeah
Yeah, imagine that, no gun, no knife
It's a one on one, now we got to fight, yeah
Yeah, imagine this: no gun, no knife
It's a one on one, son

[Verse 2]
Yo, I'm a cream fiend with a mean dream
Brain full of schemes, my crew's rollin' fresh out the greens
Give you what you never seen, the infs on the MAC-10
It's 2:10 in the A.M. in the streets of Queens
Try hard and die hard
Chances of survivin' the game is like tryin' to feed Allah lard
I walk at piece with a deadly shadow
They want to blow me with the double barrel, foul, no sorrow
I brawl with Blanka, caught Bison in the thinker, dome
Make hell your new home, with the blue chrome
Mid-State wants me, suave fellow but raunchy
The soul of a cold body haunts me, I flee the country
But only to shed tears for years
Too wild for my own self, hopin' help is near
Street fightin' was cool, but in school I brought a new tool
Duelin' with the devil, a rebel, a fool

[Chorus]
Imagine this: no guns, no knife
Just a one on one so now we gots to fight, son
Imagine this: no gun, no knife
Just a one on one, now we got to fight, yeah
Imagine that, no gun, no knife
It's a one on one, now we got to fight, yeah
Imagine this: no gun, no knife
It's a one on one, son
Yeah, take it to the bridge  Queensbridge

[Interlude]
Yo, whassup money? [Yo yo, do you remember this face?]
[Yeah yeah yeah, run these, run these]
*sounds of brawl* [Break you down! Get broke!]
[No hands, run that, run that, run that, no hands]

[Verse 3]
I hear Jake walkie-talkies in my sleep
Marked money I keep, play the benches all week
I visualize Coups, alligators in suits
Elevators in my mansion that rises to the roof
Sippin' 80 proof, watchin' Juice, but hold up
I see some brothers tryin' to roll up, wishin' I could fold up
It's hard to see their faces in they hoodies, I better boogie
Too late, I tried to swing when they jigged me  I'm out

[Outro]
Yeah yeah, kid, don't front
360 degrees, knowhatI'msayin?
That's how it comes back at you
Queensbridge, that's how we live
South side, all that
New York, light it up, light it up
Yo yo, you saw how I snuffed that kid?
Yeah, I saw that, I saw that
Ain't no half  steppin' out here
That's how we do out here in the street fight!

[Chorus 1: Grand Wizard + Nas]
One time for your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time for your mind, one time
Yo, whatever
One time for your mind, one time
Hey yo, Nas? Kick that fuckin' rhyme!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Check it out, when I'm chilling, I grab the buddha
Get my crew to buy beers
And watch a flick, illin' and root for the villain, huh
Plus every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies
After being blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexin'
Keep lubrication, Lifestyle protection
Picking up my stereo's remote control quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck, rocking the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well a cappella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella
Go get your crew, Hobbes, I'm prepared to bomb troops
Y'all niggas was born, I shot my way out my mom dukes
When I was ten I was a hip-hoppin' shorty wop
Known for rocking microphones and twisting off a 40 top

[Chorus 2: Grand Wizard + Nas]
One time for your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time for your mind, one time
It sounds clever
Hey yo, Nas? Fuck that, man, that shit was phat
But kick that for them gangstas, man fuck all that!
Right, right

[Verse 2: Nas]
What up, niggas, how y'all? It's Nasty, the villain
I'm still writing rhymes, but besides that I'm chillin'
I'm tryin' to get this money, God
You know the hard times, kid
Shit, cold, be starving make you wanna do crimes kid
But I'ma lamp, cause a crime couldn't beat a rhyme
Niggas catching 3 to 9's, Muslims yelling "Free the mind"
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places
As a kid when I would say that out of town, niggas chased us
But now I know the time, got a older mind
Plus control a 9, fine, see now I represent mine
I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me
Yet I'm a menace, yo, police wanna murder me
Heini Dark drinker, represent the thinker
My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights, then inhale, it stimulates
Floating like I'm on the North 95 Interstate
Never plan to stop, when I write my hand is hot
And expand a lot from the Wiz to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make your heads bop, pa
I shine a light on perpetrators, like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job
My brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I've raided
I hold a MAC-11, and attack a reverend
I contact eleven L's and max in heaven

[Chorus 3: Grand Wizard + Nas]
One time for your mind, one time
It sounds clever
One time for your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time for your mind, one time
Yo, from '92 to '99

[Outro]
Yeah, that shit was crazy fat, pa
Know what Im sayin'?
But check it, you got another verse for me
I want you to kick it, you know what I'm sayin'?
Kick that shit for the projects



[Intro: Nas]
Slow it down

One time for your mind, one time

One time for your mind, one time
Yo, whatever
One time for your mind, one time
Yo, whatever
Hey one, check, check it out

[Verse 1: Nas]
When I'm chilling, I grab the buddha

After being blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexin'
Keep lubrication, Magnum protection
Hitting up my stereo's remote control quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck, rocking the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well a cappella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella
Go get your crew, Hobbes, I'm prepared to bomb troops
Rip in peace to my mom dukes
When I was ten I was a hip-hoppin' shorty wop
Known for rocking microphones and twisting off a 40 top

[Chorus: Nas]
One time for your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time for your mind, one time

[Sample]
On the real, all you crab niggas know the deal

[Intro]
Yeah, finally up in this nigga
Let's pay homage to Illmatic
Let's put the crown where it's at 10 years
Never been done this real by nobody

[Verse 1]
To my seed, may I lead you into no greed or evil
In the categories of stories I breed my sequel
You know the money, blues, blunts, broken 22's
Monkey see, monkey do, shorty sipping sunny dew
Now it's V.S.O.P. in a Phantom, mad smoky
Murder trees, cruising gat in the stash so it won't poke me
Up in the Trump Plaza, Suite 3010
Don't make no noise cause we dirty, tell 'em hoes hurry in
We got the room lit up with perfume and mad boom
And there's video taping blooming asses on the zooming lens
Rollin on you nondescript niggas, you're marked for death
Like Colombians with bad coke that gyp niggas
Tilt the dutch, twisted up the uwee if you're skilled enough
In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili busts

[Interlude]
That verse is ten years old, nine and half years old
Street's Disciple, the rebirth comin at you this year baby, it's on baby

[Verse 2]
To the hood, may this be the day that we pop them bottles
This is mandatory, what if there's not tomorrow?
You know the murder rate, jealousy, you heard 'em say
He say, she say, I'm 'bout cheddar, he don't deserve to make
Sipping clear liquor with niggas, that talk sideways
Listening close, to every word in case they violate
Up in the projects Apartment 5D
Spark a lea' it's 'bout the reed, counting everything the block see
We 'bout to need to take the corners from them cowards
Get it on so y'all can move more coke powder, by the hour
Hold in case we gotta rip niggas, loaded
Teflon coated projectiles'll flip niggas
From ninth grade to lightweight to grams to my mans with guns in hand
Police vans, they missed the summers again

[Verse 3]
Yeah, power to the people, death to the phonies
This beast to the mic one two check, y'all fed-e-rallies on me
And they look like you approachin me like how you, homie?
The F.B.I. see only one problem, they try to slump me
After the young black male cause he makes a lot of money
So hustlers make crack sales cause they deprived and hungry
My country hates that I could run free state to state with hunnies
While making cake with real golded plate rims on Humvees
The bush stroker, the kush smoker, nigga
Just when you thought it was over look over your shoulders
I'm 30 now, baby sip drinks and sip 'em slow
Motto no stress, smoking less than I did befo'
You see the kid was broke 'til I spitted vivid expressions
Of hard living ghetto children, of a lesser God
Religion was fast women, expensive cars
Y'all witnessin over 10 years, the best of Nas



[NAS]
Yea (House of Hits)
Finally up in this nigga
On the real, all you crab niggas know the deal
On the real, all you crab niggas know the deal
To my seed, May I lead you into no breed of evil
In the categories and stories I breed my sequel
You know the money, blues, blunts, broken 22's
Monkey see, Monkey do
A shorty sipping sunny dew
Now its V.S.O.P. in a G.S. thats mad smokey
Murder tree's, Crusin gun in the stash so it won't poke me
Up in the Marriot, Suite 3010
Don't make no noise cause we dirty, tell the hoes to hurry in
We got the room lit up with perfume, and mad boom
And there's video taping of booming ass's on the zooming lens
Rolling on you non descript niggas
Your marked for death like colombians with bad coke that gip niggas
Tilt the dutch, twisting up the uwee if your skilled enough
In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili's bust

Chorus
On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal
On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal 2x

[K-L from ScrewBall]
Now its verbal abuse cause the mic's in use
This is your sorry excuse
Get your neck put in a noose
K-L is quick to let loose, to make your blood count reduce
Over the snare drum
We reproduce like cum
Impregnating the track, making it fatter than it was
Giving life to idea
Through the verse is what he does

[Kamakazee a.k.a. KL]
See a close call about two clicks from my fortress
We rolling squad deep, on the Kawasaki hourses
QueensBridge got the drop on you niggas trying to toss us
We metal down now its time to show these clowns who the boss is
We live for the shit, Ain't trying to take no lossess
Accumalating to much cream for you to touch
Fucking welcome to my clutches, wipe the blood on off my chuckers
From the ruckus
Your gone and your crew still love us
Can't call it, I'm in love with this good life shit
I'm working with jewels, car, chicken clits, paying rent
Murdered Presidents, running wild, stacking in piles
Onyx pendants, and Rubied down shit from the nile
Kamikaze style, sought the antique three pound
Yo Nas, lets cop this brick and let the mobb supply the town

Chorus 2x

[Cormega]
(Play some treats on us)
Drugs in my shirtsleeve
The side bubble converti
Eyes low cause the lye blow
Five-oh know we dirty drive slow
Write a line sipping a glass of wine
The block is mine cause I am a live criminal mastermind
When I rhyme, I perfect this, niceness, I'm blessed with
Exhale precise shine like cocaine white
Its the life of Pablo, Escobar niggas I know
With diamond rolexes, that drive infinit's and lexus
So send my enemies a message
My Tommy Hilfiger vest, is bullet proof, so when niggas shoot
I'm still protected
So never ask why I write so violent
My brain storm formed on a dorm in Rikers Island
I remained calm while you tried to bite my style and
When I performed niggas mic's went silent
To the kid who made my man Ill Will's blood spill
(On the real)
When I catch up to your ass you know the deal

[Nas and Cormega]
On the real

Chorus 4x



[Verse 1]
I wouldn't marry a black woman here's the reason why
(Why)
Black women's evil, do things on the sly

You look for your supper to be good and hot

(Just as sure as you're born)
Lord, a natural-born eastman
(On the road again)

[Verse 2]
I went to my window, my window was propped
I went to my door, my door was locked
I stepped right back, I shook my head
A big black nigga's in my folding bed
I shot through the window, I broke the glass
I never seen a little nigga run so fast

[Hook 2]
He's on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
Lord, a natural-born eastman
(On the road again)
He's on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
God, a natural-born eastman
(On the road again)

[Verse 3]
Your friend at your house just to rest his hat
Next thing he wanna know where your husband's at
She says "I don't know he's on his way to the pen"
Come on mama, let's get on the road again

[Hook 3]
She's on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
Lord, a natural-born eastman
(She's on the road again)
He's on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
Lord, a natural-born eastman
(On the road again)

[Verse 4]
I'm with my black woman let me tell you
(Why)
Black women's evil, do things on the sly
(No)
You look for your supper to be good and hot
(Hot)
She never put the neck bone in the pot

[Hook 1]
She's on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
Lord, a natural-born eastman

Honeys with bodies with Bravehearts, guns in the party
Waves, braids, and baldies, trademark's the army
Is that Horse? It must be, I heard he husky

And that's Nas dancing with dimes but who his man is?
The imperial thug, it's cold D Grand Wiz

Stroke both holes, pass it to Nas
Or pass it to Naish, or pass it to Jung
Or pass it to Horse, then that ass getting tossed
Fuck a Hustler book, Penthouse or Black Tail
I got bitches sending my niggas flicks in jail
I fuck a bitch face more than her waist for real
And ain't no pussy like new pussy that's how a nigga feel
Bust three times, throw her the peace sign, she sleep
Then my dick sleep and I ain't gotta call her for weeks

Little young thing go around my dick with your tongue ring
Deep throat my nine inch, gut from the front and
Grind from the side and fuck from behind and
Grab her hair slap her ass, she screaming like she dying
Make her cum four times without even trying
I'll beat that pussy up there's no denying
Hit her where she doodie at, make the booty fat
Little cutie rat walking by with the doobie wrap
Tight blue jeans, Air Max, small Gucci bag
No loot and no job, stay home giving blow jobs
Like no prob, it's simple
Holla out the window it's the project nympho
Fuck my whole crew, you know how we do
You got that good pussy I can share with my people
Be a brave girl, do your thang

[Verse 4: Horse]
When it comes to sex I'm similar to the Thriller in Manilla
Bitches call me Horse the pussy filler
I'll fuck a big boned or slim chick
Beat that pussy up real quick then send home the bitch
Ain't no sleeping in my bedroom when Henny's in my dick
When Flex drop the bomb I bust a nut on this bitch
Deep throat, ceaser gold or pun wicked hoes
Who like the way I thug and the way I flow
I like head in the Benz, the four door or the Coupe
Head in the staircase, the cellar or the roof
Head in the studio, the bathroom or the booth
Head from a project chick or one with crazy loot
Like Nia Long in a cherry thong with the lights on
Sipping Perignon with Kelly Price on
I pull out my python, I hit it while my wife's gone
Long dick the bitch all night, I'll make her pussy sing the song

[Chorus]

I really love his thug and gangsta style



Dear Young Warriors fighting the wrong wars! Killing each other is definitely played out. Being hurt from the lost of a love one was never cool.

Dear Young Warriors fighting the wrong war! I know that feeling, that frustration with life and needing to take it out on someone, any one. But....

We chose the dumbest things to go the hardest for. I remember seeing deaths over 8 ball jackets, Fila sneakers, and name plate chains. Deaths over "he say, she say"!!!!! "I'm from this block or I'm from that block", or "my moms n pops is f*cked up now the whole world gotta pay"!!!

I remember feeling like I was the hardest "n*gga" breathing. And I couldn't wait to prove it. But let's think. What are we really proving?? And proving what to who?? Everybody knows Chicago breeds the strongest of the strong but I just feel, me, being ya brother from another state feels your pain as if I grew up with you in ya very own household.

You have the ability and mindpower to change they way we are looked at. Look who's watching us young warriors, look who's throwing us in jail constantly, look at the ignorance in the world. Look at the racist dogs who love to see us down. Loving to bury us in the ground or in jail where we continue this worthless war on one another.

Young warriors.... We are WASTING more and more time. We gotta get on our jobs and take over the world. Cuz this movie left the theaters years ago, Juice, Menace, Boyz n the Hood , Blood n Blood Out, Belly!

When we see each other why do we see hatred? Why were we born in a storm, born soldiers, WARRIORS....and instead of building each other up we are at war with each other.. May the soul of this young person find peace with the almighty. I'm with you young warriors. You're me and I'm you. But trust me! you are fighting the wrong war.
-Nas



[Verse 1:]
Nasir bin Olu Dara bis do Allah
Fist full of dollars in a dice game god
D & D glass cloth Kangols guided by angel with white wings
Nas the Viking fresh from my ankles thankful
Gangster see gangster do I'm Langston Hughes predecessor
Gun on my dresser slang I use upset college professor
More knowledge than Webster dictionary obituary column plus sign 'em
The first fake rapper murdered for rhyming
The jig is up gut 'em like fish swiss cheese 'em up
My wrist is freezing up sick of these ducks on my hiatus
Poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers
But they small as a shanty in a African village
Soft as cotton candy we assassins and killers
Let shottie off in club floors pellets spraying your familia
You screaming like you love war

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Everybody's crazy
Somebody's gonna get shot get rob get done get stomp get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thug love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop

[Nas:]
Peace fuck you with a fist in your ass
You pussy with yeast, you shook of the streets, you a Sisq fag
You know blood baths I makes 'em fake thugs I hate 'em
8 slug I'm bustin' no discussion or waiting
Cause now Instead of coke rhymes it's laying
No analog it's digital criminals turned rapper times is changing
Niggas get flashier houses more plusher
Bitches giving ass up at ages more younger
Hands on the clock keep turning, hands on a Glock they keep squeezing
Bullets stop in your sternum they stop you from breathing
I'm light year far your mouth get all white
When I'm near you I frighten your heart
I want you to watch me notice stare look closely
Feel I'm who you posed to be real I know it hurts you
Soldiers approach you, you want to squash it, you older than most dudes
Although Nas did you and your whole crew, but

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
I know where niggas sleep; it's too many schemes too many plots
War plus money man I got too many spots
Hungry niggas get tutored to thinking new shit to come up
Killers fuck with killers you sleeping you getting stuck up
Not me your not ready I'm low but I be watching
We all connected so your man know my man
Your man knows my fam' they was cool when they was locked up
Beat cases and now niggas back on the block what
Bothers is taking secret routes when they drive
Tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job
Peep niggas that got prices on their head so high
Their own my will take the contract surprise
So we play a mental game intimidation
Got pussy niggas get pressed up on and paying
I wish these niggas would step up wait for the day an
Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying
Who ever thinking coming to my vault for the safe
I got some niggas with acid get it thrown in your face
Play dirty catch your moms in J-30
Whatever whodie we all crazy we all 7:30 now

[Hook:]

[Intro]
Uh, light somethin', stop frontin'

[Verse 1: Nas]
How much money's enough? Think maybe like a trillion figures
Pray my daughter don't wild like the Hilton sisters
That'd kill me yo, filthy rich
My daughter pass it onto the next generation
Throwing carnations at my tombstone
In my new home, meet Mom's in my Yves Saint Laurent suit on
Then we do a dance
Like my man Luther jam, but my verse came first
I stole change out her purse, now I wanna dig her up
Outta the earth, too morbid, lean forward
Toward a new paragraph, Blue carrots, D-class
Strictly that kush in the weed bags
Tryna' figure out what Barry Gordie had put in production
Studio's smokey now, hard like Davin Ruffin
Hit a spliff through a seance, and uh, play on, playa

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Gotta' get your papes on, play on, playa
Before it's all gone, sip Don, tip waiters
Do y'all thing, mnage, swing, baby
Spend dubs on your bruhs, gotta live crazy
Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Get your papes on, play on, playa
Get your papes on, play on, playa

[Verse 2: Nas]
Ruby red grapefruit juice with Grey Goose
Rubies in the Jesus piece, pimped out like Snoopy
But a East Coast thing, my girl's stocking
Tied up in a knot top of my bean head
Billion dollar dream head, went from triple beams to digitals
Servin' fiends to minimal, sixty G's
No criminal, no mo', just mo' dough
Mimosas pouring, Oprah's earrings
On fingers while your girl performs cunnilingus
Cause this big money aroma lingers
Barber cleans his blade, then they give me a fade
Hot towel on the face, hot models who vomit
After they eat so they can stay lightweight
Swallowin' my protein like an Ovaltine shake
Come through like Mo Green from Godfather, so clean
Where I step I 'Clorox it', keep twenty G's
On both sides of the thighs, that's four pockets
Eighty thou to browse for the nicest price
But we ain't into buyin' conflict ice
That's the shit they stole from the Congo, and other black soil
True mack fo' you, nappy hair just spinning
Honey gave me a massage with a happy ending
Finest females, I just came on and sprayed her
Got to get your papes on, play on, playa

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snoop]
It's kinda hard for a playa like you
But let me show you how a nigga like me get revenue
What you never do is punk out, what you better do
Never let the game get ahead of you, get a better view
Better yet, a better crew, praise God, I'm a marry you
Get ya holy, carry you, bury you, slowly
Roll me another blunt, stuff it
Lick it, puff it, tuck it, fuck it
That man, that game, that thing it busts
In D-O-Double-G we trust
Yup, yup, young loc with the two steps
He creepin' with two TEC's, they sleepin' with two chicks
Right before we blast, all you heard was two clicks (Bloaw!)
End of existence, for instance
Rewind, replay it, re-chop it, remix it, re-twist it
Goddamn, D-O-Double-G, cuz, we missed it
Travel slow, I'm an Indian, but not a Navajo
I smoke the big leaf, end all the big beefs
My hair in two braids, I'm the big chief
La-da-da, be-da-ba-da
Yeah, break that down, how fresh you are?
The king from Queens, Mr. Escobar
Connect with the best from the West, yes-yes, you are
Oh my God, it's Snoop Dogg and Nas; playa, play on



Light somethin', stop frontin'
How much money's enough? Think maybe like the trillion figures
Pray my daughter don't wild like the Hilton Sisters
That'd kill me yo, filthy rich
My daughter pass it on to the next generation
Throwing carnations at my tombstone
In my new home, meet moms in my Yves St. Laurent suit on
Then we do a dance like my man Luther Jam
But my verse came first

Now I wanna dig her up outta the earth
Too morbid, learn forward toward a new paragraph
Blue carats, D-Class, strictly that kush in the weed bag
Tryna figure out what Berry Gordy had put in production
Studio smoky now, hard like David Ruffin
Hit a spliff through a sance
And I, play on playa
Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Gotta get your papes on, play on playa
Before it's all gone, sip Dom, tip waiters
Do the yacht thing, mnage swing, baby
Spendin' dubs on your buzz, gotta live crazy
Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Get your papes on, play on playa
Get your papes on, play on playa
Get your papes on
Ruby red grapefruit juice with Grey Goose
Rubies in Hey-Zeus piece
Pimped out like Snoop be, but an East Coast thing
My girl stocking tied up in a knot, top of my bean head
Billion dollar dream hear
Went from triple beams to digital
Serving fiends, the minimal, 60 G's, no criminal
No mo', just mo' doe, mimosas pouring, Oprah's earrings on fingers
While your girl performs cunnilingus
'Cause this big money aroma lingers
Barber cleans his blade, then he give me a fade
Hot towel on the face
Hot models who vomit after they eat so they can stay lightweight
Swallowing my protein like an Ovaltine shake
Come through like Moe Green from Godfather, so clean
Where I step, I Clorox it
Keep 20 G's on both sides of the thighs, that's four pockets
Eighty thousand, browse for the nicest price
But we ain't into buying Conflict Ice
That's the **** they stole from the Congo and other black soil
True mack for you, nappy hair, just spinnin'

Slowly, roll me another blunt stuff it
Lick it, puff it, tuck it, **** it
That man, that gang, that bang it was
In D O double G we trust
Yep yep, young loc with the two steps

Right before he blast, all you heard was two clicks
End of existence, for instance
Rewind it, replay it, re-chop it, remix it
Re-twist it, goddamn D O double G, 'cause we missed it

Oh, my God, it's Snoop Dogg and Nas, playa play on



[Produced by Kanye West & Mad Rapper]

[Intro]
To my nigga
Who brought me in this world
Ha, that's right nigga

[Verse 1]
My ol' dad important to the family structure, provider, a God
My moms a queen, that universal team civilized us
My pops maybe was late but always came home
My moms would put us to bed and she would wait on
Soon as he walk in the door she barking
I turned down the Johnny Carson
Jumped out the bed, we grabbed both his legs
Me and my brother, not knowing the pain he gave my mother
Night after night, fighting, yelling at each other
My poppa played the street all day, mama was either home
Or at work, while we played inside the hall way
She sacrifices all she got to feed us
When she was alone she cried by the phone peeping out the window heated
But still I didn't see it, mama hid it from us
We was kids younger, 'til we got bigger, on to
Bigger things that we knew what the time was
That daddy was leaving his crib and mom's love

[Chorus]
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
"(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down"
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
"(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down"

[Verse 2]
So many kids I knew, never knew who pop was
That's why I show my pop love
He was still around when I popped up
He could have left my moms pregnant, shook to death
But stayed, watched me crawl 'til I took my first step
To the first grade, to my first fistfight
Right behind me he would stand
No matter how big or tall, he made me fight you like a man
Throw dirt in ya eye, swing my right, scoop your ass and slam
He watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam
Roaches of weed all over my crib, him and moms relaxing
Next thing you know he packing, so then I asked him
"What's this white shit on that plate and your face?
And, Poppa, why you butt-ass from the waist
And, who's this lady I'm facing?
Dark skin, you're not my mommy!"
He grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me
Promise me things that he would buy me
If I kept my mouth closed and don't tell mommy
He said one day I'll understand, "Little me
What's in you is inside me"

[Chorus]
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
"(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down"
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
"(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down"

[Verse 3]
Uhh, my nigga
Pops told me hold my own
Pops told me value home
Could I help it poppa was a rolling stone?
Who loved the pretty brown round, outta town bound
Trumpet in his jazz band, he touring
At home I play his latest recordings
And it's strange now how I do my thing now, I'm in the game now
Inherited his brainpower, to pull strings and gain power
From weed habits are the same now
No white lines, no trumpets, just tight rhymes
And beats that be pumpin, 'fore he left, he taught me something
A child's young years the most important time to be there
That's why he stayed 'til we grew up, respect is still here
I'm older now, see what having a father's about
One day they can be in your life, next day, they be out
It's not because of you, you know the deal
Him and your moms feel
If they stay together then someone will get killed
I love you still, always will, 'cause that's my nigga
Although you felt you was wrong, I still feel you kid
Life goes on...



Ayo I hit the Earth like a comet, Invasion
Nas is like the afrocentric asian
Right here with the amazing Green Lantern
Serious radio, yall know what it is

NaS too real, NaS true king
You know the king

Cars with police radars on highways boppin
Bullpin therapy cell block dodging
Pissy stairways missed them days not when
They shut down the stores when Im shopping
Used to be pop locking, train hopping
Face covered in stocking
Six pack Bud drinking gambler
Fuck them cameras in front of the man
Sing the hustlers mantra, hands of luck
More hits than gambling huff
I hollered Indosia, 40 belows covered the toes
I was a soldier with the Popeyes sippin Amota
Nigga honestly I call this a culture
My sisters a snake, my brothers a vulture
My mothers the block, my fathers a ghetto piranha
Swimming with sharks my tones false settle drama
Obama, if the kids mirror you
Well all push Masaratis with the silver hue
They fear that connection
I rather die in a box than live safe in witness protection
Gotti was a racist but he still get praises
We dont give a fuck, nigga gangsta is gangsta
Bricks come with Bill Clintons name on it taped up
Hollywood Lohan parties people they facing them
Kim Kardashian, body with the waist slim
Know some hood girls who did time that could take them
Rappers changing families, fags are all lost
Im at the Waldorf, Vancleave under the sleeve
Save the small talk, I feel alive
New Porches Jordan number fives
Already said Im the last real nigga alive

Nas, let my words guide you
From crips to piru this is survival
Turn my voice up
Let my words guide you
From crips to piru this is survival
Invasion!



[Nas]
"What we need to be thinkin' about is the future!
We don't know what's in store tomorrow!
All we can do is just guess! We want the best for tomorrow;
For our family, for our children, for our future
But if we don't get up andact like we want it
We gotta pray to somebody! We ain't to tough to pray!
You walkin' around like a gangsta, gangstas pray! Thugs pray!
Tell me somethin'; if you ain't prayin', where would y'all be today?
Where would y'all momma be today? How would you be here?
Somebody prayin' for you, nigga!"

[Horse]
I never thought bein' a man you could hang in the end
Facin' life with no parol and consecut' sentencin'
Got people witnessin', your co-defendent snitchin'
Your back against the wall, your left eye is twitchin'
Loyal ladies usual, a D-and A's the mutual
Scared to face the light of a courtroom site
Racist cops on each side cause the know I just might
Make a break for the door but I give it my all
If I die in this struggle, give my momma a call
Cause she always left these jewels: what goes up must fall
Since I fell dead broke, landed in jail
Refused to face the facts, how wifey skipped to town with the bail
I'm on my own now, V8, far away from home now
Palmer wealth state, the law changes each date
Secret inditements got me knocked, there ain't no price I can pay
To get me the fuck up out this shit, so to Allah I pray
For forgiveness - Yes, I sinned and I need to be held
And jail ain't no place a black man wanna be killed
Amen

I only pray when shit is fucked up!
I only pray when my life is lookin' bad luck!
I only pray when I'm in mothafuckin' handcuffs!
Callin' out for someone, somewhere!
Is there anybody out there?

[Wiz]
I look up at the sky, why do young niggas die?
Felt the stray hit me, somebody stay with me
Fallin' to the ground with the sound of a four-pound near me
Bitches screamin', wish I was dreamin'
I fought a thousand gun fights, near one bullet skipped me
On the morning run to get my little sisters Rice Krispies
Played the numbers knowin' that I got my lucky dice wit' me
See some niggas I know I can roll - Uh, uh!
Get them bitches, left all of them broke, left what they smoke
Hoes yellin', 'Watch ya back!'
But before I could turn around, before I could I react
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Would you look at me now?
Is this blood that I feel as I fell to the ground?
Feel like a head shot but maybe just grazed my temple
Niggas diggin' in my pockets, sayin' I just rolled a pimple
Yo, my mouth was movin' but it was nothin' I was sayin'
Only if they knew deep inside my mind, I was prayin'
Amen

I only pray when shit is fucked up!
I only pray when my life is lookin' bad luck!
I only pray when I need his help the most, what?!
Callin' out to someone, somewhere!
Yo, is anybody out there?

[Jungle]
Ain't nothin' stoppin' me - Untouchable - Hoes, I fucked a few
Style like The Greatest, Ali - Check what the knuckle do
Rock bubblegoose to mink, big links
Yellow ice, live the ghetto life, 'fuck y'all think?
Bravehearted; fuck around, get graveyarded
Dearly departed - The word on the street, I'm a target
I ain't runnin', I ain't hidin', I'm ridin'
I be gunnin', y'all be duckin' and divin'
When I come through buckin' this four-fivin'
Revenge you sayin' you gettin'
But shit is gettin' too wild, this lifestyle of sprayin' weapons
So I check out the preacher - Life is off the meter
Thoughts of homicide, tryin' to dodge the reaper
Confessions in a church cause it hurts, behind a curtain
Nigga talkin' to me, but I ain't certain
Voice sound familiar so I pulled the shade back
It was this stupid nigga that I popped way back
He set me up, he just got to the preist
I tried to reach but he had his heat pointed my way
And said, 'Pray'

[Nas]
"You've got to pray, huh! I mean pray, pray
And when you pray, you got to look up to the lord, huh!
You got to look up and you got to pray for your children, huh!
You got to pray for that man in front of the liquor store, huh!
You got to pray for that man on the corner! He know he doin' wrong
But somebody gotta pray for him, huh! You know we doin' wrong
But we gotta pray for ourselves! You know we are headin'
To this new millennium, goddamnit! They say a comet is comin'
To this world by the year two-thousand, I say it's God! It's up to you
To pray to that higher power higher than yourself and humble yourself
And, and, and beg for forgiveness cause it comes back to you!
A man told me that while he was in jail, all he did was pray
All he did was stay in his jail cell and pray to God..."



[Intro 1: Malcolm X sample]
The white power structure of today is just as much interested in perpetuating slavery
As the white power structure was 100 years ago
Only now they use modern methods of doing so
And, uh

[Intro 2: Paul Mooney sample]
White folks made up nigga and don't want me to say it
Ain't that a bitch?
You made it up, you shouldn't have made it up!
You done fucked up, you shouldn't have made up nigga
And you made up a song to go with it
Please don't make me sing the song
Eenie meenie minie
You know the god damn song I'm talking about
And you change the words when you see black folks

[Verse: Nas]
This is my opening scripture - I've been preparing this album
My whole life, might be uncomfortable for most you listeners
Satan's bombarding me with propositions, but I decline
I started in the Bridge without a pot to piss in
I overcame all the opposition
My teachers told that I'd a broken mayne on a cot in prison
Cloaked in the finest drapes, not Bathing Apes
But we still filthy, Supreme Court say we still guilty
This is the Genesis, and I don't even see a worthy arch nemesis
I get loose like the Jena Six, they put a noose on 'Pac
Now I'm defending Vick, and free that nigga T.I.P
I'd take the grave or a bid
Then let some dirty clan members run up in my crib
And plant cracks on the man that's going to church
Plants packs on the man that's going to work
And build cases, meanwhile they daddies and they brothers
Is recruiting all my brothers and cousins to fill bases
The nerve of y'all to call Escobar a racist
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga hatred



[Intro: Eban Thomas]
It is absolutely silly, and unproductive
To have a funeral for the word "nigga"
When the actions continue..
We need to have a movement to resurrect brothers, and sisters
Not a funeral for niggers
Cause niggers - DON'T DIE {*echoes*}

[Verse: Nas]
Uh, yeah..
Yo, I'm creepy and crawlin', in your sink and your toilet
I be drinkin' from your spit, anything cause I'm all less
An insect with four legs; people come in, I fake dead
Correction: I got eight legs, climbin' on top yo' plate, bed
Wherever I smell food, it could be even jail food
Stale food that's molded, a roach is what I am, fool
The ghetto is my land, fool, I'ma never be able to
Fly like a bumblebee, try not, to be underneath
Your sneaker, pitiful creature, I'm not afraid of
Your pesticide or RAID cause, in heaven's my Creator
I love it when the light's off, eatin' from same knives, forks
From, any man's dinner, see my antennas
You can't win, you can't stand the crunchy sound I make
If you squash me, learn to live with me
How much your roach motel costin' you in the city?
But yo, we everywhere, check your house good, I bet we there!
Look there!

[Outro: Eban Thomas]
Niggers are like roaches - they're never gonna go away
Learn from them what we should not become
Cause niggers - DON'T DIE {*echoes*}



[Produced by Trackmasters]

[Verse 1: Nas]
Black hoods, cops and projects, sewers flooded with foul blockage
The gutter's wild and every child watches
Chains in top locks get ripped off hinges
Doors kicked off, drunks stag off Smirnoff, wipe your beard off
Crippled dope fiends in wheelchairs stare, vision blurry
'Cause buried deep in they mind are hidden stories
Bet he's a mirror image of that 70's era
He's finished for the rest of his life, 'til he fades out
The liquor store workers miss him but then it plays out
So many ways out the hood, but no signs say out
Mental slavehouse where gats go off, I show off
Niggas up north, prison-ology talk, 'til they time cut off
You should chill if you short, prepare deep thought
To hit the street again, get it on, get this paper and breathe again
Plan to leave somethin' behind
So your name'll live on, no matter what the game lives on

[Chorus: Ron Isley]
Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out)
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window
(Oh, I'm lookin' out)
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo, if this piano's the cake, then my words are the candles
Light it up, make a wish, and them angels will grant you
Impatient once tried, but in those angels and bamboo
They lit it up {*puff puff*}, hit it up {*puff*}, now they dismantled
Think the whole world is crazy, got a nine, watch where you walk Two dollar fine, sign of the times here in New York
Hire Satan, United Nations quietly taken, toll on your soul
Take it or leave it, just my evaluation
Stack loot and guns, teach the girls karate, school your sons not to hate
But to stay awake, 'cause the scars a razor make is nothin' in comparison
To the gas left on this whole mass, if we don't get it controlled fast
Might as well be, laughin' with Malcolm X's assassin as we die slow
Perishin', brain dead from a Ericsson
Words are the medicine, two teaspoons for goons
A cup of it for those thuggin' it, y'all sing the tune, uhh

[Chorus: Ron Isley]
Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out)
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window
(Oh, I'm lookin' out)
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired

[Verse 3: Nas]
Another day, another dollar, my mother will holla
She said, "go and see the world for myself, and my brother should follow
Pops was smooth, from his top to his shoes
Sang the blues, guitar strings he played smokin' his Kool
Duke Ellington hat, picture this yo, seventies cat
He wrote his music in the back of the crib, I did my homework
At night the windows were speakers, pumpin' life out
A fight, people screamin' 'cause somebody pulled a knife out
So I look at this room, I'm hooked to this tune
Every night the same melody, hell sounded so heavenly
But jail was ahead of me, speedin' like amphetamine
Reading's what I should've done, 'cause my imagination would run
I was impatient to get out and become part of the noise out there
I used to stare, five stories down, basketball courts, shot up playgrounds
And I witnessed the murders and police shake-downs
Yo, the hustla's and hoes, drugs and fo'-fo's
This was the life of every kid, lookin' out project windows

[Chorus: Ron Isley]
Oh, outta my window
Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out)
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window
(Oh, I'm lookin' out)
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired
Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out)
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window
(Oh, I'm lookin' out)
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired

[Outro: Ron Isley]
Starin' out of, out my window
Oh I, feel so tired
Oh yeah, outta my window
Oh, lookin' out, lookin' out of
Lookin' out my window, oh yeah
Makes me, feel so tired
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired



[Intro]
Light it, uhh
Light it up, uhh

[Verse 1]
The whole city is mine, prettiest Don
I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers
Why it's mentioned in my rhymes? Fuck it
It's just an intro, hate it or love it, like it, bump it or dump it
Write it, across the stomach spell "God son"
Life is like a jungle, black, it's like the habitat of Tarzan
Matter of fact, it's harder than most can imagine
Most of my niggas packed in correctional facilities
Half of them passed on, MAC strong, couple of shots
Made the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin' the block
Where they used to stand at, somebody's takin' they place
A younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that
Same walk, same talk, I wonder can that be possible?
A thug dies, another step inside his shoes
And they will hurt you, layin' low with a bottle
I'm blowin' circles, my state of mind purple

[Break]
Light it, light it, uhh
Yeah light it up
Light it up, uhh

[Verse 2]
Y'all just wanna deal with drama
Talk about niggas who got things, y'all ready to kill his mama
Everything you into is underworld related
You sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred
You don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin' soldiers
To pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder
Think of how many dudes died tryna be down with you
Everybody's under six feet of ground but you
Still standin', still roamin' through the streets, that's real
You a survivor, knowin' all the beef is ill
You got a bunch of thugs with you even now that's ready
Trustin' your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly
The hood love you, but behind your back they pray for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That ain't love, it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes
Whose sons you killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars holdin' a mirror
Lookin' down a tear in jail, makin' weapons to kill ya
Weed smoke, three tokes, nigga, pour more Henny
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
Cold-blooded murderers, universal
Hood to hood, blowin' smoke, state of mind is purple

[Break]
Light it up, light it up, light it up, uhh
Light it up light it up, light it up, uhh
Uhh uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh

[Verse 3]
These hot-headed youngsters always get into trouble
Reactin' before thinkin', they easily irritated
And murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin'
When we should be climbin', in a nutshell, it's just jail
Drug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggas rewindin'
Instead of movin' forward to blow up, so what's the science?
People shoutin', police pushin' the crowd
And on the ground's a young soldier with meat hangin' out him
Am I hallucinatin' off the hazin'?
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in?
It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of suspect faces
It's usually two or three niggas who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch
A divide-and-fall strategy, they aren't fair
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair
This Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy
And Celie, Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me
This is how I escape the madness
Too much of anything'll hurt you, so my state of mind's all purple



[Intro]
Uh
Crazy (crazy), ah (ah)
Yo pussy kill me...
Huh (huh).. yeah (yeah) yeah..
Huh, huh, huh, huh..

[Verse 1]
Pussy killed me when I was born (What?)
Pardon me, I'll rephrase it: departed mommy's womb decaying
I look at the bright side
The fact that I got a life side
Born '73 - September right Nas? (True)
Virgo child, the first thing I learn is money makes the world go round
On this small planet, it's ten women to one man; I wonder how we manage
To say vows and walk a straight line in marriage
Niggas is some nasty creatures (word)
Bitches even nastier, they throw at your boy and it's hard for me to pass it up
Freaky hoes lick a nigga's ass and nuts
Stupid bitch bragging 'til her baby dad went nuts (stupid bitch)
Now he looking for me, two cars deep
Rolling up on nigga's, barrel out the window, asking, "You Nas peeps?"
I can't have that, two four five, nigga grab that
Pass it to me, sucker-for-love niggas I blast at
I swear my dick is gonna get me in trouble
I pissing bubbles
I thought I felt a sharp pain, better stick to rubbers
When laying hooker after hooker, day out and day in
Watch out for diseases, the doctors can't name 'em
Just a thought: we all fuck the same chicks
Some play like they innocent, fucking entertainers
And basketball players, the bitch is a ho
But still some of y'all a save her, put your dick in her throat
You just the nigga that done wifed her (huh?)
She drove you crazy, now your monkey ass wanna shoot the pimp that pipes her
She had your baby, (damn) now you a life-er
And suicide notes you write her, pussy kills

[Chorus]
Oh what a thrill
Inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real
Pussy kills
Backs shots keep a nigga open
Bitch'll have a nigga's gun smoking
Huh, pussy kills
Oh what a thrill
Inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real
Pussy kills
Backs shots keep a nigga open
Bitch'll have a nigga's gun smoking
Huh, pussy kills

[Verse 2]
My nigga James got married, same girl he went to school with
Nice girl, nerd with glasses, he was too stuck
Studied for her Masters, part time nurse
I'll tell you how superb the ass is, but who's looking
I mean that's my man, maybe I just took a peek
Maybe I wondered what it would be like, sike
'Cause James and me like I was with AZ like
Luke and Han Solo
Fucking with niggas' girls' forbidden, that's a no-no
It's death and we real niggas, civilized Gods
And their ain't too many niggas like Nas, I'm trust worthy
Plus I know a dude that caught his wife cheating
Killed his baby, killed his wife, and took his own life, even
Happy for James 'cause real bitches hard to come by
This nigga found one, I told him he's lucky, we clown some
Rolling up dutchies while watching Roy Jones in round one, he froze
Put his face to the TV, 'bout an inch close
Move out the way nigga, fuck's the matter with you, you blind?
He pointed to the front row, thought he was loosing his mind
She 'posed to be with her sick mother, left for the weekend
Was stressed when she was leaving
Now she's next to some nigga, cheesing
He's having trouble breathing (gasping for air, coughing)
He pictured 'em making noises, grinding him and kissing him
Yelling, "Ain't no telling where her lips have been!"
Left her foul messages, she came home no lesser than
Ten minutes later, then they start wrestling and screaming
She said she missed her flight that evening
She never left, she wasn't at that fight, you speeding
That's Vegas, this is New York, you bugging
I held up my hand for a dap but he wouldn't touch it
I'm like, "When you started acting like that? This is dumbness."
Gave me a crazy look and started swinging punches
I ducked, couldn't believe it, the nigga so whipped
He got his gat and started squeezing, hit two policemen
Neighbors dialed 911, they heard the thumping
Wounded cops kicked in the door and started dumping
Me and his wife dip to the floor she smiled strange
My comrade was breathing no more, they killed James

[Chorus]
Oh what a thrill
Inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real
Pussy kills
Backs shots keep a nigga open
Bitch'll have a nigga's gun smoking
Huh, pussy kills
Oh what a thrill
Inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real
Pussy kills
Backs shots keep a nigga open
Bitch'll have a nigga's gun smoking
Huh, pussy kills



[Verse]
Talking to this cutie on FaceTime
Trying to figure out if she gon' give me that face time
I don't wanna tour, I wanna chill with my son more
Teach him about Egypt and tranquility, critically analyze black lives and respectability
Why Prodigy mural get vandalized?, why Prodigy?
The project politics obviously
Demagogue democracy, in the fog I see the mob represented into the light
Back to the source where all energy comes
Your enemy, dunn, was internal
A disease that needs a vaccination
Plagues black seeds
The industry ain't as friendly as it first seems
When you dream of drivin' your whip to ya house in Florida Keys
On behalf of me and Queens and all of the Gs
Bandana P will always stand as tall as the trees
First things first, this should be understood
QueensBridge, just ain't any other hood
It's music, legacy is incredibly high pedigree
I don't mean this disrespectfully alphabetically
If it's hard to swallow and the credits of B street singing this Bernard Fowler
He sang with the Rolling Stones, background for Bootsy Collins
Marley Marl's advanced raps sound perfect timing
The early 80's, we babies, Pebblee Poo dropped
The beat was crazy and Marly was changing hip-hop
Then Marly and Shant caught a body, UTFO
She cold, "Roxanne's Revenge", she was 14 years old
Then came the Juice Crew and the who's whos
G Rap, Rakim and Kane, beats made in the QU
I was probably playing with .32s in the lobby
It's QueensBridge over everything and everybody
I wish the 'book never came out
And everything got straightened out
Before you left, I saw you, it was all love
Except we needed to build more and get things correct
Now I gotta accept it, cause there's honor in death
Wish you was here with us P

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shout out to Havoc, shout out to Pone
Shout out to Jungle
Shout out to Jeff
Shout out to Big Lord
The big dog (Lord)
Free Bar, Spark (Bar, Spark)
It's a lot going on
Free the kings
It's a lot going on man, it's heavy
Goodfellas man
Prodigy man
It's heavy man
We need to lighten it up
To all ya
My bros



[Produced by Jay Electronica]

[Verse]
Ayo, Queens get the money, niggas still screaming, paper chasing
Where presidential candidates is planning wars with other nations
Over steak with Masons
Pregnant teens give birth to intelligent gangsters, they daddies faceless
Play this, by your stomach, let my words massage it and rub it
I'll be his daddy if there's nobody there to love it
Tell him his name Nasir, tell him how he got here
Mama was just having fun with someone above her years
Niggas is still hating, talking that Nas done fell off with rhyming
He'd rather floss with diamonds
They pray "Please God, let him spit that Uzi in the army lining
That shorty doo-wop rolling oo-wops in the park reclining"
Take 27 emcees, put 'em in a line and they're out of alignment
My assignment since he said retirement
Hiding behind 8 Mile and The Chronic
Gets rich but dies rhyming, this is high science
Now add 23 more from Queens to B-more
I'm over their heads like a bulimic on a seesaw
Now that's 50 porch monkeys ate up at the same time
Nasty Nasdaq, y'all gon' bow holmes, this Dow Jones
.80 cal chrome, needed time alone to zone
The mack left his iPhone and his 9 at home
My queen used her milkshake to bring y'all to my slaughterhouses
I do this for the group home kids in boarding houses
This that nigga shit that's on the album
For them niggas inside the chalk line in 40 houses
Bring back Arsenio
Hip-hop was aborted so Nas breathes life, back into the embryo
Let us make man in our image, spit it, I'm Huey P in Louis V
At the eulogy throwing Molotovs for Emmett
And you ain't as hot as I is
All of these false prophets is not messiahs
You don't know how high the sky is
The square mileage of Earth or what pi is
I'm the shaky hand that touched George Foreman in Zaire
The same hand that punched down devils that brought down the Towers



[Verse 1]
At fourteen tried out for the ball team
Junior high, they denied me
I shot bricks that made the backboard scream
Fightin' Italian rival gangs, they was sniffin' glue
I was skippin' school, smokin' green, that was the shit to do
Stole somebody team jacket at practice, slept through my classes
The borough Queens, so it's rep the Q to the casket
Average student, had illusions of the supernatural
Horror movie addict, werewolf fanatic and Dracul'
One night after school and train hoppin' and snatchin' jewels
I dozed at midnight, woke up a little after two
My hands shook violently
My eyes took red
My hair spun in ways
Bread was the only word I said
I heard voices in the nights calling, the Benz engine roaring
Heard that gin and champagne pourin' and niggas ballin'
I put the .22 on my waist
The face in the moon had a mean look
I transformed to the Queens wolf

[Chorus]
You could hear me growlin' through public housin'
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bussin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'
You could hear me growlin' through public housin'
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bussin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'

[Verse 2]
Waking up is a pleasure though last night I can't remember
Cash up on my dresser, where'd it come from?
This is messed up
What kind of fatal drug am I taking? who laced it?
Previous night, memories who erased it?
Wasn't even wasted
I do recall the nightfall, lunar, the stars around it
Then my man called, said what I did, the goons were talkin' 'bout it
Singin' me praises, said I lit the corners up
It sounded like Vietnam screamin' out "QBietnam" the loudest
"Homie them dudes is scared you gon' spray 'em, word to Bing
They'll do anything, pay you real good to be on their team"
So that explain the money and the chains that's on my dresser drawer
That wasn't there a day before, I should press 'em all
But I be on some cool shit, nigga, my QU shit
Audemars watch, burn a peach Swish', new whip
Stoli' vodka, club soda with my new chick
Ah shit, teeth showing, snarling when the moon's lit

[Chorus]
You could hear me growlin' through public housin'
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bussin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'
You could hear me growlin' through public housin'
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bussin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'

[Intro: Nas]
Where my real niggas at
There's a lot of real niggas out there
There's a lot of real niggas everywhere
That's why you don't fuck with just anybody
A lot of niggas is just on the low, chillin'
Not botherin' nobody, until one muthafucka fuck with 'em
And then all hell break loose

[Chorus: Nas]
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga

[Verse 1: Grand Wizard]
Well known gangstas, entrust, that we bust
Your heart and soul lies with us, let's see
Boldly go where we once took a nigga before
Now the motherfucker beggin' for more
It's Thorazine
Standin' here shakin', hatin' the haters, they watchin' my paper
Realize, a 4-5 will open his eyes
Now what the fuck you think he saw before he drop?
Nigga standin' there just like a cop
Braveheart I'm screamin up the block
Now the soldier, cadet, general in fact
Don't let me get up and show y'all muthafuckas respect
Plans connect
The twinklin' diamonds upon my neck
More Jazz than Hornacek
I blast, leave your corner wet
Straight on top of ya
Spittin' like the Trench Coat Mafia
In a schoolyard, we make it hard
What's poppin' y'all?
We made our change; what's stoppin' y'all?
They spray y'all names Rest in Peace on the project wall

[Chorus: Nas]
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga

[Verse 2: Horse]
I wave gang signs at the youth, that's down for the cause
Sling them things 'til the very end, you better get yours
Time is runnin' out
Your streets is gettin' smaller as we speak
Giuliani turns these lights on so niggas can't creep
I miss the shit out of David Dinkins
Please free John Gotti
They kept the black man eatin', not killin' everybody
Drug wars is real
You have no friends in the outfield
Foul balls is death, umpires keep ice grills
There's no tomorrow, it's the bottom of the 9-9
Can't die a broke man with a bitch that's fine
My heart's full of braveness, so who the fuck will want to save this
Fallen angel from fallen, startin' chaos on this nation
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin'
You could find us in the hood, thuggin' and regulatin'
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin'
You could find us in the hood, thuggin' and regulatin'

[Chorus: Nas]
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga

[Verse 3: Jungle]
Yo, we here to eat food, my peoples be lethal
Shots in your body make you see-through
Quiet niggas become jail riot niggas
25 to life bid, never cry niggas
Floss when they up north
Chest gettin' bigger
Celebs on the V.I., respect that nigga
Reggy on the regular, chops it up, like a editor
Come through one man gang like The Predator
If your wake, I'll wet it up, Jungle set it up
The jackal rock you to sleep while I'm comin' at you
Air out your area, Queensbridge forever, what
Ill Will the label
Bravehearts, y'all scared of us

[Verse 4: Nas]
Yo, when those niggas ran, these niggas stayed
When those niggas switched up and bitched up afraid
These niggas clicked up and ripped up the gauge
Those niggas got jail and sick 'cause we paid
Don't even rep QB, you ain't got hood stripes
Looters come through catch you frontin' and it's goodnight
Know how much force this is
Jungle, Horse, and Wiz
Nothin' but horses, kid
We go to war for this

[Chorus: Nas]
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga

[Produced by DJ Hot Day, Rodney Jerkins & Salaam Remi]

[Intro: Nas]
DJ Hot Day...

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that youre home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself

[Verse 1: Nas]
3:45AM can't sleep, can't dream
I'm stuck, money problems pop up
How will I survive?
Guess it's best to decide not to decide
So that's my decision
Whatever happens happens
I keep making my millions
Can see myself in Presidential campaign dinners
But I'm passing blunts around a bunch of gang members
When you're too hood to be in them Hollywood circles
And you're too rich to be in that hood that birthed you
And you become better than legends you thought were the greatest
And outgrow women you loved and thought you could stay with
Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror
And leave notes around for yourself to remember
I like to teach and build
With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mil
All you need is some skill, then its grind time
Imagination better than knowledge, says Einstein
Its all in the mind
Nasty the nicest, I'm somewhat of a psychic
Just one minute after it's heard
You all'll recite it, you all'll repeat it
You'll call me a genius, if you didn't
Now that I said it I forced you to think it
Write in my little vignettes, sipping Mot
Bitch when you vision me, you vision the best
When I was young they called me Olu's son
Now he's Nas' father, I was the good seed
He was the wise gardener

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that youre home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yeah, what y'all know about this..
Yo, beautiful life, often I dream that I can bring my niggas
Conservatives dont understand slang linguistics
The burbs talking like the hood will change with quickness
Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness
So what I rap about my riches and I'm ostentatious
Get out a gangsta's business, seems to me your thoughts are basic
Try to compare what you live to the life I master
See the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after
Big bracelets, golden Egyptian faces
White wine spritzers and Switzerland on vacation
The strip club scene favors Josephine Baker
Dope fiend neighbors, growing up I seen paper
I describe it, hope you can visualize it
This is reminiscent to all the parks in the project
When my British Knights can rival your Foamposites
Dont make me pull my Lottos out the closet
Don't make me pull my Lottos out the closet
Ha ha ha

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that youre home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
You remind me, ohhhhhhhhhh
Yes it's true baby, ahh yeah



Ruk:
Ill Will...yeah yeah yo...Queensbridge niggas...crud love baby..

Verse 1: (Ruk)
Aiyo, I zone out
Feelin' like I'm in Capone's house
Starin' at Manhattan and The Bridge with the chrome out
Ki's on the table, black tanktop, long cable
Thoughts of overtakin' the table
Dismantle and disable
Verbal, made fatal, what drug paper do
Straight duct tapin', apin' a few
Takin' Mo' and Henny straight and things loose
Puffin' the fruits, thug in a duece
Flaggin', pants saggin', fuckin' ya goose
I'm like nothin' to you
Dumpin' the Rug' and your group in a red coog'
Jump in the Isuzu and cruise
Blank tints, bulletproof, red Timb boots
Nigga loose, license plate screamin' "Fuck you"
Drunken days, I wish ya'll knew
Thug dreams, what it means to you
Red seams, triple beams
40 inch blings, Ill Will the fuckin' team
This for my niggas in the Bridge from Queens

Chorus (Nas)
Illmatic Ice, Goon, Sonny, and Smitty (real niggas)
Big Felton, Chick, Petey, and Sarge (real niggas)

Blink, Ice, Cliff, Super nice, and Draws (real niggas)

Verse 2: (Nas)
Bumpy Johnson style, old timers, crocodile shoes
Pinky rings, big rounders with tools, bossin' wild crews
Slacks, overlaps, applejack hats quarterfield coats
Cadillacs with white walls and chrome wheel spokes
They were organized, investin', had a piece of the hood
They had drugs, bettin' numbers, police understood
They played the Cotton club, red carpet, hoes on they arm
Plush mink, pimped out gangsta, civil rights wasn't won
Every Christmas they were Santa Claus, Nixon was the Anti-Christ
Bitches asses were bigger then, sniffin' nose candy white
Listenin' to Malcolm speak, talcum powder, shaving cream
Layin' back, barber chair, straight razor clean
Babies were born, big families started to blossom
Mad people just applied for apartments and got 'em
Used to be rules to this game of hustlers and dealers
From Tommy guns to MAC Tens it's Q.B.'s newborn killers

Verse 3: (Ruc)
96 buildings of children, guns, and bad feelings
Q.B. see we rep by the Millions
Each block, ten spots, a hundred different villians
In abundance my dunnettes run this drug dealin'
Stash the jums in hallway ceilings
Gangsta paradise, watch the ice, nigga make a killin'
In the cut on the steps yo gettin' good neck
Only in the projects, we die with respect
Pussy niggas quiet as kept will riot the set
Six blocks of real niggas vexed
Assorted irons and vests, stress on they chest
20 half a G's on Henny, Son, the whole hood is wet
In memory of...who's next?
Train they set, lend they Teck, earn your check
Nigga, you better rep
Real niggas come out the projects
40 to the 41st, Vernon to the 12th

[Chorus: Emily]
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?

[Verse 1: Nas]
By the time of age nine I'm already decidin'
If I can protect mommy from the hood by fightin'
Or usin' a knife or a gun when I'm twenty-one
By by then them hoods woulda pushed their way in our apartment
And we die then, so I been a young nervous wreck in the projects
Watchin' them older niggas pass pot and they high man
I'm just a young boy, snot nose, hair nappy
Cops ride by squeezin' their trigger fingers at me
So I would go to school and try to get good grades
Teacher wrote mommy and kicked me outta school for havin' braids
So she cussed them, said "My son ain't no motherfuckin' hoodlum"
They judged us, thinking that we dumb cause where we come from
Got a little older and now I see
Young niggas wanted by the powers that be (powers that be)

[Hook: Emily]
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?
For these wars we're fighting with each other
Season after season
When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'
What's the reason?

[Verse 2: Nas]
Uh, picture a Black nanny and a baby in a basket pushin' down 5th Ave
She never had it, it's not hers to begin with
She gives it breakfast, baths and dinners
Treats it so tender while her own kids live alone at home with no phone on
Ain't had a good meal in so long, but so long as mommy's a maid
Cookin' and cleanin', she wanna feed her kids and her kids are dreamin'
Where's my daddy, who's my daddy, have you seen him?
I could imagine them askin', what type of human be-ing
Could leave his family, go back to the Carribean?
Was he locked up, shot up, does he have freedom?
Mom said wipe your tears, keep readin'
But daddy's somewhere, spirit broken, feelin' defeated
A man feels he has to conquer all
The world is his oyster, his pearl so y'all know

[Hook: Emily]
I can't find no reason why we can't all live in peace
Cause this world keeps spinning, yet still I wonder what's the reason

I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
When you're workin' hard but there ain't nothin' comin'
What's the reason?
Oooh-whoa-ooh-whoa

[Verse 3: Nas]
I know a girl, her boyfriend was a fugitive
She's intuitive, be on some stupid shit
She called the cops cause she hated his mother
Now he away doin' numbers, now she gay with her lover
How many niggas gon' die this summer?
I pump life in my music, but still life is a wonder
There's a officer in a squad car, he's a prostitute serial killer
It's odd, huh? Cause he's the same cop in church with his wife
He's molestin' his son and she ignores it at night
Little bad ass bastard, lights a match and kills Betty Shabazz
In her pad while she slept
They said Prescott Bush funded Hitler while the world's in a twister
Nigga, what you expect? Imagine what's next

[Hook: Emily]

Emily harmonizes as Nas talks:
"Uh, uh, man, man'll search the whole planet, looking for what
Try to conquer all. So what? To all my niggas with they
Kids that love they kids, man. All the daddies out there
To all the niggas that died tryin'a figure out what's what
Tryin'a be the biggest of the big, you know. Yeah, yeah
Ladies forgive us. Gotta forgive us. For we know not what
We do. Breakin' hearts, leavin' the crib, buggin' out and
Shit. Just man... man."



[Nas]
I think I can remember some...

[Verse 1]
Brenda the back-bender used to have me in the twister
Grabbed her up and left her at the Buena Vista
Chelsea used to tell me choke her while I stroke her
Stuck a Heineken bottle up in the ass, a real joker
Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick
Nasty though, she used to try to eat my excrement
Used to play Atari 1200, baby-sitter made me kiss her
Put hickeys on her stomach
Toya was a tomboy 'til we played catch and screw
Had her out past her curfew, Sheila had this perfume
That drove a nigga wild, was a child then, Gertrude
Used to put my face in her crotch
Spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched
Eiserea knew I was a player, brought Fatima, loud screamer
While I blew clouds of reefer, they sucked juice out my uretha
While Marvin Gaye pumped from the speaker

[Hook]
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
Remember the times I fucked a few
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
And all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
Remember the times I fucked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind
But none of them could touch you

[Verse 2]
Was only scared of them STDs, syphilis, VD and herpes
Daffy Duck-lookin' bitch burnt me, correction
Urinary tract infection, what I got for no protection
Was a horny dog, mornings waking up with a log
Dick stuck to my draws, wet dreams in the mind
Of a one-of-a-kind sex fiend, Justine was luscious wanna cuff us when fucked us
Me and her best friend, this thick Texan named Tamika, English teacher
Wedding ring on finger, bent her big ass over the fold-out sofa
The weather was cold and Loretta would throw on nothing but a thong
Under the coat and
Put a show on just to show me she loved me
She would undress and wait in zero below weather
In slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive
Kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap, the steering wheel's high

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Thank God I got bank god, so fuck pimpin'
Fuck broke condoms, pills and penicillin
Abortion clinics, I was one of the best who did it
Lesbian shit, wheelchair girls and midgets
Twin sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters, some wasn't no quarters
Long chin, some with funny odors
Long blond weaves, overweight, cottage cheese
Some I paid college fees, then they strip tease
And it's sad I don't remember great times that made me drool
And the sex gave me flashbacks when I was like eww
Mature with it now dog, here's the side of Nas
Principles are lined up, things prioritized
Se mamma I left that alone, faded memories, the reason that I'm grown
It'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences, no longer
Are we tempted

[Hook]



[Nas]
Alright, are you sure

[Kelis]
Yeah, I'm sure
So wait, you're telling me there's no-
You can't think of anybody
In your past, in your dirty dark crazy past (Nas laugh)
So if I gave you a free pass, you wouldn't wanna do them just one last time

[Nas]
No

[Kelis]
Come on

[Nas]
No

[Kelis]
I don't believe you, all them-
All them bitches?
I'm serious, okay I'm saying you have
Before we get married you have one free pass
I don't need to know about it

[Nas]
Mhm...

[Kelis]
But it's one girl, there's one girl that you had in the past that you could say
"You know what? Let me hit that one more time"

[Nas]
Ah, I can't really think of nobody
Definitely ain't nobody 'cause I've been there, done that
You know, let me go through it



[Nas]
I think I can remember some...

Brenda the back-bender used to have me in the twister
Grabbed her up and left her at the Buena Vista
Chelsea used to tell me choke her while I stroke her
Stuck a Heineken bottle up in the ass, a real joker
Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick
Mad skills, she used to try to eat my excrement
Used to play Atari 1200, baby-sitter made me kiss her
Put hickeys on her stomach
Toya was a tomboy 'til we played catch a screw
Had her out past her curfew, Sheila had this perfume

Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you

[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

[Verse 1]
Straight up, shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers, we all stare
At the out-of-towners
(Ay, yo, yo, who that?), they better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers
Homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock
For the fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a TEC out the dresser; police got me under pressure

[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

[Verse 2]
Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Mot drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's

[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

[Verse 3]
No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard, God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Bokeem, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs
'Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, one love

[Chorus]
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent

[Outro]
One time for your mothafuckin' mind
This goes out to everybody in New York
That's living the real fucking life and every projects, all over
To my man Big Will, he's still here
The 40 side of Vernon, my man Big L.E.S
Big Cee-Lo from the Don, Shawn Penn, the 40 busters
My crew the shorty busters, the 41st side of Vernon posse

Crazy barrio spot, (Big Dove), we rock shit a lot, PHD
And my man Premo from Gang Starr

Fuck y'all crab-ass niggas though!

Bitch ass niggas! Bitch ass niggas!
Young bitch ass motherfuckers!

Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxxane
I used to chill on the corner, on the block
Every day's a different...that had us running from cops

We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks

Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The rest of my life
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh)
The rest of my life

[Verse 1: Nas]
Life: dead presidents, devilish men
Overthrow king from they thrones cause of their negligence
Death, real shit'll start comin' to light
Niggas you ain't like dickin' your wife, what?
Kind of undermining, grimy, stiff corpse shapin'
Pork bacon, double-cross Satan
Heathens, non-god-fearing, lace thong wearing demons
But glory go to God, y'all beneath him
If y'all don't know that, rap with a old cat
He'll show you streets where them big dealers drove at
Where low-key killers let the fo' clap
Blocka-blocka-blockaoh
The glow, the 'dro, the dough for shows
Everything a hood brother think he needsyo
You'll find a goal in a ghetto superstar's roadmap
And I'mma use that for the

[Chorus: Amerie]
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The rest of my life
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The rest of my life

[Verse 2: Nas]
Burnt-out, kicked to the curb
So I had to learn how to turn around a hundred thou' real fast
In '95 that was my last, I went back to the ave thinkin' rap's a thing of the past
Rest in peace E Money Bags, no more cabs, got caught with the ratchet in the stash
Lawyer want cash, my ba'y bro blast burners at cats who gel
They burnt a range with a Molotov cokctail
My little man got fourteen-years for car-jackin' a undercover
Them cops swear, my little nigga told on me
I'm thinkin, "Hello, where's the L-O-V-E"
Pigs play games, my little man'll never say names
Word to his pops with elephant veins
They both locked-up still, word to Will
I'll make it and chill for the

[Chorus: Amerie]
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The rest of my life
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3: Nas]
My man gave his mommy coke
So she wouldn't hit the block all crazy for the smoke
Damn, nigga, could you picture you supplyin' your own moms
So she don't have to bone for dimes?
Or give dome for nicks' in the roofs of the projects
Where dogs shit and piss
Yeah, we all plan to get rich but it's all about how it's executed
Lexus coup-ed, brigettes from cubics
Might've been stupid, but I got far from twenty-six bars
To ten LPs
What can him tell me? Of them? Of y'all?
I'm Nason a track that's unorthodox
Like my life could've been offed by the cops
Told y'all, Nas will prevail by the book when it's up for sale
About the rest

Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Intro: Nas & (Lake)]
(Uh uh huh, lets go, yeah!)
Uh, ghetto children singing (singing, what up?)
See they eager to learn (uh hum)
How to become the next world leaders, Bravehearts

[Chorus: Nas]
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here

[Verse 1: Nas]
Book one, strategy, tactics, techniques
Look dumb, but massively notice the weakness
In all them, gotta shoot only if necessary
Homie vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal
Beware the thugs who ain't scared of blood or jail time
When Aryan nations ain't having integration
We so blind, the beauty of life
Was when my mom said nigga you could be Christ
I wasn't old enough to hold my dick and pee right
"Jesus", what is he like?
I picture him standing with diamonds on him
Little different from the way my mommy saw him
Practice your aiming, physical training in difficult terrain and
Test your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging
Splitting dutches up, strap up
The armies is school teaching smart ways to kill
I'm thinking Gandhi was a fool, the chronic's a fool
Got me thinking out loud, fuck it
Sleep on my drunkenness I'll blow your brains out

[Chorus: Nas]
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here

[Verse 2: Lake]
My revolution is as real as Bobby Seale's
I build with dudes and cribs worth a quarter mill in Dix Hills
For fishscale, to cop guns, the time come
I'll mask up and get my comrade off the bus
Fuck the beef, I'll snatch your seed from Chuckie Cheese
And feed him to the rats in the back of the P's
Black fatigues and AR-15s on the sofa
50 inch flat screen, Louie Vuitton holsters
My motions don't appeal to appellate divisions
I did it strong for 7 long years in prison, fuck the system
I'm like a modern day Hitler
Black gorilla, Crip and Blood in one nigga
Only killers know my face
I beat a case for shooting at the police, nigga, the name Lake
Though simultaneously the street revolution
21 gun salute the new Huey Newton

[Chorus: Nas]
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here

[Verse 3: Nas & Lake]
Teach y'all women how to hold the family down in case something happens to it's fathers
Protect the children, grab revolvers
The women plays important part of our life force
So what we fight for, my heart goes to you, beautiful wife in war
Uh, and listen more and talk less
Watch all and trust none, demand your respect
And be ready to die for what you believe in
And ride all the time not just when convenient
Justice and freedom, wisdom and understanding
We the lost children of Israel in this western world region
You ain't a man, you a coward if you can't support the girl you put a seed in
Strong rule the weak, but the wise rule the strong
It's more to a war than just getting it on
Conceal your form, cover your tracks, stay prepared
I don't care if no one's spared in..

[Chorus: Nas]
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here



[Verse]
Listen up, gangstas and honies with your hair done
Pull up a chair, hon', and put it in the air, son
Dogwhatever they call youGod, just listen
I spit a story backwardsit starts at the endin'
The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet holes close in the chest of this nigga
Now he back to square one, screamin', "shoot don't please"
I put my fifth back on my hip, it's like a VCR rewindin' a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch, my caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van and closed it shut
Goin' reverse, slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out somethin' crazy like, "go he there"
Sittin' in back of this chair, we hittin' the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt
The blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinnin' records backwards of AC/DC
I give my niggas dap, jump out the van, back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, "outside right we"
So with my mouth wide, holdin' my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for you
'Cause Jungle said, "block your on enemy's the"
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang
I'm laid in the bed, thinkin' about this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, "no hell," she talkin' about, "me kiss"
Bobbed her head then spit a nut back in my dick
Started suckin' with no hands, a whole lot of spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, "stressed really I'm"
Picked up her Gucci bag and left a nigga behind
Walkin' through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three to two to one
And that's about the time the story begun
That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said: "Son, we found that nigga we gotta kill."

[Outro]
*Beep*
Ayo son, ayo son, you hear me, you hear me?
Listen, man, this dude right on the block
Right now, man, I found him, right now
I see him right now, let's kill him!
*Beep*
"Yo, this Nas, leave it: peace."



[Intro]
Uh, yeah turn it up, check it out

[Verse 1]
The transition from a young fool
Broke, still on his neck, he hung jewels
Live his life in the ghetto where guns rule
It was cool wasn't mad, I had to take out cabs
Made my first LP afforded H-Class, my face gassed
'94, Sold out in every record store
Local hood rats who wouldn't speak
Now I'm who they're checking for
Shown crazy love, ran up on stage with 80 thugs
After the shows, my niggas robbed the bar and wrecked the clubs
Happy, no hating, more henny, more blunts circulating
My single in rotation on every radio station
Eyes popped when I drove my first ride on the block
Summertime, block parties, cookouts, I spend my knot
Truly, niggas was fighting over who was closely to me
Happy with the new representative of QB
To hit the top first you have to gotta fall before you make it
With for 4 minutes of your time, watch me demonstrate it

[Verse 2]
Cayman Islands in the winter, summer bus rides to Great Adventure
I've brung New York back to real rap inventors
New crib, diamond rings, killers on my team
Infinitis for my girl for giving birth to my queen
3 g's worth of chronic a week, promoters were mad
I stopped doing shows to spend time in the street
Loot declined, eventually so did my shine
Repo looking for my Lex, back then I wasn't buying
You can guess niggas started saying, with all the success
"Why is your mom still in the projects?" I answered them vexed
Fuck out my face, pistol in my car, full clip
I read about Pablo Escobar and got on some shit
So called mans would plot on my chips, I was fronting
Niggas thought I was rich and got mad cause they was pumpin'
My assumption, niggas want me pumped in the casket
Kept the gun the same three-fifth a nigga got bagged with

[Verse 3]
Caught a case now, I'm home staring off into space
Flashbacks of all the jewelry, cars, crossing my face
Rappers I met, hoes on video cassette
No management, no more good life and no respect
Hearing crowds roar, crystal pouring mixed drinks
Haunted by the thoughts of second album sophomore jinx
Where did I fail? Death threats, woke up in cold sweats
Thinking about all these murders that know where I rest
From hanging with crazy cliques that's known to take shit
Bracelets, and all that beef now I'm involved, was paperless
My cars were auctioned off, now I catch rides with kidnap-niggas
Who snatch babies up to get back figures
Lessons from heaven, every night I slept with my weapon
To guard my family for a minute I forgot my profession
Not from Columbia or Nicaragua
Don't distribute coke from Antigua, that shipped out to Panama
Pablo Escobar's bloody reign came to an end
Far from my life; a kid who made his fame from a pen
Hit the studio and change the game again
Wrote down all the pain within, top of the charts, triple platinum
Got the fake love back, money stacks, more plaques
Had to see who I was just to know where I was at
Saw both sides of the game, all the ups and downs
This goes out to the future rap kings coming up now

[Hook Slick Rick & Nas]
This was the rise and fall of my fast lane style
(From Nasty to Nas to Nas Escobar)
(Mega popular center of attraction)
I was the main event on the TV for a while
This was the rise and fall of my fast lane style
(From Nasty to Nas to Nas Escobar)
(Mega popular center of attraction)
I was the main event on the TV for a while

[Refrain: Nikki Flores]
Just like a rose
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful
But I feel a thorn on my hide
I should've known
We can't repair what we broke
But I held you close, too close
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't want them no more
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't need them no more

[Verse 1: Nas]
I have no time to give you guidance
Barely have any fuck time either
Hefner minded like I think you're fine, but
I seen the finest women that ever came out a beaver
Mind reader, can tell she vegan or not when I meet her
Or if she insecure, most are
If she's mixed, a possible psycho alert goes off
Not a judge, 'cause a judge don't wear no draws, yet he allows
Everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows
My tax bracket, not enough blacks have it
Who should I date -- Project chick or Cuban actress?
A White chick, they might flip talking that Blackness
Should only attract Black shit, I'm an ass magnet
If you mad at that, you'll be mad forever
Never played you, I prayed we would stay together
Wished it'd last forever, know what I mean
Heard you tear a rose from the roots, the rose screams

[Refrain: Nikki Flores]
Just like a rose
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful
But I feel a thorn on my hide
I should've known
We can't repair what we broke
But I held you close, too close

[Verse 2: Nas]
Them Xanax can't manage your maniac manic depressive expressions
They some silent killers, that stress shit
That put ulcers in a lot of niggas
I'm blowing medical, it helps chill a violent temper
I done went to hell and back, you always think you right
You know when you wrong, and still you want to fight
When people like my song, you want to kill 'em, right?
You resent me every time I make a million, right?
You want to experience life when you calling all the shots
Ordering bottles for all your girls up in the spot
Have your own cash, own your own Benz
Your own house, everything, me I understand
Thought you would bask in the glory as Queen Bee
Put you on under Martin Scorsese: Mean Street
The first movie he made, thought that was fly
I thought you was flyer, you a fucking liar

[Refrain: Nikki Flores]
Just like a rose
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful
But I feel a thorn on my hide
I should've known
We can't repair what we broke
But I held you close, too close
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't want them no more
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't need them no more



[Chorus: RaVaughn]
Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (Wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (Cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (Penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (Poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (No), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us

[Verse 1: Nas]
A known fraud once fell on his own sword
Scrawny as a fiend, he'll tell on his own broad
His lady's crazy and it bugs me
Behind her best friend back, she call her best friend baby ugly
Less then a week ago
He's beatin' his dick to a freak he know
Talkin' dirty to him on speakerphone
Right before he clinked up, his girl creeped up
Swung a knife, hit his cheekbone, made a deep cut
He holdin' his face, he out the door
She yellin' out the window, "You can stay with that whore"
Hours went past, stitched up with the gauze
Gettin' drunk by the store, smokin' blunts with some more
Fraud ass niggas who like to front and big talk
Never swung at nobody, never let a gun spark
Big nine-seven Benz with the old body
Pulls up to the corner, out jumps his old hottie

[Chorus: RaVaughn and Nas]
Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (Wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (Cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (Penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (Poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (No), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty (Nigga)
But they gon' know when they see us (Yo)

[Verse 2: Nas]
Football wives, basketball wives
Mistresses slash more tires with knives
They lookin' for a dollar
I'm lookin' for a JoAnne Chesimard to turn to a shotta
Spot a King of Diamonds, Onyx, one bitch get it off the floor
Other chick out of her man's pockets
What kind of shows you be watchin'?
It shows, this is how we choose who we should rock with
I think about settlin' down again, have more seeds
Ten toes on the ground again, let hoes be
Nothin' like makin' love with somebody you love
Nothin' like comin' home to grub
Netflix, hugs with a wet kiss
The best shit, take my mind off of makin' records
I need that moral support
Give me a reason to spoil you more
Make 'em jealous of who we are

[Chorus: RaVaughn]
Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (Wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (Cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (Penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (Poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (No), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us

[Verse 3: Nas]
Tryna get my niggas legitimate
Shit is ugly, my dudes strugglin', drug dealer shit
Silhouette of a murderer, thug nigga, fitted Mets cap
Drunk liquor bit, young black militant
Just hopin' I hit a lick, a criminal's wit
Intelligence, still a menace each Guinness I sip
Bring the kid ideas, the visions I get
How this dude rich? He snuck in with no citizenship
Motivation, so I get off my ass
I'm the star of the movie, lookin' for my supportin' cast
Read the Forbes pages, lookin' at G4s
Wish it could be more, pray I beat the court cases
Women with small waists, lonely, I ain't too far
Smoke weed, and count paper
I'm about paper and pussy and buyin' the bar
Fly ass niggas, y'all jealous of who we are

[Chorus: RaVaughn]
Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (Wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (Cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (Penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (Poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (No), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us



[Intro: Nas]
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, Nas, uh, yo, yo
Life, they wonder, can they take me under?
Nah, never that, nah, yo, yo

[Verse 1: Nas]
I come from the housing tenement buildings
Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death
Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
Though I owe to it my success
With survival of the fittest, every day is a chal'
I would think I'm a part of U.S.A. and be proud
Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign
Like, the darker you are the realer your problems
I reached for the stars but I just kept slipping
On this life mission, never know what's next
Ancient kings from Egypt, up to Julius Caesar
Had a piece of the globe, every continent
Yo, there's Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan
Pakistan, America, Afghanstan
Yo, there's Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics
Call a truce, world peace, stop actin like savages
No war, we should take time and think
The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
But since the beginning of time it's been men with arms fighting
Lost lives in the Towers and Pentagon, why then
Must it go on? we must stop the killing
Tell me why we die, we all God's children

[Chorus: Nas and Amerie]
All this hate can't last forever (uh, c'mon)
It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon)
World (peace), world (peace), world (peace), world

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo, there's brothers on the block, posted up like they own it
That's they corner, from New York to California
Got blocks locked down
Like, "dog you safe whenever you with me, see this is my town"
So the youngsters, grows in ghettos, goes to prison
At an early age, already know it's against him
So in order for him to survive, one day he must open up his eyes
To the set backs and rise
Cause, everybody wants a shot, in this land of opportunity
Look at what this country's got
There shouldn't be nobody homeless
How can the president fix other problems when he ain't fixed home yet
The earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone
To all colors and creeds, to home it belongs
I want land, mansions, banks and gold
The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control
The world's natural resources, all its residuals
But then comes foes, I have to guard it with missiles
And I become the most wanted
But is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by Secret Service?
I guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels
So move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel, yo

[Chorus: Nas and Amerie]
All this hate can't last forever (uh, c'mon)
It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon)
World (peace), world (peace), world (peace), world

[Verse 3: Nas]
Y'all know that's my style, to hit you at the right time
No other compares to what Nas write down
Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours
You could get what you love, be a chain in cause
You alive right now
There's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast, I'm a highlight now
It's whatever man think of manifest to the real
The plan is to wake up cause time reveals
All this hate can't forever last
All my ghetto heroes in Heaven, it's like you right here and never passed
You just transcend, I know I'm gon' see you again
Hoping I reach the world leaders and win
Ain't nothing without struggle, listen up, it's critical
We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical
In Hip-Hop, the weapons are lyrical
To be the best you challenge the best, then the blessings are spiritual
Top of the world for the kid, none less
Poppin' any rapper's head off his shoulders no contest
I know the Most High hear me, so fly you can't near me
You scared of a mirror, my theory is that - knowledge is power
To every projects and every street corner, we gotta get ours now

[Chorus: Nas and Amerie]
All this hate can't last forever (uh, c'mon)
It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon)
World (peace), world (peace), world (peace), world

[Outro: Skit]
Yo, niggas ain't forget shit, know what I'm saying?
Niggas ain't forget nothing
Men, women and children killed by the police and shit
Niggas ain't gon' forget that man, you know what I mean?
Yo, what this war just show me is like
Whatever you want out of life
Whatever you feel is rightfully yours, go out and take it
Even if that means blood and death
You know, that's what I was raised up on
That's what this country's about
This is, this is what my country is, and my country's a motherfucker



In a day of 1999 it had to happen
The result of man's stupidity became real
Death smell is everywhere
In their nicely worked out war plan
Through the sky come rockets down there people are scored
Everybody does try to save his own everywhere in town
On the run the people turn to animals
Love and hate does not exist here more
No more hope
Which led to the world's last breath
Fire does control our world till the end
Go fight stand up if you are not scared
Tell them the people are dead
The merciless radioactivity spread real fast
Burning skin makes the pain a torture, everybody gets blind
Can't feel hot and cold no more, it is so strange
Listen to the people helpless screams, it is too late
Moving forward slowly and together we are strong
We will tell them what we are thinking
About their bloody war
And we stop the war and there will be no hate
And we will together rule the world peacefully



[Intro: Swizz Beatz & Nas]
Yo man, it's a real game out here man
Know what I'm sayin' Nas?
Beats back in effect man
Swizz Beatz da monsta' (what's poppin'?)
Get in line, everybody get in line
Listen the fuck up, to what's going down
Pay attention, aight?

[Hook: Nas]
Niggas salute me, bitches salute me
The block salute me, the hood salute me
You should salute me, they should salute me
So fuck who you are

Niggas salute me, bitches salute me
The block salute me, the hood salute me
You should salute me, they should salute me
So fuck who you are

[Nas: Verse 1]
When I walk through everything stops, silence
Remain quiet, babies don't cry thugs don't buss
Cops cut off sirens, oxygen freeze
Noises to a minimun nigga, I pop and I squeeze
I represent the pain and struggle
Cut out your eyeballs then brain-fuck you
Yo you testin with death
I'm confronting the justice, expressing my voice to the public
They got to free some brothas or we kidnap the judges
They got to free some sistas or we kidnap the judges
They got to beat the system that's enslaving the poor
Our practicing, gun rages, they R's and .44's
Many fought teams and for green this is war
This is life and I'm the hardest, got ya label all scared
Callin up the radio, don't want my records to air
Y'all ain't playin fair, to every rapper in the game
I'm comin fo y'all blood, make room for the king...Nas

[Hook: Nas]
Niggas salute me, bitches salute me
The block salute me, the hood salute me
You should salute me, they should salute me
So fuck who you are

Niggas salute me, bitches salute me
The block salute me, the hood salute me
You should salute me, they should salute me
So fuck who you are

[Nas: Verse 2]
I'm the leader, that's it, nobody higher
Nobody touchin' my crown, nobody dyin'
Nobody smoother, harder, tougher, believe it
I'm much more smarter, much more strategic
Scholarships and hollow tips, a lot of walkin' caskets
They talk a good one but there's never no action
And I'm the type to poison ya sista, twist her
Through wit' her put the gun in your face and make you hit her
Make you quiver -when they silhouette of a Don, Benson
Light up a Cu-ban, recite a few psalms
Enlighten you quick, teach you how a king wins wars
Keep your ears to the street, love your enemies more
'Cuz hate can frustrate, and confuse
Too eager you lose, patience, plan your attack then you move - ghetto
Green Berets, got freaks got hoes
Who be jumpin' out of movin' cars and land at my feet - because

[Hook: Nas]
Niggas salute me, bitches salute me
The block salute me, the hood salute me
You should salute me, they should salute me
So fuck who you are
I'm the motherfuckin' general
Niggas salute me, bitches salute me
The block salute me, the hood salute me
You should salute me, they should salute me
So fuck who you are
I'm the motherfuckin' general

[Outro: Nas]
Uh, Nas

Last year I had to smack niggas up
And this year imma have to smack a whole lot of muh'fucka's up again
Know why?
Cause I'm the motherfuckin' general
Ya'll niggas see it, it's all in the streets
Ya man know it, ya girl know it
Ya moms know it, ya pops know it, the world know it
The motherfuckin' general
Get high, get ya drink on, relax
Why? Cause I'm the motherfuckin' general



"Watch Out"----8X

[Nas]
There's a man who live the life of danger
To everyone he meets stays as stranger
With every move he makes, another chance he takes
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow

He's secret agent man, amazing man
Check how he walks, how he talks, how he lays his plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They give you a number then take away your name

Secret agent man, amazing man
Check how he walks how he talks how he lays the plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They give you a number then take away your name

Beware of pretty faces that you find
A pretty face can hide an evil mind
Be careful what you say, or you'll give yourself away
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow
Agent man, amazing man
Check how he walks, how he talks, how he lays his plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They gave him a number and took away his name

Secret agent man, amazing man
Check how he walks, how he talks, how he lays his plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They give you a number then take away your name

Swinging in the Riviera one day
Then laying in the Bombay alley the next day
Oh no, who let the wrong word slip
While kissing them persuasive lips
The odds are I won't live to see tomorrow
I'm secret agent man, amazing man
How I walk and talk and lays my plan
Agent man advance the game
They give you a number then take your name
He's the, agent man, amazing man

"Watch Out" ---6X

Uh, secret agent man
Uh, uh, more bullet proof than a spook of set by the door
More legend than 007, more raw

"Watch Out" ---4X



[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh, I knew a few pharmacists, fuck frozen
They kept pneumonias on their arms and wrists
The main dude, Sekou, face look hard as shit
Remember like yesterday, they were the kings of ecstacy
Kept sellin' it, he blends in everywhere, has a mixed heritage
Bitches let him hit on the reg', waterbed seats in his car
All red Ferrari, Florida where we met at a redlight
Homeboy bumpin' my old shit
They wildin' with some freaks from the islands
Piled in behind him, limosine, Benz
He shouted, "Nas, roll with us"
I'm bored so I followed him
Nikki Beach, here's where the scene begins
He put me on to Dawn, nice ass with a set of mean twins
Had a pocket full of cash, Sekou wasn't lettin' me spend
I was there for the weekend, packed and prepared for anything
Then he brings me to his castle in Coconut Grove
War stories about dudes both of us know
Never heard drunken words spoken so slow
A year go by, the nigga was fly
Prada shoes, a lotta jewelry, stayed high
Got a call, he's in N.Y
Needs a couple of G's 'til tomorrow, I dips by
For a season where he's at
Greets me with a smile, told him "Here keep that"
Next week got a call from his wife
Said somebody done took son life
*beat changes*
She said

[Nas as Scarlett - repeat 2X]
"Who gon' hold me down now? Hold me down now
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now?
Who gon' hold me down now? Who gon' hold me down?
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now"

[Nas as Scarlett]
Forget about them other dudes, they talkin' to me rude
Cause I always knew the truth, they hated Sekou
H2 full of holes, the drove him off the road
Left him there on Biscayne, clothes stained with his brain
My soul shattered, my man's toe's tagged up
Arrangement's a closed casket
See now a ho has to, maintain with his fake gang
Sheddin' fake tears, I won't have it
Look, this kid's Jamaican -- half Hatian, half Asian
Brag about how the streets needed a changin'
Son, you the only one a bitch could call
You remind me of my dude, help me get them all

Nas: "Di-sci-ple" *scratched by DJ 3X*
Scarlett: "You remind me of my dude, help me get them all"
Nas: "Di-sci-ple" *scratched by DJ 3X*
Scarlett: "You remind me of my dude, help me get them all"



[Nas (Akon)]
Shakedown (Uh-oh-oh); Akon, Nas, here we go New York
(Uh-oh-oh) Here we go world, here we go y'all
(Uh-oh-oh, Cause it's a shakedown, uh-oh-oh)

[Ali Vegas]
The streets'll do whatever just to see me fail
Mama'll do whatever to keep free from jail
So she tellin' me to get my CDL
But papi said he got some things that we could sell
To turn the corner and to see VVS's
He said you liked girls to get beneath their dresses
You gon' need them SS's, VVS's, BBS's
Here go the keys to the Lexus (Uh-oh-oh)
Now I'm the center of attention like Kareem and them
My squad run around the borough like we Prem' and them
My gang with big truck, wifey's we beamin' them
Let's Esco, that tag team from Queens again
This is Shakedown, here go the breakdown
The big boys are back; 'lil niggas get off the playground
I got up with the homey A now
The kid babies 'bout to make the Earth quake now

[Hook: Akon (Nas)]
Uh-oh-oh, we back now
A bunch of gangsters strapped so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats you know the lay down (Lay it down)
And give 'em all you got, cause it's a shakedown (Shakedown)
Uh-oh-oh, (New York to H-Town)
We back now (Here we go y'all)
A bunch of gangsters strapped so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats you know the lay down
(Uh-oh, Nas and Akon, uh-oh, Nas and Akon)
And give 'em all you got, cause it's a shakedown
Uh-oh-oh, (Here we go)

[Nas]
My man was smart
Robbed the bank, buried the cash
Did ten years, came home and bought him a Jag
Other side of town, stick-up kids ride around
Young niggas not prepared this time around
Walk in the jewelry store yellin', "Get on the floor"
Snatched the sales lady up, hit her with the bulldog
Grabbin' the ice, the heist went fast as the Vice
Had rushed in, bussin', could you imagine this life?
The streets come alive and laugh at your sorrows
Leavin' your soul hollow
That you fill it back up liquor bottles
Black Messiah had the jux, 20 ki's uncooked
Easy to push, some Japanese dealers were crooks
They leave niggas eyes cut out; what it means to us
He seen too much, but we don't give a fuck
Black truck pull up to the door
Infa-green night vision lens we can see through the war
"Get on the floor"

[Hook: Akon]
We back now
A bunch of gangsters strapped so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats you know the lay down
And give 'em all you got, cause it's a shakedown
Uh-oh-oh
Do I make myself clear, uh-oh-oh



[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Hook:]
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
They wanna shine on 'em
Shine on 'em
Shine on 'em

[Verse 1:]
Yea, they dug me out the soil and the mines of the motherland
Now I'm displaced, one hand to another hand
Illegal smugglin', people strugglin'
Wish they could just throw me back in the mud again
Yea, guess that's how we got here, slave trade and the diamond trade
Every childs afraid when his mother and father get sprayed
Forced in the army, young killer brigade
Get's a new name, then he gets his nose glued
Till his mind can't take what he's going through
Lookin' in the dirt for that ice so blue
Then the royal family the ice go to
And this thing has to change, feelin' half ashamed
As I rap with my platinum chain
When you shop for me you think about the misery?
The same way we made apartheid history
We can do the same way to the conflict ice
But everybody wanna shine right?

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
My VVS glimmers on my chest, 200 thou encrusted watch on my wrist
I wonder how how people starve to death, when God blessed the land that lacks the harvest
The stones are quality, but their homes are poverty
And the whole world ignores the robbery
Bought my girl pretty rocks, but she mad at me
Tear drop shape, ugh, perfect clarity
It shocks so many are killed annually
Cause of greed, lust, and pure vanity
Stop talkin' and do somethin' about it
Every holiday season, jewelry stores crowded
Kids snatched from they homes, mutilated alive
Husbands separated from wives
Keep a Jesus Piece to be fly
But there was a time back in the day when they called that shine

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
Incomprehensible singing



[Verse 1]
One .44, two .45's
Three loaded clips, four niggas roll, one nigga drives
Five hundred Benz, six reasons why this kid should die
We shooting every mothafucka outside
Pulled on his block, jumped out the car
Guns in our hand, at the same time everybody ran
There that nigga go, hiding in the crowd
Let the trigger blow, seven shots now he lying on the ground
Blood on the floor then we shot some more
Niggas he was with two niggas hit, one nigga fell
One tried to run, go get him son
Make sure he's done 'fore we bail, I ain't tryna go to jail
Must handle beef, code of the street, load up the heat
If these nigga think they could fuck around
Real niggas do real things by all means
Niggas knowing how we get down, it goes

[Chorus]
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?
(Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder)
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?
(Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder)
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?
(Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder)

[Verse 2]
Driving through roads, Suburban Chevrolet
Six tinted windows, and I'm on my way
To get up with my hoes, I pull up to they house
Not a freak to be heard, nobody came out
Ringing the bell, where in the hell, could they be at?
I'm about to leave stepping slow, where my truck was at
Who the fuck is that? Could it be a jack?
Now pull my strap, it's my man and we have the same plan
There them bitches go, Civic '94
Looking funny though, open up the car door, funny smile
Fuck two already, third ass was heavy
"Nas this is Sherry, Sherry this is Nas and his man, ready?"
Walked in the house, snatched off they clothes
Ran through them hoes, plenty ice, that they all seemed to like
Can't find my man, heard a blam-blam
Now I'm wondering, "In this scam, do I even stand a chance?"
He killed the hoes, took all they dough
Fire in his eyes, higher than the sky coming down the stairs
Now he wanting mine, reaching for my nine
Aiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time
My nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering
"Put your gun down, we can skip town"
Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat
Lift off his chain, took his shit, emptied out close range

[Chorus]
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?
(Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder)
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?
(Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder)
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?
(Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder)

[Verse 1]
Yo, release what's in me
Besides the Henny, it's eyes that's seen plenty
Fiends get skinny as if Queens was a Craig Jenny
Instead of diet plans it's crack 200 grams
I pump a G-pack, peeping for where the D's at
It's slow, lookin' for Rambo, the cop who got grazed
Back in the days, chasin' niggas through my project maze
That cop he got a death wish
He run behind niggas until you breathless
Everyday he makin' ten arrests, shit!
My nigga check this, I know the bitch he rest with
I even blessed it, forty-dash-ten inspect it
(Already checked it Dunn, near his ankle you could see his gun)
Peep, he parked his Jeep in the back of the slum
To check Tanisha, fat ass real fly, with the blonde caesar
Vittadini summer gear, she push the two-seater
I heard she brag about the way he eat her
A Irish man short slim with a tan, they say he laced her cheeba
She due, be lookin' weaker, now her teeth are foul
Speakin' loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud
Fat ass dissolvin', like cotton candy in a mouth that's starvin'
Rock the same gear daily, like a soldier in my squadron
I heard she let Jake investigate from her window
Cause she's a nympho, suckin' dick and coughin' up info
So now it's set up, her and the beast to get wet up
I know he vest up, we blazin' from the neck up
(Yo let me knock first) Soon as he open let your Gi-Glock burst
They had the chains on, son hit the lock first
We busted in the cop jerked, Jungle popped one in his shirt
I grabbed the bitch by her tits, she tried to say she Earth
We saw the cameras, tape recorders, and the monitors
They eyein' us, (Nas yo he survived one from the fo'-five)
Pull his shades down, they seen his last days now
There's no way now, we can be treated just like a slave now
Two in the dome, he's laid down
Ayo the bitch is saved now
She's livin' in a snitch grave now

[Chorus]
Shootouts is similar to Wild West
Broad daylight, face to face without a vest
You know the episodes, thugs camouflage the spectacles
Please God just save the life that the Devil sold
See It Was Written but was never told
Peep the jewels black man, it's even better than gold
Niggas roll with iron, police roll in hot pursuit
Tryin' to stop the loot, fuck Jake, cock and shoot

[Verse 2]
Still on the streets with my peeps so deep
We threw a block party for my man goin' up creek
To do his two to four
Niggas show love, from all around the board
Peace Lord
Sony Handy-Cam on record
Pop a bottle, cause when you come home we still got it sewn
We can watch the tape play back and just zone
Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions
We block the streets off, only crew cars can enter
Music was loud and it was crowded
Barbecued wings we fed the fiends (gamble in the back) Killa shouted
And Frank tried to stop the bank, lost about what a Roley cost
Guzzled his drink, and staggered off
He's a Big Will, used to slang krill, now he own The Hill
Couldn't take losin' his cash, and I could feel
Somethin' in the air yeah
Frank returned with Pierre
A gun slinger, who niggas hadn't seen in a year
I usually be holdin' - 'specially this type of weekend
And everyone except for me had started reachin'
They had gats in each others faces, with kids
And grandmothers around, Frank's only concern was his paper
My man Killa let off, half of them fake niggas jet off
Police blitz quick, waitin' for that to set off
Runnin' the static, it got me mad cause they a bunch of faggots
Startin' shit in my hood, I can't have it
Yo High, get the 40-Cali stainless, Jake is still out
Let's make it real and still make them niggas famous
Dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze, dodge and weave
Hearin' Jake retaliatin', and Wiz was up the alley waitin'
We breeze, jump in the ride, heard Pierre died
Internal bleedin' inside, and ain't been back since ninety-five

[Chorus]
Shootouts is similar to Wild West
Broad daylight, face to face without a vest
You know the episodes, thugs camouflage the spectacles
Please God just save the life that the Devil sold
See It Was Written but was never told
Peep the jewels black man, it's even better than gold
Niggas roll with iron, police roll in hot pursuit
Tryin' to stop the loot, fuck Jake, cock and shoot

[Chorus]
{*whispered*}
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder

[Verse 1]
It's sort of like the conclusion to Color Purple
Niggas is losing, confusion, with one-time on pursuit moves in
Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit
Cop versus the block, shorties is schooled quick
Lesson number one: If you're arrested and hung
Where niggas is from, gotta keep a lid on your tongue
It's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer
The violent words of a Prince in a Palace of Persia
The cognac plurger plus the trees
But who's the foul one to make his nose take a freeze?
And got enough gall to rock ice in all hype
Used to be a general but just lost his stripe
Pipe dreams and white fiends and all-nighters
Collect calls from lifers, Astoria wars with Cypress
Since I got a problem with the law-writers
I kick some more items just to explore horizons
The palm lady dreamt of this day
So I'mma play the crib close, smokin' with the big toast and lay

[Chorus]
{*whispered*}
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder

[Verse 2]
They say the arms of Nicky Barnes would be enough to blast
A lot of rich niggas fell and started pumping gas
Was it the mind of CIA that bumped off Malik Shabazz?
Fuck what they teach in class, I'mma reach the mass
Strap up, no back up, it's jungle tactics
Living practice, out of line niggas get smacked backwards
So wear it if the cap fits, folded up money and mad clips
Are stacked right under my mattress
To smoke a nigga like a Hughes Brothers motion picture
Niggas getting open, crews roping older niggas
April fools, they laugh, the jokes on the benches
Seeds outside, my nigga spoke on his sentence

[Chorus]
{*whispered*}
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder

[Verse 3]
My right-handers never play too close to cameras
It's night time, scandalous, circle the loud gamblers
Peace-making niggas pep talk
The Beast making niggas walk off the hot avenues with they brew
Time to get this loot countless
'Cause, son, it ain't no youth fountains
Niggas take cash and shoot, bounce and
Pakistanians are took hostage
Locked up inside a linen closet, known for spending pies up
What's the flavor when your neighbors do jake favors?
Locking real niggas down and letting fake players
Roam around the projects, it's lyrical logic
I dilute, the weak can inject the right composite
When plotting on murderous schemes
It seems I'm ghostly called by the essence of Queens
The palm lady dreamt of this day
So I'mma play the crib close, smokin' with the big toast and lay

[Chorus]
{*whispered*}
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder

[Outro]
And Cain killed his brother Abel
When God accepted Abel's offering and not his
Abel's offering showed that Cain was not giving his best to God
And Cain's jealous anger drove him to murder
Drove him to murder



[Intro: Justin Vernon sample]
And I know where I'm going to

[Verse 1: Nas]
I'm lookin' in Longevity's eyes
I play with Infinity's mind, Forever's my guy
My pedigree, above your ass, you'll never see I
I love the past, but see where I'm goin', I get to fly
Never sold a record for the beat, it's my verses they purchase
Without production I'm worthless
But I'm more than the surface
Want me to sound like every song on the Top 40
I'm not for you, you not for me, you bore me
I drop lines prestigious schools read to their students
Look at my album plaques, somebody agrees with the music
Was lovin' women you'll never see
All you know's my kids' mothers, some celebrities
Damn, look at the jealousy!
Lucky me, I meet some beauties
Make you wanna shoot me
Hate to brag, my worst batch kills off your best cutie
Facts is deep, we break up, they hook up with athletes
Get married 'cause we wasn't that match, my G
Don't attach me to the games, I'm lucky, I'm blessed
One of my exes could be your next, dogtrust me, don't test

[Chorus: Nas]
It's the simple things in life, simple things in life
Simple things in life, simple things in life
It's the simple things in life, simple things in life
Simple things in life, simple things in life

[Verse 2: Nas]
Rollin' dice, throw no aces
With my gangsters, we discussin' buyin' acres
Other safe bets, nothin' regular or basic
Ridin' back to back, me and Jungle in some spaceships
Where the squad at?
You can see us on the ave, chop it up as always
Stand up Queensbridge, now the world know us
Everybody sayin' my humility's infectious
I just want my kids to have the same peace I'm blessed with



Situations I be kickin' just you get you pacin'
That attentive parental supervision, you should do the diction
Street chronicles, struggles and losses
Can make a nigga's moms hang up crosses and horseshoes
I brought you to that state of mind you needed
By now you're weeded, bob your head, recline seated
And put your life inside the shoes of the shiestiest crews
With sports cars and the iciest jewels
Y'all know the rules in this street life
By now the beasts might be least white
Stash your heat right, my pop passed the peace pipe
And shed light on, he put me right on
To be an icon, cuz dead niggas got they name wrote up in krylon
The fast life, fistfights, that shit could like amuse me
Some chose a road, some niggas diedso what's to choosing?
At nighttime it especially addresses me
Preferably around 10 when my weed cipher begin
We start buggin' on facts, half the facts, that's for sure
Put your zone in my world if we adapt, crack and pour
Make a toast, yo that's how we break bread together
Probably when we dead be better, the problems ahead whatever
Courvoisier sippin', whippin' out-of-state missions
And just in case you're snitchin', the safe's hidden
With these connivin' things, niggas make it to obvs to bring
Hatred to enterprisin' cream, advise your team to wiser schemes



[Audio sample]

[Verse 1]
The sly Fox, cyclops
We locked in an idiot box
The video slots broadcasting Waco Davidian plots
They own YouTube, MySpace
When this ignorant shit going to stop?
They monopolizing news, your views
And the channel you choose, propaganda, visual cancer
The eye in the sky, number 5 on the dial
Secret agenda, frequency antenna, Dr. Mindbender
Remote control, soul controller, your brain holder
Slave culture, game's over
What's a fox characteristic? Slick shit, censored misinformation
Pimp the station, over-stimulation
Reception, deception, Comcast digital Satan
The fox has a bushy tail
And Bush tells lies and fox-trots
So, I don't know what's real (what's real)

[Chorus]
Watch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins
Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box
And unplug from the Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say, Big Brother is watching
Watch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins
Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box
And unplug from the Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say, Fox Five is watching

[Verse 2]
The Fear Factor got you all riled up
O'Reilly? Oh really? No rally needed, I'll tie you up
Network for child predators, setting them up
MySpace, pimps, hoes and sluts
Y'all exploit rap culture, then y'all flip on us
And you own the Post, and y'all shit on us
What is their net worth?
They're going to try to censor my next verse
Throw them off the roof neck first
While I'm clicking my cursor
Reading blogs about pressure they put on Universal
It gets worse
While I'm clicking my mouse, while they kick in my house
They figured us out, why a nigga go south?
It's either he caught a body
Don't sleep, they're watching
I watch CBS, and I see BS
Trying to track us down with GPS
Make a nigga want to invest in PBS (see BS)

[Chorus]
Watch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins
Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box
And unplug from the Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say, Big Brother is watching
Watch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins
Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box
And unplug from the Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say, Fox Five is watching

[Verse 3]
They say I'm all about murder murder and kill kill
But what about Grindhouse and Kill Bill?
What about Cheney and Halliburton?
The back door deals on oil fields?
How is Nas the most violent person?
Y'all don't know talent if it hit you
Bringing up my criminal possession charges with a pistol
I use Viacom as my firearm
Then let the lyrics split you, who do you rely upon?
Then shoot shells at Leviath-o-n
I'm dealing with the higher form
Fuck if you care of how I write a poem
Only fox that I loved was the Red one
Only black man that Fox love is in jail or a dead one
Red rum, political bedlam
Don't let the hype into your eyes and ear drum
Murdoch owns Fox, not A-Team with Baracus
And he hates Barack cause he march with the marches

[Interlude: Deep voice]
I pledge allegiance to the fair and balanced truth
Not the biased truth
Not the liest truth
But the highest truth
I will not be deceived
Nor will I believe in the propaganda
I will not fall for the okie-doke
I am tuned in...

[Outro]
Watch what they watching
Watch what you're watching
Better watch because they're watching
Watch what you're watching
M-m-media, misleading you
Watch what you're watching

[Intro]
See no evil, fear no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil
If you don't bring that shit around you
You ain't got nothing to worry about (uh-huh)
Yeah (yeah, uh-huh)
Know what I'm saying?
Yo, yo yo yo

[Verse 1]
Carolyn from Maryland, she Lady Heroin
She elegant, her apparel in the M-Class caravan
Keys of dope, loving cats to ski in her throat
She fuck killers in her condo, her Benz and her boat
Her ice fro, ass is curvy, 40 years old
She passing for 30, Gucci framed glasses from Purvy's
Madison Ave., shopping when she not, copping bricks of that shit
She hopping on dicks, riding Pony's who trick
At my man's wake, she said the eulogy
After that I usually bumped into her shopping for jewellery
Her bodyguard screwing me, I gave her my math
Ain't nothing new to me, blowing backs out, six-pack Stout's
Wide fat mouth, the evil look with a bow-leg
Yo niggas said, "Shorty's a pro, she blow heads
She push the fo' red, she know Feds, Feds know her"
A code red, maybe she's out to slay me, this bitch is crazy
She blew the celly up, meet me at the telly to fuck
She knew about cats from way back, we smoke the haystack
She never coughed once, blunts was her hobby
She said I knew her man probably, no doubt, '96 he tried to rob me
I jetted though, sometimes you never know
He snorted all her work, now she need me to do her dirty work

[Chorus]
It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")
Nigga you reap what you sow
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know
A very small world ("It's a.. small world..")
Where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again
It's a small world ("It's a.. small world.."), you get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow
Yo it's a small world, watch what you do.. ("It's a.. small world..")

[Verse 2]
Snook from Red Hook was grimy, did 5 years, glad to be home
From Attica, known for keeping chrome calibers
Smooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it
5 years planning to blow soon as he hit the bridicks
Had a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low
Played the crib for a month and deaded his P.O
Started robbing niggas til he caught a whole kilo
He had a bunch of starving niggas he owe, he never paid though
Got large, sign on his door, "Don't knock hard"
Laying with his bitch, 'niggas is rich' is what he told her
Played the block, holding cracks inside the baby stroller
Here come his crazy soldier, 6 shots it's over
A year went past, Snook went flossing fast
His old man had crossed his ass for the laws of this fast cash

[Chorus]
It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")
Nigga you reap what you sow
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know
A very small world ("It's a.. small world..")
Where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again
It's a small world ("It's a.. small world.."), you get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow
Yo it's a small world, watch what you do.. ("It's a.. small world..")

[Verse 3]
I seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why
We let the slugs fly, enter your brain through your skull
Another thug died, pitching your soul into that infinite
Black hole where many souls go cause of a .44 blast
Snook was one of em, so many more
Even that Fendi whore got niggas hit up, yeah let that Henny pour
Carolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich
Heard her bodyguard took Snook to God
Carolyn when she needed him, he took the job
He was close to her ever since she took him inside
When his moms died, dope fiend OD'd, '85
He went crazy, stuck up banks to stay alive
He was live, do niggas even know the things that he tried
Robbed armored trucks, incidents where police died
He stayed in lower Eastside, peace God, he stared at me hard
Two of his mans with him, I got to hit 'em
I'm reaching for my Roscoe, cocked it back on
And get my blast on, at the gas station, bunch of Arabs racing
Out the way as my Taurus spray
Jump in the whip, hit the highway
You know how I say, the game that I play
It's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies
But can't figure out whose who, keep it true
Shit is cool now -- put the tools down? Never
'Cause everyday is on, livin this life, out for this cheddar

[Chorus]
It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")
Nigga you reap what you sow
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know
A very small world ("It's a.. small world..")
Where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again
It's a small world ("It's a.. small world.."), you get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow
Yo it's a small world, watch what you do.. ("It's a.. small world..")

[Outro]
I'm going to see you again..
Uh-huh.. I'm going to see you again.. nigga..
Uh-huh.. going to see you again nigga.. yeah



[Intro]
Bis-Mi-Allah A-Rahman A-Rahim
(To the Gods.. to the Gods.. to the Earths)
Pass that shit homie

[Chorus]
Now tell me what y'all smokin'
What kinda heat y'all holdin'
Well is your creep move potent?
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon
We bi-coastin', keepin our po-ckets bulgin'
We got the plan in motion
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon

[Verse 1]
Zoom, from outer space he comes
Blunt in his mouth with his hand on his gun
Bitches flappin' they gums, do he be clappin' and shootin' guys
Actor or a movie star, rapper revolutionized
What is his race, nation, or creed?
Is he Arabic, Black, Latin, Asian they read
Magazines say I walked on water, talked to the heavens
Spit at judges, stepped on peasants
But in reality, I just entered your galaxy
September '73, up in these wild streets
Fuckin' these wild freaks, a harem of hoes (God damn)
And my mystique got 'em tearin' my clothes

[Chorus]
Now tell me what y'all smokin'
What kinda heat y'all holdin'
Well is your creep move potent?
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon
We bi-coastin', keepin our po-ckets bulgin'
We got the plan in motion
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon

[Verse 2]
My nigga smoke with one lung
If he cough he might die, passin' me trees
The liquor bottle's almost empty
We about to collide, with the enemy
Only way you die if it's meant to be
You fuckin' with a general
No discussion is the principle we bust and it's the end of you
Now we knockin' on your mama door
Like we came to fix the sink; my kind of war
Death, angels coming for you
Spirit horse runnin' from your body like Young Guns 1 and 2
Paramedics fightin' for you, who's gon' win?
The hands of time, or the hands of medicine
Don't cry, witness your fate, this is your wake
Walk by your casket, spit in your face
Enter the fog dog, the light is your guide
And when you're gone all your niggas gon' light it with Nas

[Chorus]
Now tell me what y'all smokin'
What kinda heat y'all holdin'
Well is your creep move potent?
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon
We bi-coastin', keepin our po-ckets bulgin'
We got the plan in motion
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon

[Verse 3]
Pardon but I gotta question of life now
Look at the nigga next to you right now
Is he real, fake or scared?
Do it like this niggas right hands in the air
Ball it to a fist and put it over your heart
Now let's say it all together let the ceremony start
"I shall - stay real, stay true, stay holdin' figures
Never put a bitch over my niggas
I shall never, cooperate with the law
Never snake me I always hold you down in war
If they take one of mine, I take one of theirs
I never break the oath to the death I swear"
I swear that's how we pledge allegiance, to the alliance
Of underworlds killers and thugs, though the science
Of a nigga still yet to be found
So light up some green, and pass it around, pass it around

[Chorus]
Now tell me what y'all smokin'
What kinda heat y'all holdin'
Well is your creep move potent?
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon
We bi-coastin', keepin our po-ckets bulgin'
We got the plan in motion
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon

[Outro]
Wanna get high, come smoke with me
Smoke with me, light it up

[During outro]
Damn, nigga, take this weed, I'm 'bout to go over to my bitch house, get my fuck on, nigga! Y'all niggas stay up!

[During fade]
Come here, bitch, come smoke with a nigga...

[Chorus]
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)

[Verse 1]
Now this is you, dressed in all black, fatigue hat, ready for combat
A good nigga, you don't leave tracks
A hood nigga wantin' G-stacks, do what you gotta do to get that
You feel you need that, where the juxs at?
These are your niggas, creepin' they be leavin' niggas sleep witchu
Loc' style, quiet no smile, it's the official
Sometime they grimy, speakin' on they own people
They snake you if they have to, raised tattoos
Now these are your bitches, phonin' lonely homie chickens
All the homies stick 'em, you think you own 'em man, listen
She stab you in your sleep with a knife from out the kitchen
Put a root on you, next week they find you missin'
Dead in your Expedition in the forest, fell off the cliff and
Tumbled 'til you blew up, Feds told her and she threw up
Fake bitches, actresses, wicked witch practices
Two sides of us, negative and positive

[Chorus]
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)

[Verse 2]
Now this is your mom, your good luck charm
Pushin you to do no wrong, prayin for you that you live long
Nobody kill my baby, but she know her baby crazy
In and out of jail, mom's screamin', "God take me!"
This is your pop, chip off the old block that made him
The man of the house, mom and pops separatin'
Spittin' image of a gangsta, the way pop walked
The way pop talked, got older and you thanked him now
This is your hood, poor folks drugs and robberies
Turnin' into the things moms wanted you not to be
Crime followin' the wrong dudes who have no values
Life's cheap as the dime in the minds of those around you
This is the test, the stress, the conflict the ups and downs of
Niggas around you make threats
They tell you keep it gangsta, no matter the predicament
Even though your decision won't help you benefit

[Chorus]
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)

[Verse 3]
Now once again this is you, entertainin' your desires
Bitches, money and guns, aimin' and you fire
Everyday is grief, if it ain't beef, it's feedin' your seed
Tryin' to eat? You form material needs
The weed make your brain sizzle, a pistol make it cool off
By stickin' up niggas, make them take they jewels off
His reputation is, bigger than his whole life span
He never planned to fail, he just failed to plan
What does it take to realize, Satan's alive, he whispers
And any chance he get, he can take niggas
He comes in all shapes and sizes, his best disguise is
When he stand beside us, but God is inside us, within me
You are your worst enemy - my mom's words echo in my head
And if I let go I'm dead
He stepped at my door, the takes motivate my spirit
An out of body experience, so now I feel it
Lookin' at my blessings, the bullets - that missed me coulda hit me
Them court cases coulda put me in the penitentiary
I never hate, that's just wasted energy
The past is gone, the present's a gift, so what's the mystery?
The future - and time only reveals, what fear is
False expectations, appearin' real
We only human, love thy neighbor, so I was told
And I will 'til permanently, my eyes are closed

[Chorus]
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)



May laughter
For backstabbers
Turn to tears faster
For you I wish no snakes would slither past ya
Ya have ta
Keep your vision clear
Only a coward lives in fear
My surroundings, got only real powerful niggas here
Real friends we have a code of ethics
No question
No feminine tendencies
We not expecting
No gossip
No phony logic
No counting your homey pocket
Spare no expense
For legal defense
If your homey locked up
Who cares who was the last who looked out?
Selfishness
That's a character flaw
No holding out
Yo what happened to the honor?
You're dealing with
Sensitive prima donna drama
Teflon love
For my dudes who solid



[Intro: Nas]
QB, the whole NYC
We gon' bounce to this
All my niggas (yeah, yeah)
All the ladies

[Hook: Nas]
Sometimes I wonder
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger?
This game is risky
If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?
Dead partners too soon
All these niggas flippin' on me cause I won't give no loot to 'em
Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I...

[Verse 1: Nas]
Top of the world is what I'm aimin' at
These niggas is flamin' gats at my circle
I catch you, my first reaction's to hurt you; I'll hit your bird, too
Two in your scalp, then you out, your thug crew is out
Blood oozin' out, some servin' caine
Knowin' nothin' about this murder game
It's easily told but hard to hear
When niggas finally find out it's real
That's when they heart pumps fear
The real remain, the weak will disappear
My words are 20/20, my vocals are crystal clear
911 style sits on your mind like chrome
Let's say your brain's a V12, put it in drive, let it roam
What color? Might as well make it the same as your dome
You need your thoughts together means destination is unknown
As we travel on this road, an infinite path
I get into this math, drop and get intense for the cash
Will I be subject to kill? Live my life by the gat?
Just when I think I made it out, the street is calling me back

[Hook: Nas]
Sometimes I wonder
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger?
This game is risky
If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?
Dead partners too soon
All these niggas flippin' on me cause I won't give no loot to 'em
Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I...

[Verse 2: Nature]
I know a lot of fiends by their first name, livin' in Queens
A lot of cats gettin' stuck for they chains
Holdin' dirty guns, the young old dirty ones
Runnin' wild, nigga, I raise hell above ground
Live in sin, holdin' rocks, Benjamin Grimm
Figure once I got knocked, it would endnever that
They try to tell me I don't love my own
The thugs know, they ride my zone, like The Cyclone
Trademark for Coney Isle, yeah, they know me now
I'm givin' niggas fake hugs, phony smiles
Stack profits, you know how niggas on the block get
Try to give you dap just to stare at your pockets
Crews advance, nothin' new, just the rules of the land
You couldn't tell if they wolves or lamb (Ha, word)
You could fight like a few, there's a few that ran
Or you could feed them and lose your hand
What you wanna do?

[Hook: Nas]
Sometimes I wonder
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger?
This game is risky
If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?
Dead partners too soon
All these niggas flippin' on me cause I won't give no loot to 'em
Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I...

[Verse 3: Nas]
Blessings be to the ones who left us
To transcend into spiritual essence, in Allah's arms you restin'
To Him we pray for my peeps
Louie Lloyd Floyd, Twin and Taiyeh, Mr. Sonny back in the day
"Get that money, yam," he used to say
Not only nice with hands but street smarts, he was twice a man
I try to understand life's deep plot, I think of Weewop
Shikeisha, they both was mad nice on the rock
They woulda went pro, but only God, he only knows why not
Like my nigga Bing, let your sneakers be not clean
You come around, he start snappin' on you, makin' a scene
Kept the lye, cool nigga, warm heart, and stayed fly
You still alive, I see you in your sister's face
Are you nearby or lookin' on, just from a distant place?
My thoroughbreds, Black Ed, quiet but real
Expect to see your black Jeep come fly over the hill
In the spirit of Richie Lou, tribute
Remind the world of the crime that NY pigs do, we miss you
Never forget you, Harry and Sonia
Rest in peace to Marty, a 41st side of Vernon soldier
T.J. Black, better known as Killer
I can't replace you, but in me
Havoc will always have a brother, my nigga
My man Will, until we meet again
You hold it up there, I'll hold it down here
I hope y'all hear my prayers clear

[Hook: Nas]
Sometimes I wonder
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger?
This game is risky
If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?
Dead partners too soon
All these niggas flippin' on me cause I won't give no loot to 'em
Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I...

[Outro: Nas]
Rest in peace to my grandfathers, Papa Charlie...
(Will a nigga go under because of his hunger?)
Rest in peace to my man's Horse pops, nam'sayin'? One love
(If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?)
Can't forget Nana, my man L.E.S. grandmom, nam'sayin'?
(All these niggas flippin' on me cause I won't give no loot to 'em)
They still wit' us, though; I wonder where they at?
(Sometimes I...) How near, how far?
Sometimes I wonder (What?)
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger? (Can't go under)
This game is risky
If a nigga slipped six feet, will these niggas really miss me?



[Intro: Nas]
Squeeze!
Squeezin' on ya; real niggas creepin' on ya

[Verse 1: Nas]
I got cream, some ganja trees, and fronto leaves
Honda bikes, diamond dykes, rubbin' me, lovin' me
Don't let my seed hear this, cover her ears
Real shit; no surrender, no fear, we pioneers
Of all this ice shit, biscuits, and tight whips, rims
Bangin' blends in the S-Class, half a thousand
Slap pounds with cats who shot down shit
Real niggas who stay around chips, and down Cris
Sips of Henny; chicks who bless you, finessin' it, professional
Slob with ice cubes, just like Vanessa do
Reppin Q, smoke amazing Thai
Shit that givin' you triple Asian eye
Yeah, bitch, a nigga stayin' fly
From tube socks and Timbs, to blue rocks, a Benz
Who got the ends?
The type'll make 2Pac [?]
To all niggas who shine; yes, who got revenge
I won't showboat, my flow choke you
And if it don't, the fo' fo'll smoke you
Left your seed reminiscin' on ya
MC's I'm pissin' on ya
Shine cause my chips are longer
It's gremlins I'm sic'n on ya
Shots your dodgin'
While Esco could rock the whole fuckin' Garden
Real niggas always gon' play this shit..



[Produced by Large Professor]

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yo, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
For niggas up in they mom's crib listenin
To this unadulterated Nas shit wishin it was them
Instead of, me on this track on this beach with palm trees
Drinks with umbrellas straws telling it raw
Jungle of concrete killers and snakes I was amongst that
Bundles of crack through this funnel that's black
I want you to vision through my telescope see the hell I wrote
It's Reynolds when I Wrap it like a envelope package
And they was into dope back then
Numbers, pimpin and robbin, well they still robbin and pimpin
But it's small change compare to hip hoppin
And did I mention millions because of lip poppin
Trips expensive gift shoppin whip drivin
Benzes, Jeeps, see, them and they bitch got one
It's shockin you thinkin naw it's just rhymin
But all this time it's like organized crimin
For instance, there was a time when there was a line
Between streets and business, but now peep how it's mixed in
The beef is now sickenin, everybody got paper
Words of power, because of it the cops hate ya
The government watchin all of those who thuggin it
They wanna lock us up cause they kids are lovin it
Not knowin that most rappers are straight ass
The shots ring out, whenever we clash it's Star Wars

[Hook]
We call it Star Wars
What happens when the shots ring out, Star Wars
We call it Star Wars

[Verse 2]
Caviar never, I rather the Cajun blacken
Catfish no snails simple nigga to please
Met a bad bitch dimples in her cheeks
She remembers Busy Bee battles when it was peace
Caught myself driftin in thought, cause now it's different I thought
Niggas was raised off the shit I record
Like I was brought up off that Planet Rock
Kurtis Blow, James Todd Smith, Shan and Scott LaRock in the jams
Why would they fuck with a don, Jehovah witness
Him and his co-defendants, I eat 'em like Lucky Charms
With two percent low fat milk, five percent pro black built
It's nothin mother had a motherfucker
I don't think about it niggas talkin there's a lot of gossip
That I'm a prophet or I can't go back to my projects
Can I? Does a plant grow from a pot yes
Do trees grow from a forest MC's y'all are clitoris
Y'all niggas roll with any click that's winnin any crew
Doin whatever's trendy, even they leave me too
Ain't enough room in this town
What is beef between ghetto word spitters with crowns, Star Wars

[Hook]
Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out everywhere, Star Wars
Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out

[Verse 3]
This ain't, no Oscars or MTV or Joan Rivers fashion police
Not what you read in tabloid seats
These are MC's that live by the code, it's hard for me to spit it
Because the game was supposed to be sold, we live it
Came from the streets we the voice of the youth
America's nightmare was given a mic booth
Nike boots, leathers and jean, jewelry, cribs and cars
Rappers not dependin on your nine to five jobs
Entertainment, this is our world this is our language
Different regions speakin east and west gang shit
You got your positive shit like, Common Sense
But even he had drama with the Don Mega Cube
Acknowledge the words get twisted at times it's rules
What you think is different from the block whenever we feud
Fuck your pictures and your plaques your tours and autographs
Don't trust bitches and niggas who tell you your all of that
Cause, they'll be in your enemies face, sayin it's safe
To run in your release party sprayin the place
Or catch you when you least on point, putting your keys in the door
Behind you with your seeds in KB Toys store
Maybe the words get disrespectful now your niggas check you
You 'gon let that nigga play you, you know we 'gon rep you
Next mornin every news channel and front page
Headlines another rapper was slayed, this is Star Wars

(Staaaaaaaay...)

[Chorus]
(Staaaaaaaay...) Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh
Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooooh...
Staaaaaaaay... Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh
Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooooh-ooh-oh...

[Verse 1]
Peace to the Five Percenters, online engine inventors
Shout to them niggas, family men, bringing home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt your happy home
Miserable and alone, kissable, nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse, she fuck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first, can watch you on my phone
I shop in Barcelona, I spend some nights in Rome
Feel like a Knight from England
That's what I named my son, Knight
He was born to be one, that's how my game was won
White 740 Bimmer, licked by an angel's tongue
I'm living dangerous son, she got a man, a famous one
Honey be pocket watching, she got a lot of options
Hard to make up her mind deciding which baller to rock with
Hot to death, slim pickings but I'm not impressed
She got the hottest sex, so I guess I'ma just.. stay

[Chorus]
(Staaaaaaaay...) Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh
Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooooh...
Staaaaaaaay... Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh
Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooooh-ooh-oh...

[Verse 2]
Even though I don't like you
Next Friday night can't wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you, don't fuck with you
Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked
I felt bad, wait do I got love for you?
I might kill you but do I got love for you?
I want you dead under six feet of soil
At the same time, want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other but it's love, what a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy
We enemies but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame cause they need validation
Some say hating is confused admiration
Spotlight on me, I still look twenty
Still get money, lady killer pushing a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures
Through a nigga who realer
I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to.. stay

[Chorus]
(Staaaaaaaay...) Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh
Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooooh...
Staaaaaaaay... Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh
Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooooh-ooh-oh...

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
You can drop a Wet Floor sign down for the tears
God and my court date, the two things I fear
Man, they tryna give a nigga years
Im tryna figure if I should even appear
Or should I escape town? Catch a Greyhound
Change my name, right  catch a plane flight
Out the country, let them mafuckas hunt me
Come and catch me if you want me
Know theyll lock me if I stay
But where Imma run to?
I got a good girl, we got a son too
And all we went through, we aint see eye-to-eye
But what you told me way back, you was a ride-or-die
So if they give me one, or if they give me two
Or if a nigga gotta sit down and do a few
Before I go, baby, I gotta know, what would you do?
Would you find someone new or would you stay?
Like the hoes when they lay with me?
Puppy eyes when I go, sayin stay with me
Aw, girl, you bad as hell and yet Id love to
But see I got a girl Im really makin love to
Therefore Im feelin a lot more guilty when I rub you
Thats why I skip all of that kissin when I fuck you
Flush the condom down the toilet then I skate
I had you, but you cant have me, I never stay

[Hook]
Stay

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Ha! Life in a hometown, fore I could take a step
Im gettin grown now
And startin to notice that I see the same hoes around
Guess they had to go round, my raps is profound
I got the flows, but yet a nigga aint got no sound
Copped a beat machine, Im cookin up my own now
Got my mind on the city where it goes down
See, if Imma get to where Im goin then I cant stay
Although I love it here
Ill be damned if I sit around another year
Dreamin dreams, hopin somehow that they just appear
The hardest part of leavin is to know my mother here
Oh, but Im comin back  oh boy, believe that
Lets show the little niggas, boy, you can achieve that
Got the city on my shoulders, piggy back
Hello, my name is Cole and Im here to stay



[Produced by Kanye West]

[Intro: Kanye West]
And as the sun sets
And the night falls
And them hoes call

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
He pulled up at 6:30 in a 745
As he waving "Shorty, hi", you know he showin' his bling out
She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out
His girl caught feelings, she mad, she threw the ring out
How she found out she dreamt the whole thing out
Y'all be going through problems, you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep? What do you think 'bout?
If y'all get a divorce
She gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out
Make it so cold that you gotta pull your mink out
Or grab your roller skates and turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle
Meanwhile, she out doing the same thing now
Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out

[Adlibs over sampled hook]
One two, one two
Some dreams stay dreams, some dreams come true
One two, one two
Some dreams stay dreams, some dreams come true
Some people really
Some people really
Some people really are still dreaming

[Verse 2: Nas]
How you a man waiting for the next man to get rich?
Your plan is to stick out your hand real quick
So if he feed your family and he serve you shit
Then he need that head you get and he deserve your bitch
Since you wishin' cash fall from the sky all your life
Dwellin' on the past when you was alright
When you was getting cash but wasn't too bright
Now your luck down, you feel like bustin' them shells
Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self
Want niggas to show you, how to come up with green
I schemed since I'm 14, what the fuck was your dream?
Rental cars, little broads, saying you was seen
With little niggas with a chain, you was doing your thing
How high was I? You the thousandth guy
That came around thinking we can see eye to eye
We on a different echelon
Could've got bread together, now you get skedded on

[Refrain: Sample of Kanye West and Nas]

[Verse 3: Nas]
She had several cars, she had credit cards
A castle, large master bathroom, getting a pedicure
Bellinis by the glassful, said she been meaning to ask who
Who in need of cash who, who could blast tools
And I'm eating cashews, knew she was bad news
But we mad cool, nothin' sexual
Cause I knew her since high school
Grew up with my dudes, like one of my crew
She worked for Fox News
One of her mans that she lent her drop to
Won't come back with it, so she want him clapped in it
Says it's important that it looks like an accident
She was snorting and her eyes had bags in it
She was recording, had a wire, askin' shit
Four days before I came by she got bagged with bricks
Crossed the line from her world of news castin'
To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards

[Refrain: sample + Kanye and Nas]

[Sample of "They are still dreaming" to end]

[Produced Eric B]

[Intro]
Ayo Nasty Nas, what up?
~Ain't nothing, a lot of cowards fronting
I hear what you're saying, but yo, this is all love for me, you know?
~No doubt, smoke them cowards, you stillmatic

[Verse]
Ma, I'm sorry who the fuck I am, I can't trust my fans
Out of luck, no constructive plans
My friends stay powdered up, I'm so drunk, can't stand
You said if I would sober up, I'd be a powerful man
Turned out the street life, you prayed I wouldn't
But every church in the world can't save our children
I stayed out late, you heard shots, thought it would be
Your oldest son on the ground dead, but fortunately
Them bullets had some other names on it, the brother was blind
I hit the L, then, we yell out, "It wasn't my time!"
I loaded up shells, one by one
You smelled blunts from my room door, little Nasir was at war
And little did I care what you saw
Crew deep with a few heat, now it's time we settle the score
But in the projects, I vision Muhammad, in linen garments
Preaching man, woman, and child, the living Prophet
And I'm similar, Nasir Bin Olu Dara Visqu Allah
Fist full of dollars in the dice game, God
The Ice King, God, the Black Christ, elegant stance
Clothes fit me like a crime boss, the medicine man
I see the world collapsing, young pregnancies
Young girls are unfastening their Sasoon jeans, no prophylactic
All this fast shit and fly jewelry, now makes my eyes teary
N.Y. City, grab a hold and ride with me
Rip the Freeway, shoot through Memphis with MoneyBags
Stop in Philly, order cheese steaks and eat Beans fast
And bring it back up top, remove the fake king of New York
You show off, I count dough off when you sample my voice
I rule you, before, you used to rap like the Fu-Schnickens
Nas designed your Blueprint, who you kidding?
Is he H to the izz-O, M to the izz-O?
For shizzle you phony, the rapping version of Sisqo
And that's for certain, you clone me, your wack clothes line
I'd rather Sean John, you bore me with your fake coke rhymes
And those times, they never took place, you liar
Un was your first court case, you had no priors
You master fabricated stories of streets and sound slick
Have you surrounded, you and the faggots you down with
While they riding Nas, trying to boost their careers
Corny as Cormega, all you Hip-Hop queers
Since Illmatic, It Was Written, I Am Nastradamus
That's the answers to the puzzle I gave you, now here's a promise
My next few albums, instead of projects
They'll be a difficult test inside the cover for the mind's optics
Come in my hood, but bring the guns with you, it's dark
Headed through Brooklyn, Queens, Harlem, Staten, and Bronx
Headed through Compton, Oaktown, South Central, and Watts
New Orleans, Mississippi, Chi-town, every block
I'm trying to have my positive ways, I put my rhymes on page
Did crimes and headline on stage
I signed a contract, so here it is, you have it
Street's Disciple, I'm Stillmatic

[Female voice sample]
You make me feel so good



Ma, I'm sorry who the fuck I AM, I can't trust my fans
Out of luck, no constructive plans
My friends stay powdered up, I'm so drunk, can't stand

Streets Disciple, I'm Stillmatic



[Intro]
Uhh, y'know
I still run with that, that blood of a slave, boilin' in my veins
It's just hot - until a nigga can't take it no more
Blood of a slave, heart of a King - turn my voice up

[Verse]
Ayo, the brother's Stillmatic
I crawled up out of that grave, wipin' the dirt, cleanin' my shirt
They thought I'd make another Illmatic
But it's always forward I'm movin'
Never backwards stupid here's another classic
C-notes is fallin' from the sky, by now the credits roll
They're starrin' Nas, executive poet, produced directed by
The Kid slash Escobar; narration describes
The lives of lost tribes in the ghetto tryin' to survive
The feature opens with this young black child, fingers scratched
Cigarette burns on the sofa, turnin' the TV down
While Mary Jane Girls, 45's playin', soft in the background
Food from C-Town's, mornings was hash browns
Stepped over dope fiends, walkin' out the door, all of us poor
I learned the difference 'tween the snitches
The real ones, and who's soft, and the murderous, hungriest crews
People jumpin' from roofs
Shotguns pumpin', made it through my youth
Walkin' very thin lines, ages seven and nine
That's the age I was on my album cover, this is the rebirth
I know the streets thirst water like Moses
Walkin' through the hot desert searchin' to be free
This is my ending and my new beginning - nostalgia
Alpha and Omega places, it's like a glitch in The Matrix
I seen it all, did it all, most of y'all will pop for a minute
Spit a sentence then the game'll get rid of y'all
Y'all got there but y'all ain't get it all, I want my style back
Hate to cease y'all plan it's the rap repo man
To them double up hustlers, bidders, niggas who real
Professional stick-up kids dreamin' for mils
Let my words guide you, get inside you
From Crips to Pirus, this is survival

[Outro]
Blood of a slave, heart of a King
Blood of a slave, heart of a King
Uhh, uhh, blood of a slave, heart of a King
Uhh, yeah
Huh, Braveheart, uhh..



[Verse 1: Nas]
Blaze a 50, sit back in the drop top Azure Bentley
Of course with me, this chick who'd make Bobby divorce Whitney
Brazilian candy, from Miami
Masseuse, wedding ring on, loving Celine Dion
Hate rap, told me where she get cake at
She's a part-time dancer, part time romancer
Tries to be a mother when she gets a chance to
Left her husband alone to raise they son, he's in pampers
Modeled for a year, got her bachelors degree
33, recovering from plastic surgery
Went from 34B to 36 double D
Met her in San Diego at tha Super Bowl party
Had the Henny, sipped it up with Terrell Davis
MVP, we flicked it up from Sports Illustrated
I was silked out, flossing with Stoute, he had the gators
When she walked in, she lit up the room like Las Vegas
Terrell said her man's a fullback for the Raiders
A drunk who'd fuck cheerleaders and wind up in the papers
It's easy to get the pussy, just don't fall in love
Next thing you know I'm hugged up with this bitch in the tub
Palm Springs, Al Capone's Suite washing her feet
Is this love? Somebody's wife fucking a thug
Hitting it raw, tasting it, wilding out of my character
Taping it, Tyra Banks face with Faiths lips
Giving head like she knew me for years
Pillow talk, she let out tears, told me bout her husbands affairs
Millions she would get if his neck got slit
She rolled the equality, then passed the la to me
Told me 'bout her man's life insurance policy
He stays on the golf course, wears Le Coq Sport
Evenings he drinks his wines on his private resort
You can take him there, here go the keys, you can slip in the rear
Chop a nigga up, yo, meet me somewhere
So we can make more money, then you could ever see rapping
Split the cash and move to Venezuela, adapting
P-11's, ACP shells for blasting
Caught him with his spanish maid
He had a lighter with a can of spray, burning her legs
She tied to the bed, sex S&M, sadomasochistic
Sadistic, yoked her from behind, blew him out exsistance
His maid cried "No", lucky she was blindfold
Naked with mad burn marks all on her thighs, yo
Twelve point five million, he kept his funds
In the Lloyd's of London, goes to his wife and his children
Yo, I thought "What if shorty gets scared, electric chair's all I envision
All she'll probably get is psychiatric supervision"
I switched the plan, the maid flied to Switzerland
Fake ID, forged his wife name, catch the next flight
The same night, headed to Spain, nice game
Now we're back to where we meet again

[Verse 2: Nas]
Blaze a 50, sit back in a drop-top Azure Bentley
Of course with me, this chick who'd make Bobby divorce Whitney
Top down, night air blow her hair
Sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare
Fastlane on the nine-five, honey laughs about the cash
Took a blast out of her coke bag
Snorted it, started screaming "Yo, we almost crashed!"
Earlier I took the coke out, replaced it with crushed up glass
Her head nodded down to her chest, slowly she fell asleep
Overwhelmed by greed, put to death

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 1]
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half a million
Without the FBI catching feelings

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 2]
From Fat Cat to Pappy, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from being alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich
But now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Wally moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 3]
Growing up project-struck, looking for luck, dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny, getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something



"Uh. What?! What?! Uh."

Street dreams are made of these
Thugs drop Beemers wit' three-hundred E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a ki
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for playas wit' big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'

[Noise and a gun shot]

My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware wit' one change of gear
Nothin' on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
Wit' the glaze in my eye that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents- A fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'mma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up for realty
For real, G, I'mma fullfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my C.R.E.A.M
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch wit' the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates, got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
F' God sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half million
Without the FBI catchin' feelin's

Street dreams are made of these
Thugs drop Beemers wit' three-hundred E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a ki
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for playas wit' big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'

From fat cat to papi, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holdin' gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Livin wit' moms, gettin it on, flushin' crack
Down the toilet- Two sips from bein' alcoholic
Nine-hundred-ninety-nine thou from bein' rich but now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team for a wiser dream, we could all score it
The cartel, Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel smokin' on sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass, yo, the dogs never seen her
She got me back livin' sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while hoppin' in the drop-top B-M

"Word is bond, son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this."
("Uh. What? What? Word?")

Street dreams are made of these
Thugs drop Beemers wit' three-hundred E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a ki
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for playas wit' big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'

Ill designer fleece, studded marquise
A letta L on my car keys- Thuggin' hard on Cavarse
'Posters be Franchesco and all these bets
Mobile phones in the armrest, ladies be the bombest
I creep tinted, parked the whip and grabbed the rented
Seems like I'm changin' my location every minute
Like a plague is on my head, son- I vision red rum
Warrent squads knockin' at the same time the Feds come
Pandemonium got me puffin' Cambodian
Grand openin's of barber shops and stock
My jew-el rock, tokin' pronto- Livin' like a pablo
Papi like a poncho until the state patrollers pulled us over
Found the guns and the good
Had a nigga like 'Nas had to run through the woods'
Sneakin' out the next mornin'- Looked up to God
Guess in all this was a fuckin' warnin'
Took my diamonds in for the pawnin'
Now I'm back on the climbin'
Movin' consigned through rain, sleet, whatever climate
So many ups and downs shiftin', I was twisted minded
'Mazed on top, all the hoes and pussy had me blinded
Big lip bitches, suckin' dick rediculous
GS'es and vest-es, larger rays lookin' sentious
Back on the block buggin', how the fuck I been through this?
Nearly caused my life but now I can't show a cent from it

Street dreams are made of these
Thugs drop Beemers wit' three-hundred E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a ki
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for playas wit' big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'

[Noise and a gun shot]



[Intro: Nas]
Yo, this remix goes out to everybody out there
That call theyself "keepin' it real"
From yours truly, Escobar and Big R
From New York to Chi-Town
Check it out now
Commissioner Steve Stoute
Trackmasters, QB, check it, yo

[Verse 1: Nas]
Low profile, rap style, slick as Nu Nile
Give the crew pounds every time we cover new ground
Still survivin' but there's a few down, back in the essence
I'm askin' questions on the phone with jail adolescents
Quiet confession, the system's applyin' the pressure
My mind is guessin', is livin' and dyin' a lesson?
But not to be obliged with the mirage of cars
Take me off track from what the Gods focus on hard
Laid up, smokin' cigars, motionin' maids
To bring me toast and eggs kosher
Ice chokers and wolves to smoke ya
My wisdom culture lives in ultra madness
Devoted Coach bag bitch
Broke, the average nigga's hopes to get mad rich
But what's the purpose?
Only the Gods can watch the Earth twist
I'm physically trapped down on the surface
With all the crack merchants, snakes and serpents
Foul jakes that search us
Clowns with four pounds, this ain't a circus

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Street dreamer (Oh mercy mercy me)
Ain't nothin' out there for ya
(There ain't nothin' out there for you)
Situations gettin' heavy
Heavy, heavy, tryin' to be a gangsta

[Verse 2: Nas]
Black clouds over the hood, I'm on the corner with the thugs
Late night under the Moon as they assume I'm slangin' drugs
'Cause I'm hooded up, thought a G a night wasn't good enough
Pushed my luck, yo, they had a brother put in cuffs
Luckily, made it out of court comfortably
Judge said I need a job, ain't nothin' comin' free
Could've got a one to three
I try to school these shorties under me
But they can't see, from life to death
So now we back to where we never left
The ghetto  it's a damn shame, knowin' it's a man's game
Shorty thinks it's time to make your plans change
All that runnin' round tryin' to chase what's already here
Been there, it's goin' nowhere
Pops told me knuckle up, no fear
I wish some of these killings they could be prevented
Whatever happens, it was written, meaning God meant it
But during life, you put your heart in it
Even though it seems we bein' targeted
Let that brother R hit it

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Street dreamer (Oh mercy mercy me)
Ain't nothin' out there for ya
(There ain't nothin' out there for you)
Situations gettin' heavy
Heavy, heavy, tryin' to be a gangsta

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Street dreamer, yeah
Street dreamer, dream on
Dream on

[Verse 3: Nas (R. Kelly)]
Sort of wild; since a child, hope was all we had
Dreamt of plushed-out pads
Complainin', the mental strainin'
How many in my crew was into gainin'?
Subtract the weak links up out the chain and
Rise and start reignin'
Blasphemy usin' Nas' name in vain
Some claim supreme being yet they lied in his name
I tried to learn the game and only thing I found incredible
Everything I tried to learn, see, I already knew (that's right)
And it's embedded in my heart now
So I could sit back, count a stack, and play my part now
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes, he wore disguise
Put a gun to me, hungry, he went on to chastise
"That's Nas, ain't it? Made it rich from entertainment"
Fresh Wally's painted, as he told the kid he came with
My first thought was: "How the game flip?"
Yo, perhaps it was somebody I smacked drunk in a party on 'gac
Or was I marked for a contract for some foul act
I did a while back or even beyond that
He got me layin' face flat, sayin' my grace, Black
Woke up in a cold sweat, yo, I hate that
Nightmares feelin' real, word to Will
My A-Alike I lost in the battlefield
That's why I hit the mic with mad appeal
Grab your shield and meet your maker
The Queens niggas die for paper
Deed the things, the street dreams will take ya

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Street dreamer (Oh mercy mercy me)
Ain't nothin' out there for ya
(There ain't nothin' out there for you)
Situations gettin' heavy
Heavy, heavy, tryin' to be a gangsta
Street dreamer (Oh mercy mercy me)
Ain't nothin' out there for ya
(There ain't nothin' out there for you)
Situations gettin' heavy
Heavy, heavy, tryin' to be a gangsta
Street dreamer (Oh mercy mercy me)
Ain't nothin' out there for ya
(There ain't nothin' out there for you)
Situations gettin' heavy
Heavy, heavy, tryin' to be a gangsta







[Pop] (Intro)
Uhh, still out in these motherfuckin projects
Still a nigga ain't never gonna get the fuck up outta here
Niggas just don't understand the story

Chorus: [Pop]
Niggas die for the street glory
Go to trial get tried for each story
And each nigga got a story
And QB the streets call me
So if you see me slippin' reach for me
I'm goin' after street glory
Go to trial get tried for each story
And each nigga got a story
And QB the streets call me
So if you see me slippin' reach for me
I'm goin' after street glory

[NAS]
Yo
Every time I turn around niggas shot, niggas stabbed
When tonight's pregnant girls struggling to get a cab
Fiends lurkin', D's searchin', pat pockets
Kids put to bed duck they heads from gats poppin'
Queensbridge slingers hoppin' out Benzes
Don status, dope fiends got syringes
Poppin' out their arm scratching
I remember park jams
Gazelles, perfect wave, shell Adidas
Smellin' reefer way before purple haze
Private stock peer nigga with ill walks like Mark Clare
Hats tilted wild niggas lickin' shots in the air
Me and Pop was there, through the years our names have switched
Ain't nothin' changed but the names Nastradamus and Blitz
What project is this? QB, Vernon and 10th
12th street murderous pimps, hot as hell's heat
What could you tell me? Nigga's seen it all in this game
When it's all said and done just remember my name

[Pop]
I'm familiar with the dead grass drama black gates and crime
Embryo of the ghetto born face and time
Niggas shatter they dreams while I'm chasing mine
Ghetto fame got a fellow's name draped and shined
How do I describe an atmosphere where streets are polluted?
Where corruptors and new police being recruited
Somehow I make it through the day stayin' secluded
While the blues aim leavin' another slain, executed
Many thought's cause I see the past grimmly
That could've been me, explodes out on 41st and 10th street
Through all the pap grease and street chases
Sudden raids and confrontations leadin' the misdeamenor weed cases
I blew smoke through hallway window
Watched the buddah clouds linger
Pluckin the blunt brokes from my fingers
My eyes flip different shades
Similar to people you meet everyday who be displayin' wicked ways
Seein' nothing but another day
In this six story rat trap
Them gats clap another nigga's blazed
Events in my hood rotate
Like the barrel on the 38 snob in the world of fake love
Before I blaze son, I'm kissing the slugs
Coming at you kisses and hugs
When death calls who's really a thug
The street glory got me deeply in love
Can't shake it, can't take it, can't make it
Got me needin' this drug

(Chorus)



[Nas]
[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You was born in the eighties, pops drove a Mercedes
Did a bid, coming home to some grown ass kid
Crack baby turn to young thug, description might fit you
Look around it might hit you
No joke, I wanna pistol fight with you
Shit comes around faster than you think
Blood and white chalk makes pink, so what's that make you?
Become a creature of habitat, the average cat
Won't see where it's at, or where it's going
The hood waits for no one
I've been through it from Ewings to Buicks, to body viewings
Car chases to court cases, to fly vacations
From wanting it all, to being the object of your admiration
Imagination is what they lack
It stops niggas from getting stacks
Feeling trapped on the block with loose cracks
Wisdom is vital for the survival of the street's disciple

[Hook]
"From the day you were born" (Olu Daru sample)
"Starring out, a young disciple" (Nas Sample)
"You had that gleam in your eye" (Olu Daru sample)
Disciple of the projects!
"From the day you were born" (Olu Daru sample)
"Street's Disciple" (Nas Sample)
"Disciple of the projects" (Olu Daru sample)

[Nas]
Moonstruck stuck, slow as molasses in my actions
That's compliments of a fast spliff in the night life
In my flight jacket, adrenaline heightened, mimickin Tyson
After watchin him cut up Razor Ruddock
In the gutter, which was once ghetto prophecy is now ghetto scripture
Lookin back at it, blowjobs from pretty crack addicts
Older Gods wantin no static, told some lil' niggas they can have it
Coke baggin and toe-taggin
They took Will, let me describe him, a live one
I think that he was the true +God's Son+ - not Jesus, but fearless
His ear was up on them sounds too, he'd hear somethin
Not to his likin, and say 'Son they bitin you"
He never got to see my debut, wild-mannered
But wild with them hammers, niggas frontin couldn't stand it
Took him off the planet, left us in 9-2
With the philosophy of what arms do, a true street's disciple

[Hook]

[Nas]
Plug the mics up, I'm ready to rock, knocking
Reminiscing of measuring pots of Pyrex, cook in the kitchen
Captain Hook to these infants
It's like my folks is still on the benches
Surrounded by villains and henchmen, was a killer convention
1991, son, gold fronts on the facial, gun buck by the naval
Disciple could blaze you, we laced it with embalming fluid
Rhyming to music all this time
Fighting 'bout how Kane and Rakim would do it
Seemed impossible to us that we could ever leave
From the block, where the world was forever freezing
Hell if I ever let them shovel me, son, in this cell again
Fuck these devil policemen, plush leathers, I need them
Risking my freedom, burners in bubble coats
Fuck a sermon from the neighborhood pope
He's sexing ho's, old fart, he's busting ones when he stroke
Multi-colored Pelle Pelle's, young stretch mark bellies
Babies born in a cycle, future disciples

[Hook]

[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Ay fellas
I-I think you might wanna s-s-s-sneak your ratchet in here for this one
Ay ladies
Put the petroleum jelly on your face
Ayo Nas, we got a big bet in the streets that you knock their ass out in the first 30 seconds of the first round
Get them!

[Verse One: Nas]
Sitting up drunk, shuffling thoughts
Got paper but I'm lost
Losing focus, what a nigga still hustling for?
My seed is straight, the family's settled
Idle time get the man in trouble
When wifey tourin', my life get borin'
Start to remember all types of torment
The devil's callin', but I don't answer
Mom passed from cancer, leaving behind
Two granddaughters, two grandsons, two nines
Next to me in the Phantom, who lying?
Big screen documentaries of Idi Amin
Dada, trying to stay away from creeps
With their bullshit, trying to put me back in the streets
War stories, funerals
Where Feds be laying, from a dreadful slaying
Body viewings, at the wake
Nigga sit stiff in his Ferrari, no casket
With his eyelids still open, it's kinda spooky
Iceman watch on, the suit Gucci
I'm above the standard
But dudes is more zealous than Branford
Thinking you're too rich, they want to gun ya
Kidnap ya, cause of they hunger, but you fucking with hunters
Camouflaged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggas die over dumb shit
Camouflaged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggas die over dumb shit

[Hook (x2): Busta Rhymes]
Fight, fists, dance, sucker
Suicide, bounce, brother
Ice, whips, cash, nigga
Watch your, big, ass, momma

[Verse Two: Nas]
To your, power structure, Nas is dangerous
Y'all the antithesis, the opposite
Twitching shit, all up in your body language
Mean mugging your bitch, because she leans over
To look closer, told you: "Y'all sloppy gangsters", saying:
"Nas is this, and Nas is that"
Your eyes go front, your eyes go back
Surprised I'm at the same place y'all be at
It's obvious you don't know how I react
Like, I don't know where the party's at
You're foaming at the mouth, losing breath
Like a cardiac arrest, but I ain't impressed
Because the fact is, y'all don't really want it
Two to the head, four to the stomach
Call more security because, I come off
Anywhere you at, you scary cats
If you dare squeeze back, guns shall rain
A thousand times harder, than when I first came
Y'all not relentless, y'all dumb
And y'all just forgot about the consequences
Not a jail sentence, but see
The nigga you feed'll kick it to dude, that kick it to me
We posess, the recipes for death, because jealousy destroys
Feed the dog first, watch out for Salmonella poisoning
I know a kid who'll throw shit in your food
And say: "That's the way you kill a man
Avoid the shooting", hey {*echo* x4}

[Hook (x2): Busta Rhymes]
Fight, fists, dance, sucker
Suicide, bounce, brother
Ice, whips, cash, nigga
Watch your, big, ass, momma

[Outro: Quan, (Busta Rhymes)]
You smile, in my face
Secretly I know, you want my place
You waiting on me to choke, don't want a nigga to breathe
Want to come cut my throat, you want to get rid of me
But before I let it happen, them guns going to start clapping
And y'all going to rest in peace, because death is the recipe
Before I let it happen them guns going to start clappin
And y'all going to rest in peace, because death is the recipe

(Suicide, bounce, brother) (x4)

[Verse 1: Nas]
Got the summer on smash, eighteen karats
Lil' overweight, hit the gym
Let's go get the abs in
Louis belt hangs on the waist, it ain't even fastened
I'm trying to get every number from every woman passing me by
She's fly; Black, Asian, Boricua
Italian, mixed chicks, Middle Eastern
Eritrean, Ethiopian, how you opening?
Just rolled four with them, 'bout to smoke again
Rose-gold Rollie, riding the top down
How does Pucci bathing suits on a yacht, sound?
Send a massive Email to the females
Tell 'em where to meet us, give 'em the details

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & Miguel]
CROC on splash (splash), summer on smash (smash)

[Verse 2: Nas]
We got the jam here, check it
It's the summertime, women damn near naked
It's single season, they choosing who to mess with
I just smashed another belt for the record, respect it
Nas get you out your seats, play this in your Jeeps
My people in the streets, I make it feel like its the beach
My goons close by, I'm daring one of y'all to reach
Im protected like the President, ain't gotta give a speech
Got a compass on the wrist, Illmatic on the feets
And they ain't even out yet, she like CROC peach
Chain-smoke cigars, count a whole lot of cash
And yall already know who got the summer on smash

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & Miguel]
CROC on splash (splash), summer on smash (smash)

[Verse 3: Miguel]
I gotta do something kinda unexpected, huh?
Bad bitches, champagne wishes
Freaks only baby, let me take pictures
Skin, sin, wait, do you know whose pool you're in?
Beaches in Brazil, steaks on a grill
Your body is a weapon that you cant conceal
Real make money when the freaks call
Summer on Mars, its totally Total Recall
Like, pura vida, she wanna flyyyy
Caliente, mami vente, vente comigo, ayooooooooooooo

[Intro]
But that's the whole, tragic, point my friends!
What would I do if I could suddenly feel
And to know once again that what I feel is real?
I could cry, I could smile
I might lay back for a while
Tell me what, what, what would I do if I could feel?

[Verse 1]
I was young, I was survivin' the times
Waitin' for my moment, I was destined to shine
Little Ray had an NSX, I was hopin' I'm next
Wantin' bracelets, never hada rope on my neck
Unless I was holdin' Taiyeh chain  Rest In Peace
Even though that night you flipped on us, you warned us
If you came back and we still on the corners, we goners
Movin' on to move your arm in your watch
To another time on the block
Cause this 40 Side where they say shorty rhyme
Tragedy, he used to come through all the time
I'm talkin' Juice Crew, not what the word define
He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine
That was my first crush, I bought my first mic
I wrote my first verse, I was about nine
I was about mine, fantasize house buyin'
Met Paul, he wore some big glasses
Him and Melquan took me where G Rap lived
I was happy just gettin' some answers
I ain't even know what a record advance was
I'm seein' hoes sex in the studio bathroom
With rap dudes, thinkin', "Wow, she moved me!"
Same girl then right now's a groupie
Back then she was like the star in a movie
Large jewelry and expensive Gucci
Next stop, Paid In Full posse recruits me
Knew they were some millionaires, their ropes were dookie
Eric B man lookin' like touch it, he shoot me
You see, every time Ra didn't show
I get to record demos at attempts to blow
I wonder, could they tell? How did they know?
Sixteen years later, here I go

[Chorus: Nipsey Russell]
"What-what, what-what, what would I do?"
"What-what, what-what, what would I do?"
"What-what, what-what, what would I do?"
"What-what, what-what, what would I do?"

[Verse 2]
I'm with Akinyele in the street, tryin' to get us a deal
G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill
But Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted
Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us
Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted
Reef and Matty C offered me a little money
Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter
Rebel of Hip-Hop comin' through a white rapper
My boy MC Serch, nevertheless
Took me to Columbia, back then CBS
Chris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man
Now buggin' because the label had just dropped Def Jam
Could you picture Russell needin' a check, man?
But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram
Life is ill, again life's a movie
Then the roster's Cypress Hill, Nas and Fugees
Before I sold records, no promotion
The rap world like, "What's all this commotion?"
Went plat, mad bottles I'm toastin'
20/20 hindsight, but how did they know then?

[Chorus: Nipsey Russell]
"What-what, what-what, what would I do?"
"What-what, what-what, what would I do?"
"What-what, what-what, what would I do?"
"What-what, what-what, what would I do?"

[Verse 3]
Invincible, lyrical, miracle man, huh
Uh, but back to the matter at hand
Cause 10 years ago we all strived to be 25
Some cats didn't make it alive
Dated some stars but respect their privacy
Copped mad cars, layin' back in the driver's seat
Held myself down, just steerin' the wheel
Here I am, completed my whole record deal

[Chorus: Nipsey Russell]
"What-what, what-what, what would I do?"
"What-what, what-what, what would I do?"
"What-what, what-what, what would I do?"
"What-what, what-what, what would I do?"

[Outro]
What would I do
If I could reach inside of me
And to know how it feels
To say I like what I see?

[45 seconds of talking/skit]

[Verse 1]
It was a murder
Jake just hit the corner people swarming
Three in the morning I jumped out my cab like "Fuck
Niggas is buck," mega bloodshed, the tape's red
I heard some bird whisper, "Yo he should have ducked"
I puffed the lila, just before I hit the scene for rilla, I'm all high
It's late I'm looking down at the fella
Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion
His mom's had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk
It hurt, kind of took it as a brief reminder
That the street's designed to stop your life clock
The beast'll time ya, cell to cell, suspect ass nigga you fail
First time locked in Comstock, my mind blocks the frail
Bursting, blasting at your forty cal shell, split your dry cell
My niggas never snitch why tell
We roll with no regrets, destinies, fiftys and equities
Queens'll be the death of me

[Chorus]
To the suspect witness: don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
(Suspect witness don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight)
Suspect witness: don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
(Suspect witness don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight)

[Verse 2]
Dear God, I want the riches, money hungry bitches infested
Giving the jealous niggas sickness to witness
My crew dresses in vests, feel the essence
Try to test this scientist, able and reckless, slaughter
Nautica Down, frames look petite
Ten millis, minks designed just for my physique
I keep a low pro as if I owe, bless the flow lovely
My pants hang while I'm dancing, sipping the bubbly
Hey, me no worry, hashish keep my eyes Chinese
Roll the two Phillies together, make blunts Siamese
I meant it, I represent it, descendant made of
Early natives that were captured and taught to think backwards
Trapped us in a cracker's psychiatric, it's massive
A Million Man March, alert the masses
Tan Clarks, Armani in small print upon my glasses
Don assassins, Armageddon
The wedding of a freak and a beast
Seven heads, got the righteous threatened
Life Was Written, the plot curves behind the settin'
Comprehend the grammar, Math we own
Are you the type of nigga to shoot a leg to get your name known?
I flip the brain tone, niggas get hit and wrapped in plastic
The mic I strike in vain, givin' the pain of what a MAC is
What you with, lucci or drama?
No sleep means insomnia
No need to check the clock, the streets'll time ya

[Chorus]
Suspect witness: don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
(Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah
It justifies Nas Escobar's leavin' shit mesmerized
Mega live, like the third world
Decipher my deceiver make him a believer
Spitting gem stars, words in my mic type receiver
Bond is my life so I live by my word
Never fraudulent Queensbridge don't make no herbs
Spread my name to deacons, politicians while they speakin'
Rebel to America civilization, caught you sleepin'

[Outro]
(Queensbridge, boy, once again, boy
Recognize boy, recognize, stupid motherfuckers)
Street educated, created
Fly gangsta, Firm style
AZ, what up, what up?
Jungle, Benny Blanco from the Bridge
Mega, Big Hi, clap 'em down
L.E.S. on a murder quest, yeah yeah y'all



[Produced By: Live Squad, Lo Ground & Top General Sounds]

[Chorus]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I never brag how real I keep it, 'cause it's the best secret
I rock a vest prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus
In a Lex watching Kathie Lee and Regis
My actions are one with the seasons
A TEC squeezing executioner
Winter time I rock a fur
Mega popular center of attraction
Climaxing, my bitches, they be laughing
They high from sniffing coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson
City lights spark a New York night
Rossi and Martini sipping, Sergio Tacchini
Flipping mad pies, low price
I blow dice and throw them
.45 by my scrotum, manifest the Do or Die slogan
My niggas roll in ten M3's
Twenty Gods popping wheelies on Kawasakis
Hip hop's got me on some ol', spraying shots like a drum roll
Blanking out and never miscount the shells my gun hold
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I separate, watching crab niggas marinate
I'm all about TECs, a good jux and sex
Israelite books, holding government names from Ness
Emcees are crawling out every hole in the slum
You be a'ight like blood money in a pimp's cum

[Chorus]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's

[Verse 2]
Currency is made in the trust of the Messiah
I'm spending it to get higher
Earth, Wind and Fire singing Reasons why I'm
Up early, trustworthy is a nine that bust early
Sunshine on my grill, I spill Remy on imaginary graves
Put my hat on my waves, latter Day Saints say religious praise
I dolo, challenge any team or solo
You must be bugging out, new to my shit, home on a furlough
Ask around who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, getting niggas' wakes sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life's predicted by a gypsy
I'll one day walk into shots, drunk off champagne from Sicily
This be the drama, I'ma pause like a comma
In a sentence, paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes high, yellow envelopes of lye
Opening cigars let tobacco fly
Condos are tune-proof, we're looking out the sky's moonroof
Shitting like gin and prune juice
Yo the system wants the coon's noose, hang 'em high
Courtrooms filled up, it's off the hook while I
Just wrote a statement, like I'm facing twenty years
In the basement, chilling on the VI with Mumia
For wearing chrome, I told the judge snakes slither
Like Sharon Stone but like Capone I'm thrown, yo

[Chorus]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's

[Verse 3]
Yo, the time is wasting, I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacing, court pen pacing
Individual, lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation
We living in dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives
A lifestyle on bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real McCoy dope fiend named Detroit is still dealing boy
Coke suppliers acting biased
'Cause rumors say that niggas wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani's
Just a killer in me, slash drug dealer MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler
Demi, bottles of Mo', yo simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
Rough hoes pull crack out pussies and buttholes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it when you could be about it
My degrees are routed, toward the peasy haired brick houses
And studded-up, thick medallions
Rich niggas transport in thousands
Foreign cash exchange amounting to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped, watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catching mad feelings
Peeling off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheeling
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggas with the TECs you blessed, word
So now it's on, never wasted a slug
Time is money when it comes to mine, take it in blood

[Chorus]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's

[Outro]
Yea, Capone-n-Noreaga
Yeah yo offical Queensbridge murderers
Mobb Deep keep it real though
Motherfucking AZ yo
Mega, Mega, whatever
Scarlett O'Hara, Fox Boogie
East New York
Yambo, Brownsville
Wizard, Far Rockaway
Big Bow, Jersey
Connecticut, DC, Sudan
VA, NC, LA
So on and so on
Big Ha, Houston Fifth Ward
Black Ed, keep it real Moe



[Intro]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that

[Chorus]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
(Street rules and jewels'll help teach a hungry crew)
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For, you wack MC's!
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
(In a world of the monkey-see, monkey-do)
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For, you wack MC's!
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
(In a world of the monkey-see, monkey-do)
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For, you wack MC's!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
Italiano model, trained like Cus D'Amato
Guard ya plan, recline low, black Milano
Bless God, feelin' Kosher
One in the top of the toaster, proper ghost ya
My gun is cocked in the holster, dumped quick
Chasin' my dick made a bum bitch rich, stylish
Heard ya naked in jail flicks
Mama cita, Black Widow, Turner be a back seater
Satin pillows, a pimpstress in willow
Cookin' my blow and head slow, eyes swellin'
Disorder the grain, I gotta split my wife melon
So I can see the seven seas of my circumference
[?], polishin' pistols like a gunsmith
Clever, my mama told me, "Take cheddar
By slugs and drugs, whatever calculate better"
When cake's measured, lock the front door, secure
See the gleamin' white crystal when it's pure

[Chorus]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
(Street rules and jewels'll help teach a hungry crew)
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For, you wack MC's!
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
(In a world of the monkey-see, monkey-do)
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For, you wack MC's!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
Fuck the snake hoes
And jealous ass niggas that smash your Benz windows
Detectin' fake nigga signals
Yo, live niggas get it, too
Scarin' rappers like the Fed time Gotti was acquitted to
Blood-shot red eyes, high, yellow envelopes of lye
Openin' cigars, let tobacco fly
Kicks matchin' my shit, my gun on
Thinkin' a name for my man's unborn, spillin' Puerto Rican rum on Imaginary graves, put my hat on my waves
Latter Day Saints, scream religious praise
Heat graze the baby, yo, foul shit made a welfare mom crazy
Mo' bodies drop by the ratio, paces blow
Grizzly thoughts for makin' dough
Haitian bitch cast a spell on my life for cash-flow
So, now it's on, never wasted a slug
Time is money, when it comes to mine, take it in blood

[Chorus]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
(Street rules and jewels'll help teach a hungry crew)
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For, you wack MC's!
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
(In a world of the monkey-see, monkey-do)
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For, you wack MC's!

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, foggy and shit, trees lit up everywhere
It's like that there, yanahmean?
Executive class material
Most official Queens representative on the motherfuckin' joint
This is how it's goin' down
Sun-up to sun-down, put ya gun down



Da ha
Da ha ha ha ha ha
Da ha ha ha
Da ha ha ha ha ha

[Verse 1]
It was '87
Crack money was "Ghetto Heaven"
Niggas gettin' it
Every block rise to perfection
Green tops, boulders and bottles
Soldiers who follow leaders
You owed 'em dollars
Know that tommorrow you might not see it
Packs got knocked off by sprinklers that never worked
All the way to the monkey bars, cross that line you got murked
That's other niggas territory had fiends in the cheese line
They told them fiends calm down, ten dollars each dime
They never scared of Po-Po, was only one patrol car
They wasn't up for crack and I was up on the chin of Pa
Watching hustlers with tinted cars, money makin'
But one kid was into takin'
Had dreadlocks wasn't Jamaican
Fort green he laid
First nigga I ever saw rockin' dreads with a fade
Lead he sprayed on the corners in my hood
Dodgin' and runnin'
The glare in his eyes told you somethin' was commin'
They went to war, Godbless Rita, got shot by mistake
Niggas got knocked by them Jakes
Homicide suit and tie cops, Mayor Koch, screams in rage
Niggas so thugs got pits rocking thick chains
Stick-up niggas so thug they got pits with sick names
Clicks got bigger, extortion cats wasn't hearin' it
But he was regulatin'
A ghetto king, now he levatatin'
They say he smiled in his casket
This ends the first chapter of another Nas classic

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Tales from the hood, trails of blood
But it's all good, try to stay alive like we all should

[Verse 2]
Yeah I'mma help you nigga, cause I see evil's callin' you
Sick thoughts make you wanna take Ki's from other ballin' crews
Top of the world's all he views
A puff of weed, nothing but greed don't live by the rules
Fuckin' wit' me here's what I do
Try to sell your freedom I'm accustomed to
You could ball wit' me or get arrested too
It's easy to land where they dwell with the greasy hands
Twenty to L' what's your plan take your grams
You bought you a Lexus, BBS spendin' Abrahams
Never learned your lesson, choose the right direction
Thin line from life and death and my man checked in
A motel, same one as a young G he know well
Crossed 'em on a coke sell then went on a run
But shorty got his old folks killed, yo he got 'em done
Nobody to run to, what succumb to
My nigga just wanted to eat, now he hunted on the street

[Hook]
Tales from the hood, trails of blood
Yeah it's all good, try to stay alive like we all should
Tales from the hood, trails of blood
Though it's all good, try to stay alive like we all should

[Verse 3]
Little Gotti got down for his, let off seven rounds
The kid he hit is heaven bound if he's on the good list
Shorty who shot 'em ran knowing niggas would snitch
Five years passed he ain't been in the hood since
Shot this nigga over a hundred dollars, money, had borrowed
Time passed, on his birthday he couldn't afford a bottle
Least expected to see 'em, then he asked for his
Nigga said he don't got it, so he blast the kid
Escapes the scene, but he couldn't escape the dream
Or how the kid fell when bullets made it too late to scream
Seeing money's face starin' at him
In black space feelin' hands touchin' him
Wake up it got too much for him
Once liked to be alone
Until he started hearin' groans and seein' things
Now it's time to go home
Niggas shocked to see him
Gave him respect what he was missin'
All the way from VA his aunt yell "He hate to listen"
So he popped up, they gave him hugs, showed him love
Then he was reminded of that night when he sprayed all them slugs
He hangin' like nuttin' happened, police grabbed him up
Now he seein' ghosts in the cell, they got him strapped up
Psycho ward, rest of his life injected thorazine
Haunted memories in his mind of the murder scene

[Hook]
Tales from the hood, trails of blood
The book of the dead, translated in thug language, understood?
Tales from the hood, trails of blood
The book of the dead, translated in thug language, you understood



Yo

[Verse 1:]
Yo
The trains are New York Veins
The cities a cycle
People are the blood stream
Mean and ice cold
Laid back
Counter clockwise
The dice roll
Yank hats
Gang flags
Plane crash
Ground Zero
No lost angels
Ain't you from my from my man's and them area?
It's good to meet you
Ya man did 20 years for some FILA sneakers right
True
Had the 560 benz
Light blue
Where ed shot himself in the stomach
Smoke the dust
He let the culture culture bust
Back when we took the D train uptown
Shante and her whole crew
Groovy hair style
Yo baby yo baby yo t-shirts
Gold teeth smirks
At mark 125th
Hope the heat work
Few numbers I bagged
Then caught a cab back
To Jamaica Ave by the library
Seen the part of shabazz

[Hook:]
New New York New York York York
(all to those who live in Queens know just what I"m talking)
New New York New York York York
(all to those who live in Brooklyn know just what I'm talking)
New New York New York York York
(all to those that live in Harlem know just what I'm talking)
New New York New York York York
(all to those from South Bronx know just what I'm talking)

[Verse 2:]
Skate Key
Empire USA
Rooftop
2 O'clock
Skates off break north
To the rink
Minks
Springfield in Newark
The 6 borough Jerz
Car jack city
The GW bridge
The Coop City
Popo's hot
Glocks in your Benzy box
Stash
And we move fast
Dropped off Miss Pretty
Shakes her ass to the building
Knowing I just killed it
Dudes in front of her door blocks her entrance
Asking her "who she been with?"
She laughs "mind ya business"
Tinted windows
Pop dutches with box cutters
Drop brothers off at comstock to see locked brothers
Hick town up in New York State
Jakes
Hate a black New York face
Jumping out the phantom with the Baps
Planet of the Apes
With the hammers on her waist
Gorillas in the tristate of

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
It dont matter if I been out of town
Cigar lounge
Doing rounds of tequila
Soon as I touch down
In NYC streets
The heat is on
The Talk
Who said what
I catch up on
The New Teflon Don
Who got they death bond
Who still stable
Where beef got squash at the round table
Who still holding it
Who hanging with snitches
Couple of Zulu's from back in the days who still up in clinton
No more hand shakes fake arm swing
See if your flinching
Need to hold something thats mention in every nigga sentence
When I get it you got it
D's went up in the project
Bail a couple of homies out
No doubt
Ferrari's in the summer
When its the hummer
Or the turtle top band satellite
Spilling drinks
Hitting potholes with savage types
Club 17 marque
The team flash
Next day hit the spas and the steam bath
Knock out this business
Do some promo
Make paper in the grind capital
Sign a graph then hit the hood
See the folks reminisce on how it was

In the most powerful city that i love NEW YORK



[Chorus]
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

[Verse 1]
Truck jewels, big stacks, mustard boots
Construction on her feet, she eat duck confit
I shoot up the club whenever I hit it raw
If she have a baby by me, I'ma love her more
Brings food to the crib when I'm laying low
And she know how to roll weed, but don't smoke
Chinese massages, wifey, no side-chick
Go sight-seeing with the god
Playing cards with my dad, frying chicken for the mob
Simply Lemonade, raspberry for the wash, gosh
She know who tryin' to rock her to sleep to get to me
Give 'em the side eye when she see 'em in the street
Her brother locked up, he doin' ten up in the beast
He's short, he comin' home and she hyped for his release
Fly her to Hollywood, watch flicks from Nollywood
Like hydraulics, she ride the wood

[Chorus]
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

[Verse 2]
She edu-ma-cated, she said she related to the Asian
Ethic persuasion, the sex is amazin'
Never bought her a Birkin, my night-time nurse
May be more like a surgeon, nice on the eyes, I put that work in
Back when she was on the same block that I would service
Said, "It's straight," we need a place up in Jamaica Estates
And she was like, "Oh no" in a silky Kimono
Said the streets, the snakes, plus Governor Cuomo
Flashes out the window, people takin' my photo
She knew I wasn't gon' be no husband, I be a no-show
Leave her standin' at the altar, bro, I couldn't falter
Plus that Nigerian blood mixed in her culture
Body like she Evel Knievel, on the soul cycle
Lookin' like Janet, dance like Michael
She knew I wasn't cut from the cloth to be a Czar
Now she hit the town with the legal Escobar, she's my

[Chorus]
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

[Verse 3]
We fresh outta the Met Gala, express power
Exude the essence of best-dressed for the next hour
Toast glasses, velvet ropes, no trespassin'
Hella smoke, our section has the best fashion
Picture us laughin', how ticklish the money has us
Like little kids, but the difference is we'd much rather
Be ghost, back in the crib, some avocado toast
Laid-back, we choose that over Amalfi Coast
Chillin', startin' to think about children
And bringin' 'em in the world with Kim Jong illin'
But since I'm feelin' what I'm feelin' and she feelin' what she feelin'
I'm willin', she's willin', we buildin'
Every man originated in Asia
One continent, Africa was a part of Asia
Here we are, in this Western Civilization
I believe that we was destined to make it

[Chorus]
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

Don't hurt nuttin..

[Hook]
A teenage thug (you can't tell them shit)
A teenage thug (nigga just chasin his dick)
A teenage thug (he want the world to recognize)
A teenage thug (he's a man now, fuck his size)
A teenage thug (can't stop him, they on the rise)
A teenage thug (the court of law despise)
A teenage thug (wanna fuck and puff lie)
A teenage thug

[Nas]
Dreams of bein a doctor will deteriorate
Takin over the underworld was a clearer fate
Luxury cars, a hundred girls at my face
Laced the name brand, had my game plan mapped out
Lost respect for those cracked out
Most of my elders were failures
To the poison that killed Len Bias from bein Celtic
The later I would hang, the greater my slang
It took my english, replaced it with game
Only cared about, sneakers and two-two bullets
Influenced by the hood, wasn't scared to pull it
Dared to do what I would
First blunt they passed me tasted nasty
Then overwhelmed in the spell the blunt had me
Eyes red, pants saggin
My first dime cut me off for braggin
That we was home alone tappin
Experimentin liquors, doin mixes, feelin sicker
Finish the Henn, throw the bottle, hope it hit ya

[Nas]
Blacked out, I can't see shit sober, not the least bit
Hold your head little man, y'all can't tell me shit
Try to knock the pants off shorty, my hair just cut
My Timbs just bought, the chain I sport I floss
Thugs walkin through the block party, hands on my drawers
Poppin cham' corks, posin like the man of New York
Talk to this hottie with my niggas who quick to blast you
If you old cats, to these niggas, they harass you

[Millenium Thug]
Hey yo cuz, growin up, I almost shattered my plans
Some might say, I'm young at heart, but I'm a grown-ass man
Givin food to my fam, damn, remember the first time
A street thug showed me how to pitch dimes
Only twelve in this hell where kids die
I want bricks off the scale and just slide, and let my shit fly
My Range shift by, I peel the road up
With my shirt up, sweatin, with the ice restin on my chest
Wild as a teenage thug

[Hook]

[Millenium Thug]
Livin and lovin this life, cap peel pump niggas
And since these thugs is trife, give 'em dap for that
Yo where your mack at? I got mine
Twist weed pop wine shift finds, at the end of the night, it's all fine
Livin and lovin, cash stack cousin
Yo' own fam blitz so quick, put clips through whips
Six type shit let you hold it, ice roll with
Twenty below with gat golden, my hand look swollen
Under my glove shit rocky
Unless somebody in my life try to stop me, get popped papi
A breddern, straight to the head that my medicine
No fam of mine do time, we crime settlin
Deliverancy unbelivable, Na'shon tracks smash people
I chill up in the regal Eagle
And plus it clap happy all of them hoes that's born happy
I rip nappy, nature's to cut the roof off of Caddies
You see me?

[Hook w/ variations]

[Intro]
I want to dedicate this song right here
To Jonathan Jackson and George Jackson
Peace to those brothers
I want to shout out my man Sherm the Worm
Eighty years
Come home nigga
Come home, niggas
.. Ugh

[Verse 1]
I just burnt my American flag
And sent three cracker Nazis to hell and I'm sad
Ugh, I'm loading tips in my Mag'
To send these redneck bigots some death in a bag
Choke him out with his confederate flag
I know these devils are mad
Little rap fans who live way out in safe suburbia
Would you stand with me, a United States murdurer?

[Chorus]
(Testifyyyyy for me)
Huh? Would you testify?
You buy my songs
You buy my songs
But will you ride with me?
(Testifyyyyy for me)
You understand my struggle
That's what you claim right?
(Testifyyyyy for me)
Then get your aim right
And get your game tight

[Verse 2]
Don't buy my songs, y'all don't roll with it
Coming to concerts singing ho and shit
Fuck y'all lil' lil' ho bitches
I don't need y'all, I'll go gold with it
I heard y'all was downloading it, heh
Like I'm y'all man who be exposing shit, heh
Like ah, William Cooper
Who told you the Pale Horse is the future

[Chorus]
(Testifyyyyy for me)
Would you testify on some realness like that?
I think you scared (heh)
I don't think you prepared
Yeah
(Testifyyyyy for me)
You know what I'm asking you?
(Testifyyyyy for me)
Do we know what I'm asking you? (hahaha)
Wow...
(Testifyyyyy for me)
Wow...

[Verse 1: Nas]
Fire spitter, I ain't never met a higher nigga
Me extinguished is like Queensbridge fiendless
Mansion, marble foyer
I can afford a closet in alphabet order
A life, Adidas under A, the B for beater, Bottega
British Knights sneaker, my C so ill
That, man, I get chills when I look at my Christian Diors, they kill
D is for Dries Van Noten
Young niggas try to keep up with what I'm doing
D cups, tequila and blunts
Weed, women, and liquor
Depending on the day is a different mission
They not knowing, they wanna know what he got on
The QB Don went and got his Pete Rock on
Nas keep a fine bitch to roll his weed up for him
My niggas in Mount Vernon keep it G'd up for him
Speaking of G, the gat I'm good with it, hit your hood with it
.44s never could miss him, coming to see us
Glad to see you made it home to the hood, nigga
We blowing trees, tell me, don't it feel good, nigga?

[Chorus: J. Myers]
Damn it feels good, it feels good don't it?
La-la-la
Put that good shit in the air (Yeah)
La-la-la
Niggas in the hood don't live forever (My G niggas)
As long as we together (My QB niggas)
We gon' put that good shit in the air (Yeah)
La-la-la

[Verse 2: Nas]
Another bullet manufactured, another man in his casket
Fuck maintaining, that's lame language
Dust to dust, ashes to ashes, I duck quick
Seen fire flashes, the type of fire that spit out a magnum
And I'm the type who runs to the drama looking for who clapping
Nike boot, what I eat him, he like food
Pulled out the barrel
Four-fifths rip through bone marrow
Make his toes spiral the dirt
While his feet kick up rock, he's a sprinter
Police agenda, lock up niggas for three winters
When I attack I'm faceless like a iron mask
They get away quick, traceless, lying back, liars pass
I breathe deep like Lamaze class
Live young, obtain wisdom, and die last
Stretched out or in a body bag, I ain't that
Live young, obtain wisdom, and die last

[Chorus: J. Myers]
Damn it feels good, it feels good don't it?
La-la-la
Put that good shit in the air (Yeah)
La-la-la
Niggas in the hood don't live forever (My G niggas)
As long as we together (My QB niggas)
We gon' put that good shit in the air (Yeah)
La-la-la

[Verse 3: Nas]
Look, I don't have that much time, candidly, I'm in divorce
Rumors, DUIs, in and out of court
Different judges, assault charges hovers on your boy
Other niggas' wives lust to be under covers with your boy
Y'all don't want an angry Nas on your label
Y'all got plenty checks, CEO, man
I'm only 36 but if it's point five on the table
I say with all respect my dude
Thank you, we had the best times but I'm about respect, I'm about the talent I possess
Never know, there could just be a time when I'm behind your desk then let you go
Could you imagine Nas the exec?
The artist on the masters controlling your release
Probably they wanna wait 'til I'm deceased to honor me
So my product'll be a big commodity
Not bothered if my son and daughter eat off of me
Cautiously I write this next line honestly 'cause I'm a G, there's no beef
I used to open off making fifty G's
But now I spend that on a diamond to make her neck freeze
My larynx'll serenade the hood
I tell the cops my blood dirty, they say I'm all good
TMZ, they hoping when the marriage end I'ma turn to Larry Flynt
Nas is not the average gent, I'm on my classy shit
Here's one small percent of what y'all in store to get
More real nigga shit

[Chorus: J. Myers]
Damn it feels good, it feels good don't it?
La-la-la
Put that good shit in the air (Yeah)
La-la-la
Niggas in the hood don't live forever (My G niggas)
As long as we together (My QB niggas)
We gon' put that good shit in the air (Yeah)
La-la-la

[Verse 1]
I pull a string on the lamp and shit darkens
I'm living in an elegant Moroccan apartment
Proletarian chicks sparking
Convo weak and I don't really care for her jargon
Balcony is windy, looking at the stars and
Alky on the Henny, woozy in the head, wobbling
Gucci pillow on the bed, while she giving nogging
Listening and tripping off the Maxwell album
Thinking I should leave to a European island
Bristol and Spain, bring a book about Stalin
Dinner serenaded with a violin
But shorty not qualified to be took to that kind of outing
Gotta be a fly bitch to hang around that fly shit
Fine dining Olive Garden
Nah bitch, Nas is In the real deal
Food spots on the constant
Pick the right wine, a Chianti to wash it
Lifestyle encompasses top-notch watches
Rolexes, synonymous shit I'm copping
Ask her has she been around duffle bags
Full of that fuck you cash
Get off the jet with me in heels, I'll cup your ass
Looking in my eyes saying "Nas, you're one lucky bastard"
Grip your clutch, you'll get finger fucked in the passenger
I hit the dutch, blow smoke out, music and laughter
See us in the coupe flying passed ya

[Verse 2]
Esco, dress code, it changes
Harrods in England
Back to the star spangled labels in my closet hanging
Counting wonder in the Tundra
Get humbled or disgruntled when I come through, confront ya
Let nothing slide, sly remarks, you must wanna die
But you fronting, why? When we all know you pumpkin pie
When we in the bus we fly better shit than Emirates
To Dubai, to the Chi, I'm a crucial conflict
Heaven sent, cause a storm, typhoon flood you out
You are what a thug about, I'm a fucking juggernaut
Never sleep, never tire, keep a freak I tie up
Who don't speak, she quiet
So I can think, conspire
On my feet's a (?), and sometimes sneakers
Wear ties at the Setai Miami
Time-pieces are from Zurich
Its like I'm allergic, to Nonoxynol 9
Give it to you raw so you can feel it



[Intro]
Braveheart...

[Chorus]
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross

[Verse 1]
Y'all can keep y'all weak beats from your corny producers
There's a new king of the streets, you're gonna get used to
I was the old king of the streets, that y'all once hated
But now I reinvented myself, and y'all all waited
NAS, N.A.S. mean Niggas Against Society
Noisy I aim, not silently, noose all surroundin' me
I hang 'em, I string 'em up, ain't no thing, I just drop 'em
To which doctor you copped
And you locked and it ain't what it was
I changed it up from that pop shit, it's hard to see R&B
Rappers arguably, started fuckin' up the game horribly
'Cause I parted the sea, then these novices targeted me
Bitches infatuated say they love me lyin' to me
What I've discovered is my brother's tryin' to be
The next me, yeah I support him, but he's blinded I see
Jealousy, he love me to death and I'm buggin'
I love him for life, we both still mournin' on our mother's life
And I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to fuck
A six, a truck, some guns to bust
I wish it was that simple, the last emperor, hit yo' ass
With the Nasty Nas diary, get out my path

[Chorus]
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary would've an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross

[Verse 2]
I can't keep a bitch 'cause none of them come before little Des
I can't be too rich, too many hoes lined up for sex
I can't rest until my niggas in houses with pretty mazes
Water and flowers in 'em
While my niggas walk around in they trousers grinnin'
Gotta keep a lot of heat; .30 cals, 10 millimeters
.40 cals plus the Heckler to set y'all straight
You too light? I shoot your freckles out
You too dark? The infrared show you what the TEC about
Huh? I'm stressin' out, need more offices for bosses
Secretaries and meetings with big sharks who mad greedy
We can sell mo' boats on the coast
Give coats to the po', and give hope to the broke, then live low
But that ain't reality; I look happy, but under the sky
You see a nigga who know, out of three women two out of three
Will love you but lead you to they own hidden evil
Bitch! You the reason niggas be beefin', ho get on
'Posed to be Earth, ain't worth the pussy that you sit on
From here on it's a new day
Million dollars ain't what it was yesterday
Many problems, many niggas, most involved but they fake
Hope y'all relate

[Chorus]
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross, I carry the cross

[Intro: Super Cat]
He's the heartbeat of the people
The ghetto people, and when I say ghetto people
The people who cannot afford to go to big concert
Some of these people do not even have TV, so they can't afford cable
Some of them can afford a radio
So the only thing they can listen to is the music
People the ghetto, people from the projects, street people
Hortical ghetto youth who know what it is to sing about suffering and reality

[Sample from "Dance Inna New York" by Super Cat]
New York girl, dem a mad over we

[Verse 1: Nas]
Smoking a escubano, guzzle my second bottle
Hope I don't catch a homo
Grossing our net, simultaneously making me climb higher
Heinous crimes behind me, search but can't find me, fuck sadness
Had this been you having this lavish
Habitual happiness, at me you wouldnt look backwards
You would have sex on condominium roof decks
So anyone move next, I'll hit you with two TECs
Rocking Roberto Cavalli, no shirt on, convertible Mazi
My Colombiana mommy riding beside me
Every tat mean something, thats my word on my body
Ill have to lean something with that Mossberg shotty
My niggas is ignant, put lead in your pigment
Just 'cause y'all was mad at all the years I was getting it
In '97 the six, '98 the Bentley
Now its the Ghost Phantom, and y'all can't stand him but

[Chorus: Super Cat sample (Nas)]
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don, dance

[Verse 2: Nas]
Army jacket swag, army jacket green and black
With the square top pocket that snaps
Where the gas at?
Pass that, not you, you hold cracks in your ass crack
I never did that, my sock's where my stash was at
Yo, I used to listen to that Red Alert and Rap Attack
I fell in love with all that poetry I mastered that
Cutting school where Preme team and Fat Cat was at
Future not crystal clear yet, Baccarat
Now I'm the one who repping Queens
Way beyond your wildest dreams
Bottles on bottles with sparklers surround my team
That long cash get the baddest bitches out they jeans
Twenty years in this game, looking seventeen
I don't lean: no codeine, promethazine
I just blow green, pick which bitch to bless the king
Although hes on to another chapter
Heavy D gave this beat to Salaam for me to rap to, raaaahhh

Yeah, yeah
New York is like an Island, a big Rikers Island
The cops be out wilding, all I hear is sirens
It's all about surviving
Same old two-step, try to stay alive when they be out robbing
I been out rhyming since born knowledge
Like prophet Muhammad said the ink from a scholar
Worth more than the blood of a martyr, so I'ma
Keep it on 'til I see a billion dollars
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Love model chocha, mommy pop it like she 'pose to
Eyes red shot like I'm never sober
Big time smoker, Indonesian doja
Mini me's you can hold up
Before you end up wet up from my soldier
Don shit, under fire I remain on some calm shit
This for every ghetto in the hood
Nas the Don, Super Cat the Don Dada, understood

Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don, dance
Inna New York City-city, New York City-city
New York City-city, New York City-city, New York...







Honies, cash, weed, cars
Ghetto celebrities, hood movie stars
Gat slingers now rap singers are who we are
Went from Nasty to Nas, to Nas to Escobar

The path we all walk, starts out long it's like a boardwalk
Monopoly, some make it around, some go down, it's prophecy
Happy days balancing with life's atrocities
Hoppin' in V's, knowin' some day I got to lead properly

High up in a five realizing the price paid
For this life laid in the light shade
One might say, top of the world's two whips, a crib and a girl
Quick to celebrate it, poppin' corks like they made it

Pretentious, arrogant niggas is senseless
Pro-ball players with white wives, peep they night lives
While you could catch me in a crisp white five
Dark tinted, dijon-scented, with Al Green on, my theme song
Love and happiness, how can it seem wrong?

I mean before this, I used to rock a taurus with the donuts
Now I grown up, got it chromed up
Got the rap game sewn up, sho-nuff
Niggas acting cool but it's really no love
I feel a slow buzz, off the dutch

This is everyday, every second
Got to make it pay, every lesson I learnt
Got me open while most of these rappers'll stay burnt

Honies, cash, weed, cars
Ghetto celebrities, hood movie stars
Gat slingers now rap singers are who we are
Went from Nasty to Nas, to Nas to Escobar

Money, cash, weed, cars
Ghetto celebrities, hood movie stars
Gat slingers now rap singers are who we are
Went from Nasty to Nas, to Nas to Escobar

With so much drama in QBC
It's kinda hard being Escobarro
Elderado Red, sippin' Dom out the bottle
My life is like a Donald Goines novel
We wave glasses like bravo

Drunk niggas with mad problems, and shot pockets
My niggas from the block rock this
Box cocaine, cook it and chop it

Looking to profit, in different ways
Goin' through this difficult stage, called life
But each year my physical's praised

Some fell beyond the reach of help
Cut in the street, thinkin' they could teach theyself
When all we wanted was a piece of wealth
And randomly, feed our family, the streets are insanity

Amply, living in this thug's fantasy
Richest nigga in show biz is what I plan to be
Heavy chain and my QB sway, living this king's life
Magazines write about me, in this dream it's all tight

Honies, cash, weed, cars
Ghetto celebrities, hood movie stars
Gat slingers now rap singers are who we are
Went from Nasty to Nas, to Nas to Escobar

Money, cash, weed, cars
Ghetto celebrities, hood movie stars
Gat slingers now rap singers are who we are
Went from Nasty to Nas, to Nas to Escobar

Now the main thing that boggle my brain be all the bottles of pain
Iced the chain and all the followers came
They tried to throw me off track but I caught that
They thought I lost that but I'm continuing to make more stacks

Halftime, New York state of mind, it was written was hittin'
Trips overseas, southeast, diamond and riches
Sleepin' on the plane wake up when we land
Feelin' real scared, on the ground
Rollie flush, princess cuts, and large rounds

The crews up, findin' time to shine rocks
It's real, you violate, be in a pine box
If it go there, I lay you before you lay me, it's crazy
I didn't make the game, the game made me
Records for the babies so they raised up in mansions
Haters keep hating, and ladies'll keep glancing

Y'all know the routine out this [Incomprehensible], word up



[Intro: Nas & AZ]
Yeah
Peace king
Peace king
Listen, if they wrote a book on your life
Right
You think anybody'll read it?
No fuckin' doubt!
Let's make history homie
Aight then
You know we brought the hoes, clothes and money rolls to the table
{*laughing*} No, fuckin', doubt
It's time to manifest this
Tuu, we the flyest nigga
Bring it to a whole, y'know?
Gangsta nigga

[Chorus: Shelene Thomas]
Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome
We the flyest gangsters

[Verse 1: AZ]
Follow; I'm like a Lamborghini green Diablo
Coupe VT, it's like DVD when I flow
Feel me, I'm loved like the great late Malik Sealy
The one the playa haters hate dearly, but can't near me
Homicide can't scare me
I o-bide by the laws of these streets sincerely, a real nigga
The type that can build with ya
Verbalize bring life to a still picture, it's God-given
Been blessed with Allah's vision, strength and beauty
Truly my only duty is to dodge prison
Play with me, I'm modest 'til them strays hit me
Regardless the circumstances I'ma stay filthy
Dough forever, the live stay low forever
And fuck niggas, 'cause it's hard to keep them close together
One dependent, no wife, one co-defendant
No forms of weakness, I flow with vengeance

[Chorus: Shelene Thomas (Nas)]
Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes (hoes)
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome (ha)
We the flyest gangsters

[Verse 2: Nas]
I do what I can do when I can do it
Feel how I feel when I feel what I'm feelin'
Live how I live it's only 'cause I been through it
Learn to try it like to eat it and shit, it's nuttin' to it
Burn it light it weed it and off the liquor, while drivin' outside
I'll never catch a vehicular homicide
My music is a description of my vibe of course
My life, my sites, my thoughts, what I like on my fork
'Cause you are what you eat, you eat what you can
You pray to bless the food but first you wash your hands
To wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home
Once you let them in they stayin', evil be gone, say it
I'm proud of Mase for givin' himself to the Lord
Wonderin' does Faith, think about Big anymore
Of course my nigga Horse got married, see shit is changin'
We ain't these little niggas no more, runnin' dangerous
I like to bone, I'm a peaceful brother
Eat up so much the girls call me seafood lover
Be havin' they legs shakin', stab 'em, break 'em
I'm Hercules Hercules when havin' relations, the flyest

[Chorus: Shelene Thomas (Nas)]
Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow (uhh)
Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes (hoes)
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome (ha)
We the flyest gangsters

[Verse 3: Nas, AZ & Both]
We put this on the, soul of our born, as we hold the Qur'an
Kamikaze style
Older cats coaching us on
Yo, it's kill or be killed
Understand, real'll be real
A forty-shot spectrum make your whole embassy kneel
Identity sealed, protected by our energy shield
And fuck a drop, 'cause that's that shit that got Kennedy killed
Close the book
Was taught never expose a crook
Between the knight and the bishop
One'll knock ya rook
I'm a rare breed, never had a fear to lead
I ain't like niggas with sight, too impaired to read
We both hard hit just like Camacho and Vargas, who's a target?
Now watch how we close the market, motherfuckers

[Chorus: Shelene Thomas]
Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome
We the flyest gangsters

Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like y'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome
We the flyest gangsters

Be jumpin out of movin cars and land at my feet - because [Chorus]x2

Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr. Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was 12, I went to

NAS
"Get-get.. get down!"

New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the 70's
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned well he asked me
"What you up to, the cops goin' bust you"
I was a teen drunk off brew, stumbled I wondered
If God sent him, cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us, I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple, I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls
Showin' they little cooch, gangstas don't die he's livin' proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother durin' the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is bein' replaced
Pre-trial hearin' is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I want to crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for black power, cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, nobody leavin' everybody

[Chorus]
"Get down, get down! Get down, get down!" [Repeats]
Everybody
"Get down, get down! Get down, get down!"

[Nas]
Some niggas fuck they enemies in they ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas are dangerous, so don't test 'em
They make you, disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of they car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto heron blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck, I turned to punch them
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangstas, we loungin', out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dawg from Pelican Bay
The letter say, "Nas I got your back - the fools don't play"
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho responsible
The nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and things
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'ma mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Should of never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room do', to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner, on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do, with all the drama
Cause I was with a crew, that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you
He responded cool, but told me out here this how motherfuckers

[Chorus]
All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people goin' get down, how we ever goin' get up?
How we ever goin' get up if that's how we get down?
A shame when you ain't look at it
My folk is yo' folk, but we all kinfolk
Somebody gotta make a change



[Orchestral Intro]

Turn my mike up, yes
So good to be here with you!
Yes

[Nas]
Nas too real, Nas true king

[Spoken: Nas]
This feels good right here
You look good out here



I came from the city
Yeah, got my name from the city
Where? The most dangerous city
Let's take a trip back, back into time
1977, it was maximum crime
The President neglected us, him and 6 masterminds
6 powerful men put New York through some drastic times
The rich and selfish ones, feed off the welfare ones
And which borough suffered the worst? Hmm, where I'm from
The Bronx
We had to rumble with rivals on the rubble
While buildings around us would crumble
I dreamed right but it seemed like nothin' found me but trouble
I see the light, it's right there at the end of the tunnel
Had to find my rope, to pull me up
Cause I needed some kind of hope, to fill me up
'Til I met one guy, took me under the wing
I could have died if this man ain't intervene
He was an orphan, my savior, free spirited
No man braver, he was honored and gifted
His name was Shaolin Fantastic, the lady-killin' romantic
Can't forget the day we met, and this story recants it
But yo my life began last year, sophomore of high school
That summer I saw her, said to myself, "She'll be my wife soon"



Click, BOOM!, that's what I heard
Things crash

Listen up to what my soul conjures up
My tear ducts dry, can't cry, I conceal it, I die
My index finger and thumb push the pin to the drum
You ask where I've been, New York City, BX where I'm from
No figment of my imagination, sad situation for my dad
Killer came in my pad and started sprayin'
Father layin' on the floor, he breathin' no more
Shot to death, the reaper came like a thief through the door
Shaolin, he helps me, he wealthy in street knowledge
He deep in the path of drug dealin' and violence
Day in and day out, drama, we couldn't stay out
Livin' in my aunt's house, music the only way out
Cause we was in the broke down belly
Of a hungry beast
We stayed true, then we made up a crew
Shaolin gave me the name Book, I became a ragin' bull
Back when I was first enchanted by Grandmaster Flash
You had to be there, imagine him scratchin' wax
Up in his habitat in the Bronx, he got it on
The birth of a new group has spawned



Now on July 13th, 1977
The blackout, streets is lookin' like Armageddon
Swelterin' heat, suffocate in this Hell within' the 5 boroughs
It's like the Sun roastin' the Earth
The hood was called turf, my girl was thrown out of her church
Out of her home, and by her family, she's disowned

She's the love of my life, up to us to go on
And everything's burnin', buildings illuminated by the fire
And the city was lost, we tryna save it, the cross
The Star of David we lost
We started prayin' to governor, he a gangster
In cahoots with the mayor, the roof startin' to cave in
No, it's not a game, all is dark except the flame
Now nothin' will be the same
Now the whole world's changed
Music is soundin' different
Radio stations don't pump us up in their mix yet
Disco still gettin' that air time for big checks

Yo, somethin' gotta give
And somethin' gotta die so somethin' new can live



[Intro]
The G-O-D
Ayo, check it out, it's God's Son
I know I always give you clowns a little lane to come out
'Cause I drop every two years, but it's over now, you know? Hah

[Bridge]
Is it because I got the city on smash now
Oh woe woe
Or is it because your time's up and it's a wrap now
Hey hey hey hey

[Verse 1]
In the papers you read that Nas is crazy
Lost his mind as he leavin' Sony
The INC got him signed
It's only a figment of your imagination
Went to way with New York's Hot radio station
Lost my patience, had to Zone Out
Rappers blown out, I have the throne now
The real shall reign, I feel your pain
You too R&B, follow me, spell my name

[Chorus]
The G-O-D S-O-N
K-I-N-G O-F N-Y-C

That's me

[Bridge]
Is it because I got the city on smash now
Oh woe woe
Or is it because your time's up and it's a wrap now
Hey hey hey hey

[Verse 2]
God's Son across the belly
Pardon, I'm hardly a bully
But what y'all done to hip hop is scary
Nas'll be truly the, last soldier to roll with
Holdin it down, my proteges are over with now
A producer like Swizz Beatz, on fire
So is the control room, soon as my vocals are down
Nas - God's Son, and y'all my little children
So bounce with it, if you can pronounce the correct spellin'

[Chorus]
The G-O-D S-O-N
K-I-N-G O-F N-Y-C

[Intro]
One, two
Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do
{*rewind*}
One, two
Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do
Check, one, two

[Verse 1]
Yo I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit
On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot
Rats drink from water drops, in the streets niggas
Little kids scared cops, wit red dots
Philosophical gangsta, wit violent priors
Goin' back like black and white TV's wit pliers
Leanin' on broke down cars, wit flat tires
Flash iron, anybody tryin' on, the blocks I'm supplyin' on
Madicon, my peeps, tie ballons up
And swallow 'em and the P now got goons, lots of 'em
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of
Martyr, hood haunted like the Dakota
Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace
He begged for freedom, hanged wit wild Jamicians
From Kingston, who drink Irish Malts
Listenin to Peter Winston, Machintosh
Lightning hits the top of the church steeple
When I'm writin', semi-automatic no hyphen
It's frightening.... {*scratches*}

[Hook]
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit

[Verse 2]
I take summers off, cause I love winter beef
Started '87, wit the shotty in the sheep
Three-quarter length beige, dressed to kill
Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd
Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth
Woolrich, Carhartt, gun powder stains
Smellin' like trees, sensimille on the brain
Skeemin' on ya girls, bambooze or ya chain
Got ill up on the train, twistin' off a cap
Of a English in my vain, might of pushed you on the tracks
Deaf crack fiends, who can't speak, scream noises
Cause she bought a jum of soap, from one of my boys and, it's
.... Just another day in the hood
And I'm, wit some wild brothers, up to no good
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em
But our style was let them pile then, we robbin' 'em
Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes
Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino goin'
And I had to make a song, speakin on my old life
For the thief's who come out at night

[Hook]

[Outro]
One, two
Check, one, two {*echoes*}
One, two
Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do {*echoes*}
{*explosion*}



[Hook]
I know you think you got it together player, but fuck the bird you with
And listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
Listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
There's always one thing wrong and you wish that you could switch
Or fix, while you shapin' every curve and hips, you heard of this?
The makings of a perfect bitch

[Nas]
A ghoul at night, I role like Jack the Ripper trying to choose my wife
I need a ass of a stripper, fat lipper
Mad niggas in this one predicament
You try to choose a loyal one and stick with it
My stupid dick again searching for something to jump and then start humpin'
Convincing me that the history of a woman is about leaving a nigga with nothing
So my experiences taught me how to come up with a plan to make a right one for the man
A toy for the boy, the one that righteously will understand
And since I can't find her I guess I gotta make her
I creep in the night like a kinky undertaker
I think I'm on a caper to abduct a nerd from the Ivy League
Next stop at the strip club snatch a bad one and flee
What's next, I'm stakin' out a five star restaurant to kidnap the chef
Say goodbye to the stress

[Hook]

[Nas]
I stitch 'em together then I kiss 'em forever
These surgical gloves are made of love, couldn't be better
Four cycles of blood, child birth first
Men-e-stral cycle, last men-e-stral cycle then death
That's four, so I guess rebirth is the fifth
Put 'em together, that's a genius, a slut and a chef
Holdin' the scalpel while cutting the flesh
Heavy bleeding, so I need suction, it's such a mess
If she survives she'll be sucking me next
Dark nipples on her D-cup breasts so I could titty fuck while she do
My taxes for the IRS
So I could just relax, shit, by now I'm blessed
I'm her daddy, I'm her messiah, I'm god
Cause I injected obedience and loyalty in her heart
Know you mad cause you with a bitch that nag you to death
I smack mine on the ass and she breathe her first breath

[Hook]

[Nas]
Gimme Sade's mystique, she gotta know her way in the streets
Like Billie Holiday in Harlem
Body from Ki Toy Johnson and Kenya Moore and Apple Bottoms
Maya Angelou's brain and some groove from Terry McMillan
Them Angelina Jolie lips, Angela Davis, Sista Souljah's wit
Helping me load clips
Some words form a pimp was, "Nas, it just don't exist"
But homes is twisted, a home ain't a home without without the misses
All the girls that I named are queens, no disrespect
But I need me someone to disappear, reappear like I dream of Jeannie
Whenever I want, I think I met her, it's on, forever I'll flaunt

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Fake thug, no love, you get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Z make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes
32 shotguns, regulate with my dunns
17 rocks gleam from one ring
They let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style, roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on millenniums
20 G bets I'm winnin' 'em, threats I'm sendin' 'em
Lex with TV sets the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains, a case of Demi-Sec
To chase the Henny, wet any clique with the semi TEC
Who want it? Diamonds I flaunt it
Chickenheads flock I lace 'em, fried broiled with basil taste 'em
Crack the legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon?
Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC that won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

[Refrain]
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'

[Verse 2]
I peeped you frontin'
I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89
Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9, that nigga grave be mine
Clanked himwhat was he thinkin'?
On my corner when it's pay-me time
Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin
Somethin' told me "Plug him!"
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped, son, caught a hot one
Somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin' me my name
What the fuck? I got stitched up, it went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep watchin'
All he seen speed by was a brown Datsun
And yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' Ls, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin' war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together uptown coppin' the raw
But a thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers, word up

[Refrain 2]
Y'aY'all know my steelo
TherTherTherTherTherThere ain't an army that could strike back
Y'aY'all know my steelo
TherTherTherTherThere ain't an army that could strike back
Y'aY'all know my steelo
TherTherTherThere ain't an army that could strike back
Y'aY'all know my steelo
There ain't an army that could strike back

[Outro: Nas & (AZ)]
Thug niggas, yo, to them thug niggas
Gettin' it on in the world, you know?
To them niggas that's locked down
Doin' they thing, survivin', ya know'm sayin'?
To my thorough niggas, New York and worldwide
Yo, to the Queensbridge Militia
9-6 shit, The Firm clique
Illmatic, nigga, It Was Written though
It's been a long time comin'
Y'all fake niggas, tryin' to copy
Better come with the real though, fake-ass niggas, yo
(They throw us slugs, we throwin' them back, what)
Bring the shit, man! Live, man!
(Fuck that son, word up) 9-6 shit



[Verse 1: Nas]
It's the late night greasy spoon patron, poolhall making
Big bets, midsection got the 8 in
Dior Christian pimping, got that penal system diction
Riffing, you don't want it you snitching
Spit a few at a traitor with that new AR
Try to kill me I'm the leader, that's coup d'etat
Streetsweepers in that Coup all black, bitches want my chipped tooth back
Steel mac, so my kufi never gets smacked
Squeeze a fifth with a grip as I dip from the paparazzi
Still playing numbers you can't stop me
Still wearing bundles and spark weed
If I ever say 'Queens get 'em', you know they got me
Success, scandal, bone deep, personal beef
So lead by example or get trampled
Since Hip Hop is Dead, this is the N
Congratulations in order 'cause we did it again

[Hook: Nas]
Don't hate me now, congratulate me now
I'm still getting it and don't even love the doe
Don't hate me now, congratulate me now
I'm still ripping, and I don't even love the hoes
Still getting it and don't even love the doe
Steel gripping it, you know that I tug the fo'
Stay splifted cause you know that I love the dro

[Verse 2: Nas]
The style is taboo, the chain's offensive
Brain on airplanes, Gucci frames are vintage
The two Tec Don in Yukon's and Benzes
Chicks who suck other chicks tits like infants
The Apprentice but not Trump, I'm the nigga with Glocks and pumps
That you don't see much, sucker free from chumps
Homes with cobblestones in front of 'em
He's got guns in cummerbunds, so understand you under son
Don't make me have you running from a hundred guns
Don't make me grab your only son, I'm coming from
A place Tanqueray and weed's the only escape
From phonies who hate when you rolling with papes
That's why the god party with juicy models
They mob me, the gnarly, Charlie Luciano - hardly
Have to tell y'all, I kill y'all for spitting songs that involve me nigga
Original verbal assassin, have to carve me a nigga

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yo this is Nas, Queens own
Hip Hop Is Dead so put this shit in your vein
Queens Own
Queens Own



[Jessica Care Moore]
Global warming between my legs, screams against the waves
Gave birth to thirteen daughters, so now we never run out of water
My skin layered in diamonds and sage
Left alone in confused forest's, enslaved by days
Time keeps on whorin us
Ghetto saviors can't keep ignorin us
Flowers and flames flew from her fingers
Rifles pointed from her sac
Or was it simply a bag of sticks and stones
Either way, she wore a compass on her head
Rains don't stop the grass from turnin red
Her hair was half permed, half dread
We gave up walking in a past-life and so we danced
Arms wrapped around my breath and choked me back to life
A new world wife, reflecting the sun and rolling dice
Symbol of the drama yet to come - too late to run
Time travelling was late
Watching was a blind man's mistake
All his assets melted right in front of his face
His right leg drabbed with demon pace
Shoes stayed angel laced
Never count your blessings with haste
Even a prophet can catch a case
Didn't realize how sweet the future might taste
Telepathically cutting through mental gates
Words were weapons against their hate
Shepherds search for stars in her hair
Her chest grew fermented like yeast
She broke her body like aged bread
He gave her truth from all the books he'd read
She wrote her poems inside the mud
Sacrificed her cervix to fix the future
Named their poison, spit truth inside his mouth
Read warm prophet, writing twisted scriptures inside her belly
Resurrected from bones and dirt
She made hard niggas smile
Left her seeds inside the Earth
Gave hustlers and killers life's worth
This is the life we chose, remember who was here first
Find a reason why you curse
Gold rushed tongues by dreams too loose
Sporting electronic nooses
Hoeing humanity love takes over lust
Despite the damage to Destiny
You can't take the best of me, In God We Still Trust



[Rich Nice]
What's happening brothers and sisters?
Welcome to our time

[Jessica Care Moore]
Afro-Angels hide my weapons in tangles
Black Star Spangled, fragile like hematite with the East oils I write
Despite the lack of sunlight, got my battle boots tight
Now that the government's gone, can't tell your left from your right
Winged assassins laughin while the New World's collapsing
Mother Earth's ribs crashed in, armed with cowries, I'm blasting
As the Earth rebels my womb swells
The birth of Black Magic, savin my people force of habit
You can't find if you ain't never had it
Spiritually crafted black-listed hair-twisted ghetto embargo lifted
Power-shifting comb-fisting I predict Goddesses you running after witches
I kiss my fourteen stitches
Keep all my baby girl wishes
I predict all the oceans turn dry
Not one baby girl will cry as you attempt to grow broccoli from the desert
We will take our pregnant bodies, drink from underground rivers
Wash your face between our legs
While recreating humanity, we will summon yemanja
Search for our fertility, ban all pink and yellow pills
Ban all pink and yellow pills
I predict killing fields of ghetto armpatch anti-Hatch
Hate groups will be bombed
Childbirth becomes outlawed
Always will be branded numbered and logged
All paper money is gone
Confused scholars can't interpret our scrolls
Your sky has holes
We know the young is old
Nastradamus tell us how the story gets told



[Part 1:]
The Price i Pay To See My Son. And apologies in advance for the typos as I am speaking from the heart as a man who has had enough.
Today i got a call from essence about my ex wife doing another sad fictitious story. Nothing surprises me anymore, including this.
This is what your life has come to sis?
Exploiting some peoples Real struggle and pain...just to get at me....to get attention ? Fame? Another fight against men? We are a human family and we should be better examples for our son. Why is there even a issue for me to have time with my son. A son needs his father. So many absentee fathers out here and here i am being attacked by your accusations simply because i got us in court to help fix this the custody matter?
Why did i have to take you to court to see our son? Why when i win the joint custody ( which is a win for both of us and our son, it helps us with both our schedules) why do you feel thats an attack on you? Is it control ? Why do you need to have control over my life? because were not together? Then why? Is this being rewarded and praised by people who are being taken advantage of by you and your lies?
To all separated couples out there who are cordial and co parent nicely GOOD FOR YOU. I wish that was me. Im the most chill cool parent there is. Who has time to argue ? About what? Its about our little guy. You havent had to deal with what Ive been dealing with. Trust me.
Im a mild mannered god fearing very fair human being who tries his hardest to please everyone. Its my nature.
Ive seen this too many times before
And there was times i thought Kelis my ex wife was not this type. This is the type of antics that deceive people and people mistakenly call it strong. Seems I always had more belief in you than you do for yourself. I instilled strength in my daughter who you were already so jealous of and treated poorly. Being jealous & verbally abusive to a Little girl.

[Part 2:]
In life you have to work hard to be successful, not try to tear someone down for thats the most coward way. Women are the essence of life. I cherish them. My strength is given to me from my mother. I am everything she taught me to be. I was raised in a single home by a single woman. I am a very proud black man.
I shouldnt have ignored the signs from your your first song and video I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW. But I thought you was beautiful. You came into my life at a time i was grieving from my moms passing. You was a friend. Because of that i wanted to marry you. And i did. And we had a big lavish wedding. Overall there was too many good times. I have to say i wasnt the most faithful husband. I was immature. Im sorry about that. But you bumped your own head sis.
Why do i have to live thru a constant divorce? It didnt work out. Life goes on. Im not coming back to you. Your married and im happy for you and Im a extremely happy black brother out here trying to make a difference for my kids and the next generation of young people who see me as huge inspiration in music, art,business, education and so on.
After 10 years of keeping my silence during a decade of dealing with very hostile behavior and verbal abuse and even your stepfather holding you back from one of your physical violent Attacks on me right outside your house THIS YEAR while trying to pick up our son while he watched from the window, it was my weekend and you denied me that because your parents were in town. I just went home. This has been my life for my sons entire life. Even our son wonders why you treat me the way you do?

[Part 3:]
Theres some seriously crazy things i wont i disclose for our sons sake.
Because you keep my son from me ive been going thru lawyers to stop you from this bullshit Im tired of it. Im tired of you painting a bad picture of me. Ive been tired of it but you never seem to get tired.
I even had to be in a relationship with you AGAIN after we separated just so i could see my son & I AM JUST TIRED.
Back then you asked me why didnt i stop the divorce from happening. I tried! We are too different. Some things arent meant to be. We were meant to be so that we could have our son. Nothing more. You didnt like that. I prayed for your peace of mind for years because of your uneasy soul. I still do. I guess some things take time. You definitely dont know me now and probably never knew me. You make up this image of me thats not true but its funny because its really you describing yourself. You made up stories about me and claimed i did things that YOU DID.
I hate all this, but you were a very jealous wife, and i had to deal with that and thats the worst feeling. How much heat i had to take from producers, writers, music attorneys and record execs etc who felt your mean spirited wrath and dropped you from labels, from startrack to them all. I stopped talking to jungle & steve stoute because of you & almost lost Anthony because of you.

[Part 4:]
You used to turn my phone off so my professionals couldnt reach me and take the battery. You insulted any and everyone whoever was around me. Not a single person in my life loved or could even stand you. Luckily for you our assistants all signed NDAs or you would have a list of men and women who would happily talk about how verbally abusive and evil you are. Your self saboteur ways has caused you your grief your dealing with. Not me. The altercations you speak of are no more different from what most normal couples go thru, but your exaggerated version is UNJUST. Whenever one is constantly attacked the instinct is to restrain that person or defend yourself to prevent escalation. In hindsight now my advice to young men out there in a situation like that is to RUN at the very first sign of verbal abuse or physical. I herd you said terrible things about me. It makes me feel sad how heartless you can be. You play with strong womens struggles like they mean nothing. Youre taking advantage of a moment in time where women who are fighting for their lives to get justice and be treated fairly & you just looked at it as an opportunity to get ahead. Like abuse is a game? Like tearing down your sons father is a game. You have a son! Why are you still competing with me by telling him bad things about me. Guess what sis, he has eyes and ears and smart as ever. i dont have to say anything. I think he knows whats really good. You will NOT stop me from fighting for my son. You tell him GOD doesnt love his dad because his dad doesnt goto church.

[Part 5:]
Didnt want to bring up money but since thats the fuel behind all of this Let me say that I gave you the tools to be successful after you was dropped from your label. I paid for your cooking school cordon blue.
The expensive yellow stove we had flown in from Europe. I helped pay for the remodeling of your house. Your assistant stole thousands from my cc according to Amex. Out of all people you should be completely understanding of my my grind. But you just cant win with you. My schedule is CRAZY but you never help me see my son. Im hardly allowed to talk to him on the phone. Ever.
My lawyer told me bring the cops to your house and show my court orders when you dont let me get him or answer your phone but who besides you wants to show their kids that his parents are that out of control? Ive been going thru lawyers to stop you from this bullshit for years. I finally got our custody together to work with both our schedule thru court, while leaving court you tell me your gonna get me back for fighting to see my son and 3 weeks later youre on camera doing an interview about your truth. Interesting timing. Do what you want just dont violate another court order sis because the judge wont like that at all. The judge already ordered you to pay my legal fees because he was tired of you wasting everyones time in court. No lawyer wants to represent you after what you put them thru. Thats why you texted me today asking me for more child support money-and you want to keep it out court. You will NOT stop me from fighting for my son. Remember GOD sees all. And Im no longer allowing you to take advantage of the fact that I did not want to respond in a manner that could affect my kids , friends or family publicly. THAT ENDS TODAY.

[Part 6:]
Everything with her is a plot and a scheme. Has no merit. No foundation
I didnt Wana speak up because i have real respect for our women. And definitely my son. I do not beat women. I did not beat up my ex wife. Stop. You got beat up in court. How much money do you want? Do you want me to relinquish my rights to see my son is that what you want? Just tell me. After all the tweets and posts you made thru the years disrespecting me and my family I still have love for you as the mother of my child BUT I am done with this. This game ends now and GOD will be the judger of all this. And although you tell everyone GOD hates me (some Christian you are) I will survive and thrive from this moment because I know who I am & you have not a clue who you are.

[Part 7:]
And to all the fans that knew my silence was due to the fact that I dont openly do this kind of petty shit... I appreciate you riding. And to those that were lead down a wrong path... I get it... very sensitive times and all things must be taken seriously. This is MY TRUTH. And I dont care what else she has left to say unless it concerns our son. This is the first and last time Im addressing this. Despite all of this I still hope for the best for her because whats best for her is whats best for Knight.
Love,
NASIR BIN OLU DARA JONES



[Intro]
The scientist is a man who was learned how to think
At least about scientific matters
That's why he can do so many amazing things
But a scientist isn't supposed to believe anything much
Unless its supported by evidence...

[Verse]
Lame foot soldiers get croaked in my vicinity
The ode for old murder, criminal activity
Diamond encrusted bracelets, escape death
Cars and yachts, I flaunt things that say success
Flow to the water turns my electric chair on
Inside the LeBaron trunk, got Pakistan her-on
Nasir Jones, not a Capo, the Picasso, word painter
Black Sinatra, rap King Cole, gangsta
Point blank body armor
I'm violence, you're the Dalai Lama
You just holla drama



Nas: "This ain't for everybody. Y'all know who y'all are
Yeah you, y'all know who y'all are. These are our
Heroes."

[Hook: Nas]
Let's hear it, one for the coons on UPN 9 and WB
Who 'Yes Massa' on TV, what ever happened to Wheezy? The Red Fox's?
Never got Emmy's but were real to me
Let's hear it, two for the spooks who do cartwheels
Cause they said they played they parts well
Now they claim caviar, hate that oxtail
Lambda Sigma Phi badge on lapel
Whitey always tell him, "Ooh, he speak so well"
Are you the one we look to, the decent Negro?
The acceptable Negro -- hell nah
But they say, "These are our heroes"

[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh, Massa used to breed us to be bigger to go play
Athletes of today in the NBA, make me proud
But there's somethin' they don't say
Keep gettin' accused for abusin' White pussay
From OJ to Kobe, uh let's call him Tobe
First he played his life cool just like Michael
Now he rock ice too just like I do
Yo, you can't do better than that?
The hotel clerk who adjusts the bathroom mat?
Now you lose sponsorships that you thought had your back
Yeah, you beat the rap jiggaboo, fake nigga you
You turn around then you shit on Shaq
Who woulda knew, Mr. Goodie-Two-Shoes
He love a little butt crack, got enough cash
Little kids with they bus pass who look up to you
To do something for the youth, stupid spoof
But you let them use you as an example
They would rep, but our heroes got they hands full

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nas]
You Homey The Clown, bowtie, apple pie, Bo Jangles
But we love Bo Jangles, we know what he came through
But what's your excuse, duke? You talk Black
But your album sound like you give your nuts for a plaque
You don't ride for the facts like um, say Scarface
You don't know what you feel, y'all too safe
Election done came and went, y'all worked so hard for it
Huh, and in the end we all got dicked
These are our heroes, thanks a lot public school systems still rot
Still harassed by cops, snitches on blocks
Sellin they peoples out - some real folks with clout
Tavis Smiley , Michael Eric Dyson
Stokely Carmichael, let's try to be like them
Nicky Giovanni poetical black female
Jim Brown to the people who sing well from
Fela to Miriam Makeba
The mirror says you are the next American leader
So don't be, acceptin new 'We are the World' records
These pickaninnies get with anything to sell records
Cause it's trendy to be the conscious MC
But next year, who knows what we'll see?
Ha-Ha, these are our heroes

[Hook]

Nas: "Yeah, I wanna give a special shoutout to the -- y'know
The crew doin' they thing out there reppin' us hard
Big up to Tiger Woods . Yeah, ya don't stop. Big up
To Cuba Gooding Jr . Y'know, yeah, y'know. Tay Diggs
What up my nigga. Yeah, ha-ha. And you don't quit
And ya don't quit, and ya don't stop and ya don't quit."

Male Heckler: "Yeah-Yeah, what you doin' for the hood though
Homie? What you doin' for the hood, man? Look at
All that paper. Drivin' around like a playboy in
My hood. What type of shit is that?"

*overlapping dialogue*

Nas: "I'm outta here. Please, excuse me, 'xcuse me -- please
Let me get to my limousine, I'm outta here. I know, I
Got a plane to catch. And I love you back. Ha-Ha
Yeah yeah -- And I'm outta here. A-ha-ha -- PEACE."

Thug Heckler: "Come on nigga, give back to the hood. Cocky
Motherfucker!"

[Verse 1]
United States in fear
London knows I'm a phantom, South Korea knows I'm here
Posted, planted without exception
Rise to your feet for this rarity
Nas and Dilla beat, the fly soliloquy
Some real nigga talkin'
This don't happen too often, take precaution
Liars and frauds got you exhausted
You've been accosted
Who told you I'd lost it?
I just put it down for a second, damn
Can the king lounge for a second, kick his hooves up?
Grow stubble on the face for once without a smooth cut?
Grow a little gut, can't even enjoy the fruit of my labor
Before they call me Luke and hand me my lightsaber
The ruler's back, you can tell by the trumpets
Prince of Wales sent me tea, biscuits, crumpets
Jewelry cost more than the car, car cost 200
Get out your chair, the season of Nasir

[Hook]
(Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da)
The season
(Da-da-da-da-da

This is the season

[Verse 2]
Jay Elec doesn't write it
HOV couldn't write it, he vacationin'
Jungle the only brother I take shit from
Hassan give me lines, we talk all the time
So I guess if he inspired my song it ain't mine
Let me make this clear, they fear the gifted
Some say Shakespeare never existed
Wow, now, look at the amount of resistance
Attempts to chisel my face, from the mountain you guessed it
Bitch you guessed it
There, did I answer your questions?
So, now that's out the way let's get back to my message
Now I'm 40 and a little change
Ride around, sport a new Benz, a little Range
Havin' fun, my little man gettin' big
He and my daughter down, when we talk it's real
Nothin' is watered down, young boy swag
I'm here today as well as the 90's
But the past, like my ass, is behind me
Ignite the pyrex
Try to bite this, get Nasty Nas-itis
Arthritis when you try to write this
Asking why is the Feds at my niggas?
Why the Feds at my niggas?
I know by now I should be talkin' bread, crack, and figures
But not stressin', knot stressin'
I'm survivin', I'm survivin'
It's funny when I catch cops textin' and drivin'
Who questions and penalizes them?
One day we'll have their ass in court and we'll be tryin' them
Hey yo, it's love for Detroit, Mo-Town, Motor City
Dilla lives on, it's like he wrote it with me
The soulful sample complements my rhyme so well
Slacks by Zegna, or YSL
Matchin' the Saint Laurents, I'm fly as hell
Hands in the air, the season of Nasir

[Hook]
(Da-da-da-da-da

[Outro]
Yeah, it's that time, yeah, Dilla rest in peace, what up Detroit?
Fly ladies, dope dealers and killers
Worldwide, NY
Yeah, yeah, the season
Yeah, this is the season...



[Nas]
Third grade, singin Star Spangled Banner
Using proper manners, learned to handle anger
Animal behavior
Later on my block rockin wit my jocks on
Eating Bon Ton cheese popcorn, hummin a KISS rock song
Socks long to my knees
Summer breeze runnin through the leaves
Playin freeze tag, can I stay out, please dad?
Can I hang wit my little gang out?
Hearin shots rang out, heard my moms call my name out
Come upstairs, run up stairs
Take a bath, shit stained underwears
Wipe yourself wit paper
Bad little ass in my bed at 8:30
Wash my plate, ate dinner up late
Gazing at the wall, prayin basketball
Was my future for this young one
Hooping in the sun, proud to be where I come from
Later shootin guns fantasizing
Fascinated by gold rope chains
Looking back at my hood days but things ain't change

[Hook] *all Nas samples* 2x
"Nasty-Nasty-Nasty Nas is a rebel to America"
"Lyrical professor, keep ya under pressure"
"It's like that, you know it's like that"
"Nas-Nas'll catch wreck", "You got the mad fat fluid"

[Nas]
Bumpy Johnson style, old timers, crocodile shoes
Pinky rings, bank robbers wit two's, boss of wild crews
Slacks overlapsed, apple jack hats, quarter field coats
Cadillacs wit white walls and chrome wheel spokes
They was organizing, investing in a piece of the hood
They had drugs, bettin numbers, police understood
They played the Cotton Club, red carpet, hoes on they arm
Plush minks, pimped out gangstas, civil rights wasn't won
E'ry Christmas they was Santa Claus
Nixon was the anti-christ
Bitches ass was bigger than sniffin nose candy white
Listenin to Malcom speak, talcum powder shaving cream
Layin back, barber chair, straight razor clean
Babies is born, big families started to blossom
Mad people just applied for apartments and got em
Used to be rules to this game of hustlers and dealers
From tommy guns to mac 10's
QB's new born killers (shit is changed)

Chorus 2x

[Nas]
Yo everytime I turn around, niggas shot, niggas stabbed
Winter nights, pregnant girls strugglin to get a cab
Fiends lurkin, D's searchin, pat pockets
Kids quick to bed but they heads from gats poppin
Queensbridge slingers hoppin out Benzes, don status
Dope fiends got syringes, poppin out they arms sractchin
I remember park jams
Gazelles, perfect wave shell
Adidas, smellin reefer way before purple haze
Private stock bare, niggas wit ill walks like Mark Clare
Hats tilted, wild niggas lickin shots in the air
Me and Pop was there, through the years our names would switch
Ain't nuttin changed but the names Nastradamus and Blizz
What project is this?
QB, Vernon and Tenth
12th Street, murderous pimps, hot as hell's heat
What could you tell me, nigga's seen it all in this game
When it's all said and done, just remember my name

Chorus 2x



[Produced by Havoc]

[Intro: Nas (Havoc)]
Uhh.. (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Q.B. since 1933 (no doubt)
To nine-six (nine-six motherfucker)
Check the shit

[Havoc]
Nine-six, Escobar 600

[Verse 1: Nas (Havoc)]
Check the shit
My mind's set, son got wet, I'm vexed really
They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly
Why niggas actin' illy? Word to Will, he 'bout to feel it
I feel it, he shoulda been dealt with it
Them niggas sour, they put to much flour in their coke
And got the nerve to wonder WHY THEY'RE BROKE
While we was gleamin', niggas was schemin'
Seen the ill Beamers beamin'
Triple-beam and doublin' cream had 'em fiendin'
To get they fingers on the dosa, I called Sosa
"Sosa, these niggas hit the God, bring the toaster
Meet me in the Bridge, I'm bout to go loca"
Left my rat beggin' me to stay and stroke her
He came through with two fly bitches, Venus and Vicious
With two MACs inside the Volvo, what up God, I'm still sober
I need some Henn to bend me over, my nigga Hav gotta soldier
It's gettin' down, it's goin' down kid (I got this, I got this)
I heard he might not live, I'm holdin' back tears
Told these broads to put it in gear
With two females that don't smile, diggin' they style, yo
What up son? These niggas done started somethin' wild
You know the clique well, Rhamel with the gold in his grill
Tried to get a name, holding the steel
I paid attention to the females
Maintained bitches when it get real
Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal
He said both hoes'll peel
Spray shots and reload and still handle the wheel
Point 'em out, smoke a Phil' then chill
I laid back, Escobar status
Knowin' The Firm got it cornered, we on it, shit we was born with

[Chorus: Havoc]
Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die
In this, business of trifeness
I finesse this, Boyardee, we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit'
Dangerous sons, step back let the TEC lift
Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up
Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die
In this, business of trifeness
We finesse this, Boyardee, we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit'
Dangerous sons, step back let the TEC lift
Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up

[Verse 2: Nas]
Hold it right there, pull over
That nigga right there inside the Rover
I knew he'd be right here, I told you
Let's get him now, look at him smile, ice Bulova
Polo pullover, big links and rockin' boulders
He's stuntin', after he left my man like that
Without a fair chance to fight back, but I'll be right back
He never seen us, Sos' gave the MAC to Venus
And Vicious, lookin' delicious, handle yo' business
And step to him, shake your ass, try to screw him
Do what ya gotta do to get to him
A tight Parasuco with young faces
Can turn niggas Buttafuoco, of all ages
They was amused by the way they walked, way they talked
Only if they knew these girls had sprayed New York
If they had to, heard him ask Venus, "Could I have you?"
He jumped out a Jeep, heard her tell him "Don't grab, boo"
They started chattin', was only bout a minute, flat when
They jumped in the back of the Jeep laughin'
We followed them pollyin', he thought the hoes were Somalian
Probably when they hit the Holiday Inn
I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and them
We laid low about a hour or so, these bitches movin' too slow
We both holdin', what if them wild hoes started foldin'?
Sosa said "Say no more", we started rollin'
Before we got in they must have shot him, security wildin'
There the girls go, hurry up we out
In the 940, me, Sosa and two shorties
The punk niggas got murdered in the orgy

[Chorus: Havoc]
Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die
In this, business of trifeness
I finesse this, Boyardee, we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit'
Dangerous sons, step back let the TEC lift
Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up

[Outro: Woman]
Q.B.C., Queensbridge motherfucker
Roping niggas up
Cause our clique is thick
Another day, another dollar
More money, more murder
Fuck this shit, Q.B. up in the house



[Nas]
Aiyo, this is big Nas
I wanna give a shout-out to my man Premo, you know?
From Gang Starr, no doubt
Lil' Dap, Jeru, Melachi, the whole crew (Foundation)
Queensbridge Crew, forty busters, shorty busters
Vernon Posse, Good Fellas, you know how that go
My man Ill Will rest in peace forever, God
Tragedy, MC Shan and the whole crew, you know how that go
Marley Marl, and my man Big Bo locked up in the piece
And my man Drawz, you know
(Big Mayo chillin', loungin' at the crib, check it out now)

[Bobbito]
The, the mic is open, yo
On the Stretch Armstrong showw, hosted by Bobbitooooooo

[Verse 1: Nas]
How should I start this?
How should I begin, to sin?
Grab the microphone and my rhymes'll win
Wheel of Fortune, spin, around
Check it out, I'm not a rap clown
Get smacked down by the fuckin' four pound in your dome
Hit you with the nick plate chrome
Queensbridge, that's my motherfuckin' home
Off the top of my head, yo, I'm a blunt head
Police... Police want a nigga dead
But I'm not goin' out like that, black
I kick the actual facts in solar
Cold as a Polar Bear, I swear, word to Will
But I'mma chill, rhymes'll kill
Niggas know the style when I freak the profile
Asiatic Child, yo
Grand Wizard on the side of me
Get on the mic and bless the M-I-C

[Grand Wizard]
Ayio, but I'mma pass it off to my man Six-Nine
Kick it one time

[Verse 2: Six-Nine]
Hey, yo, Six-Nine a true to life nigga
Yo, my style is iller, iller than Halle Berry's figure
Niggas don't fuck with the Six-Niner
Shorty, watch your mouth, I smack you back in your vagina
Here's the reefer, crack the Sunrise Tequila
Kill the Margarita, here's a 50, get some more cheeba
The ghetto trooper, so spark up the Bu-Buddha
My thoughts'll stay nasty like the underground sewers
To be the man, you gotta beat the man
It ain't nothin' startin' over here but nothin' mark my Timberlands
You want static? Let's have it
Niggas who flow like the Atlantic will sink like the Titanic
Since birth, I was thinkin' too fast
My first beef was with the doctor when he smacked me on my ass
The trigger man, I'm crazy like Sam
My skill's so ill like a white chick with a suntan

[Verse 3: Nas]
Check it out now
One for the money, two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alize, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God, check the prognosis: is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real
A nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis: my razor embraces many faces
Your telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic, automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so
My pen taps the paper then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
But, chill! Bless the microphone and say peace
So, Sudan, take the microphone in your hand
Kick the flim flam

[Sudan]
So, check it out
I'm gonna give a strong shout-out, this is to my man Will
A little somethin' I done wrote up for my man Will
It goes somethin' like this, it's called Rock-a-bye Homeboy
Check it out

[Verse 4: Sudan]
Queensbridge, when will the drama ever cease?
I'd like to say peace, Willie, and rest in peace
A cool brother who's all about justice
I still can't understand how he left us
Well... he's gone and life goes on, you know
We had a crew, but one by one we go
Memories of his face that was full of joy
Rock-a, Rock-a bye, Rock-a bye homeboy
Reminiscin' with the brothers standin' on the block
Never talked a lot, never was a big shot
It's so hard to say goodbye, a sad song
And damn, I can't believe my man's gone
Diggin' back in the days when we used to laugh
Now its a memory that's haunted from the past
Poor Willy, its a shame how the ghetto got him
And word is bond - I wanna cry when I think about him
Three bullets to his back on his own block
Not a way to go, killed by the buckshot
Queensbridge, wake and up and smell the air
And stop killin' like a villain, like you don't care
Remember Willie and the times we had with joy?
Rock-a, Rock-a bye, Rock-a bye Homeboy
Rock-a, Rock-a bye, Rock-a bye Homeboy
Quensbridge style!
Rock-a, Rock-a bye

[Verse 5: Jungle]
My skills are ill like the prez with a plan
My brothers run from Sudan then the Ku-Klux-Klan
Like a kamikaze, Saddam Hussein then won
Feel the buns of a nun, put tricks for funds and chill (Wooo-ooooh)
I spill a verse so you can understand
I kill rappers off quicker than a motherfuckin' Mic Man
And when it comes to a battle, I stand out tall
Like the man who played the man on The White Shadow

One two, one two

[Nas]
What you gonna do when the flavour's comin' after you?
Grand Wizard, take my side
Grab the microphone and I'mma rock it up like...

[Verse 6: Nas]
To my man Jungle, dwellin' in the jungle
Where must we go? Where must we wander?
Deep out the skies come the MC Nas
Not to surprise, but to civilize
All the dumb men wanderin' around the streets
Listenin' to a nigga rappin' on fly beats
I just kick the mad Phillie style
Get buckwild 'cause you know my style
I could run a word, kick it to a herd
Make 'em turn into a rich man, increase the plan
The master plan, yo, I'm buggin' out
'Cause the weed got me buggin', plus the Guinness Stout
Grand Wizard, yo, you my physical
Why don't you mic the make, make the microphone miserable?

[Verse 7: Grand Wizard]
It's the G, the G, the G, the G, the Wiz
You know that our culture's gone get theirs
I got my man Nasty on the side of me
My man Six-Nine, you know we're not hidin', G
I am the man that'll break it down
I'll break it all down 'cause I got the sound
I got Queensbridge backin' me
The Tec and everythin', I'm comin' strapped, G
It's like that, check it out, uh huh

[Verse 8: Nas]
Yo, check it out, y'all
Money and murder, money and murder
The sick shit you heard comin' from my motherfuckin', my swerve
The words are poetic
I sound energetic when I'm blunted or Mot'd
My microphone's upsetted 'cause I'm crazy
Now you know, never lazy
Yo, I'm gonna get all the cash I can
Don't give a fuck if I gotta shoot a policeman
Pluckin' a church and snatch a fuckin'...
Nah, can't be flippin' like that
'Cause you niggas try to jock the style
But I left that shit to get the new shit to flow like the Nile
Now you can't catch up, G
'Cause I got the new styles on the M-I-C
I keep gettin' newer, can't step to a
Nigga from the Bridge, so, you keep that shit
And I'mma flip the script next year
And my real name is Nasir
Can't spell it 'cause I say it too clear
The alphabets are not enough words or letters to use
When it comes to mics, I bruise
I just go with the magical mystic flow
Niggas don't know, that's word to the man Bo
I get Illmatic with the style that's insane
Comin' out a fuckin' murderer's brain
Grand Wizard, please take this mic from me
Before I bug the fuck out and wind up D-A-E-D
Wait, D-E-A-D, I'm buggin', fuck that shit

[Various shout-outs]



[nature]
Do you see what I see?
Do you smoke what I smoke?
Do you wanna smoke?
Do you wanna ride?

Yeah aiyyo aiyyo
When I walk into a room, niggas feel a slight breeze
Stay a little while till they feel they might freeze
Never understood why they never liked me
'cause when I locked the door, they turned into to icees
Starin at my feet all you see is nikes
Bet you never seen a ill pair like these
Size ten, never find me in a tight squeeze
At the airport, minutes before my flight leaves
Round trip tickets to who knows where
Stay boarding, never at least a day's warning
Previous plans, they spoiling
A dollar and a dream, the theme to new york, stay torrance
From st. john's to wake forest, wait for us
Straight ballers, you hearin it first
Nate flawless in almost every event
Puttin up point, while niggas like y'all stay scoreless

[Chorus]
All my niggas from the projects, light one up
To my bitches from the projects, light one up
And stay high, high
And pass me a cup of that good shit (so high)
We on some hood shit (so high)
Niggas from the projects, light one up
To my bitches from the projects, light one up
And stay high, high
And pass me a cup of that good shit (so high)
We on some hood shit (so high)

[nas]
What's me without the hood?
A tree without wood, a dutch wit no bud
A cut wit no blood
A fuck but don't nut, I be incomplete
If me and the street wasn't in between the sheets
I'm a product of hard luck, the money and murder game
Here's nature, kill a faker, man you heard of the name
From the cold streets of qb, old beef to new beef
No peace, through the song, what I see you see

[nature]
Mad bitches wanna smoke wit me
Niggas wanna roll wit me
Usually in my hood, find me in yo' city
Grimy-ette so pretty, it's like there's two me's
Wit no favorites, I try to love both of me
Thinkin of a way where I can better myself
Sometimes I get a head of myself
Holdin weed wit intention, frontin like I got it prescribed
So high I must be outta my mind

Chorus

[nature]
It's like hoppin in a glass pool, half full
Niggas only hit the bottom when they crash through
Mash fools out like they fast food
Bon' appetit, platinum or not, it ain't no match for me
I sum niggas whole careers up, scared tough niggas
Bluff niggas into thinkin that their year's up
It ain't a game, took six months off, the shit jumps off
Mini-me's are gettin punched in they jaw
My dunn call this shit animal rap
Me, I call it dumbin
My near-sighted niggas saw it comin
More stunnin, brand new flows to toy wit
Neck flooded on some hurricane floyd shit
Back and forth to st. crouix kid, same plan
Playin sega dreamcast till the plane lands
A changed man, niggas don't know, they never will
And if they don't understand, then they ain't fam, simple as that

Chorus 2x



[Verse 1]
Where we met, I had to give her her respect
She was with her man, he took a drag from her cigarette
He told her he'll be back
He jumped in the meter cab, just took her cell and told her where to meet him at
Now she was mad, And I was looking for my car
She had some plastic bags, coming from the supermarket
Cooking for his ass..how she gone get to the projects?
She aint got no cash, and she struggling while walking
So I drive past, "Yo" I say "I aint no stalker wit yo big ole ass
Heres my help Im tryna offer, I give you a lift"
Who woulda knew it turn to this? Now we in the mix
Baby moved up in my crib and she left my ex, damn we speedin

('Now girl, you mean the world to me' repeats)

Im a king, you the queen
His and her 6s and diamond rings
You dont have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then..
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when Im in, Im in

[Verse 2]
Baby girl had a son
He was 3, yea I took him in
Now she call him little me, I even look like him
Naw, I mean he look like me, a couple shades darker
She be calling him Blackie..thats cause his real father jet black
So she treat him like its a setback..
I dont respect that
Now his pops calling collect at the new crib on the new number
Now how he get that?
See, now I knew we was a mismatch
Im laid back, you too used to getting pimp smacked
I see where I went wrong at
I just tried to bring out the queen in you..
But when you make a girl leave a man..
You never really know where she stand..
How you know she really yours?
Somebody could do the same to you..!

[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
(It's yours)
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's minewhose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's minewhose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's minewhose world is this?

[Verse 1: Nas]
I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged, then
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
Behold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Six cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me

[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's minewhose world is this?

It's mine, it's mine, it's minewhose world is this?

[Verse 2: Nas]
To my man Ill Will
God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens
God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches
Aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days
We sell it, smoke pays, while all the old folks pray
To Jess, soakin' their sins in trays of holy water
Odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did
He'll lead a right direction
How you livin'? Large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?

[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's minewhose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's minewhose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's minewhose world is this?
Yo, the world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's minewhose world is this?
(It's yours)

[Bridge]
Break it down
It's yours, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours

[Verse 3: Nas]
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up
Even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin', Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames
Plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today

[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's minewhose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's minewhose world is this?
(It's yours)
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's minewhose world is this?
(It's yours)
Yeah, the world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's minewhose world is this?
(It's yours)

[Outro: Nas]
Yeah, a'ight?
To everybody in Queens, the foundation (It's yours!)
The world is yours
To everybody uptown, yo, the world is yours (It's yours!)
The world is yours
To everybody in Brooklyn
Y'all know the world is yours (It's yours!)
The world is yours
Everybody in Mount Vernon, the world is yours (It's yours!)
Long Island, the world is yours (It's yours!)
Staten Island, yeah, the world is yours (It's yours!)
South Bronx, the world is yours (It's yours!)
Aight



[Intro]
It's yours

[Verse 1]
I sip the Dom P, watching Gandhi til I'm charged
Then writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme - play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facing time like
Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracing
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
And the Nikes on my feet makes my cipher complete
Whether cruising in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it; the beats make me falling asleep
I keep falling, but never falling six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me

[Hook]
Whose world is this
The world is yours, the world is yours

Whose world is this
The world is yours, the world is yours
Whose world is this
The world is yours, the world is yours

[Verse 2]
To my man Ill Will, God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
My insight enlights vision words of wisdom
Niggas pay me in tuition to listen
The murder paragraphs of mysticism
Man plants seeds that bring forth multiple breeds
So many cultures on one planet but one culture's free
Son I need weed to proceed
Change the flow speed
I'm gettin' vexed Giuliani at 666
There's no days for broke days sellin' smoke pays
I tote the chocolate potent Phillies never wrote roach-sprayed
Shit is a hassle, The Bridge is like a haunted Castle
The mic's my religion the system is the devil's lasso
And yo, the trife life is most influential
The colors on mens skin and pens is coincidental
How you livin', large or broker
You wastin' time extortin' papers from smokers
Catchin' court papers gettin' broker

[Hook]
Whose world is this
The world is yours, the world is yours
Whose world is this
The world is yours, the world is yours
Whose world is this
The world is yours, the world is yours
Whose world is this
The world is yours, the world is yours

[Verse 3]
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps - I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded

[Spoken: Nas]
So I was talking about this music and uhh
To my man earlier, Green Lantern, I said
I wrote: "The word bestI'm thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter, my strength. My son, the star will be my resurrection."
I didn't know I would have kids at all when I wrote at 20
Some years ago, I had a daughter then I had a son just like
I setted that rhyme
You put down stuff on that paper, you'd be surprised
The atmosphere reads it, the universe reads it
And hears it, they can hear our thoughts, this universe
Be careful what you're thinking because it doesn't know how to differentiate what you mean with those thoughts
It willit will give it to you though
I was blessed, I was lucky with that

[Chorus]
(It's yours)
(it'sit'sit'sit's yours)

[Verse 1: Nas]
I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
Behold the mic I'm throbbin', my movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Ralph Lauren on my feet makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Six cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
President Barack Obama, he represents me

[Chorus: Nas]
The world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's minewhose?
The world is yours, the world is yours
Can you believe it?
It's your world, it's yours
It's mineit's
Can you believe it?
I said the world is yours
Believe it, yeah

[Bridge: Nas]
To my man Ill Will (God bless your life)
To my people right here (bless your life)

[Verse 2: Nas]
I trip, we box up crazy bitches
Aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso
There's no days for broke days
We sell it, smoke pays, while all the old folks pray
Soakin' their sins in trays of holy water
Odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did
He'll lead a right direction
How you livin'? Large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?
What you are soldier? I thought I told ya

[Chorus: Nas]
It's mine, it's mine (the world)
The world, the world, up top
It's your world
It's mine, it's minewhose world?
The world is yours, the world is yours, uh

[Interlude: Nas]
Break it down
Watch what you say
Watch what you listen to
I've been listening lately and a lot of these days ain't real
If I may say so myself
Alright, check it

[Verse 3: Nas]
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up
Remember that Mike Tyson back in the days?
Stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin', Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames
Plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today

[Chorus: Nas]
(It's yours) Oh, it's mine, it's minewhose world?
I said the world is yours, the world is yours
Whose world? It's yours
Whose world? I said the world is yours, the world is yours

[Outro: Nas]
To my Queens' crew, the foundation
The world is yours
To my people in B-more
The world is yours, the world is yours
To my people in VA
The world is yours, the world is yours
And the nation capital, you know the world is yours
The world is yours
Oh, da-da-da da-da-da
Smooth it out like that, da-da-da da-da-da

[Spoken: Nas]
Thank you



[Intro]
(Who's world is this?)
(Who's world is this?)
La la la, la la la
(Who's world is this?)

[Verse 1]
I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
A fiend of hip-hop, it's got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like 'Pappy' Mason with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab, or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Take money)
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me

[Chorus]
(Whose world is this?)
The world is yours
Disciple of the projects slash verbal murderer
(Whose world is this?)
Yeah, the world is yours
To the phillie bluntheads, crack-pumpin' drug murderers
(Whose world is this?)
The world is yours
To my niggas comin' home from lockdown with new plans
(Whose world is this?)
Fuck it, the world is mine
Holdin' a stolen cop's Glock with G-notes in my hand
(Whose world is this?)

[Verse 2]
To my man Ill Will, God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
My insight enlights vision
Words of wisdom, niggas pay me intuition to listen
To murder paragraphs of mysticism
Man plant seeds that brings forth multiple breeds
So many cultures on one planet but one culture's free
Son, I need weed to proceed
Change the flow speed and I'm gettin' vex Giuliani you 6-6-6
There's no days for broke days sellin' smoke pays
I toke the chocolate potent phillies never roach-sprayed
Shit is a hassle, the Bridge is like a haunted castle
The mic's my religion, the system is the Devil's lasso
And yo, the trife life is the most influential
Though colors on men's skins and pens is coincidental
How you livin', large or broker?
You're wastin' time extortin' papers from smokers
Catchin' court papers gettin' broker

[Chorus]
The world is mine
Persona of late Tony Montana yet gettin' mine
(Whose world is this?)
The whole world is mine
Who want it, I never front it, I'm forever blunted, hittin' lye
(Whose world is this?)
Henny up with the lye (La la la)
Never stop, we don't stop (La la la)
The Hennylo, puffin' lye y'all (La la la)
Don't stop the Hennylo (La la la)
Who puff the lye? (La la la)
Everyday, puff the lye plus the Hennylo (La la la)

[Verse 3]
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside a thousand miles from home
I need a new nigga, for this black cloud to follow
'Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' could make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' bitches like the Phantom
The crew is lampin' Ill Will style
Check the gold-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop
Checkin' dames plus the games people play
I check the games plus the games people play
Bust the problems of the world today

[Break]
(Who's world is this?)
(Who's world is this?)
(Who's world is this?)

[Outro]
Yeah yeah, yeah Wizard, keep that lye in the air
Yo, I wanna give a shout out to the whole fuckin' Queens
My man Tipster on the boards, keepin' it real Lord
The Queensbridge nation, get it on
Fakin' no fuckin' jacks, fuck around and get your wig pushed back
And big shoutout to my man Killa, Ron Du, it's on you
L.E.S. on another murder quest
'94, we out
Keep the lye in the air, Hennessy everywhere
Keep the la la goin'...

One, two
Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do
One, two
Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do
Check, one, two

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit
On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot
Rats drink from water drops, in the streets, niggas
Little kids scared cops, with red dots
Philosophical gangsta, with violent priors
Going back like black and white TVs with pliers
Leaning on broke down cars with flat tires
Flash iron on anybody trying on the blocks I'm supplying on
Madicon, my peeps, tie ballons up
And swallow 'em, and the P now got goons, lots of 'em
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of
Martyr, hood haunted like the Dakota
Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace
He begged for freedom, hanged with wild Jamicians
From Kingston, who drink Irish Moss
Listening to Peter Winston, Machintosh
Lightning hits the top of the church steeple
When I'm writing, semi-automatic, no hyphen
It's frightening

[Hook x4]
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move with

[Verse 2]
I take summers off 'cause I love winter beef
Started '87, with the shotty in the sheep
Three-quarter length, beige, dressed to kill
Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd
Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth
Woolrich, Carhart, gun powder stains
Smelling like trees, sensimille on the brain
Scheming on your girls, bamboos on your chain
Got ill up on the train
Twisting off a cap of a English in my vein
Might've pushed you on the tracks
Deaf crack fiends who can't speak, scream noises
Cause she bought a jum of soap from one of my boys
It's just another day in the hood
And I'm with some wild brothers, up to no good
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em
But our style was let them pile, then we robbin 'em
Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes
Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino going
And I had to make a song, speaking on my old life
For the thieves who come out at night

[Hook x4]

Yeah, this is history right here (history)
Yo, Nas, Rising Son
Queensbridge to London
Let's go..

[Verse One - Rising Son]
Yo, Yo
This is the Thief's Theme
For the underground criminal street teams
Street dream chasing young hungry thugs that seek cream
Crack fiends and hatch schemes, knife-point robbery
Broad day blindeys, night-time thuggery
Sun down shinanigins, move without shadow...
...like ninjas, cat burglars, no fiasco
No commotion, make moves like locomotion
Crack-sport ambush, get the man bringing the coke in
Warehouse crime rate, mans throw they vans up
Bang job, "Freeze, everybody put your hands up"
Cash is nightmare, gun in ya faceplate
"It's not even ya money, don't make me put one in ya face, mate"
Thieves running this place, world trade, eight fare
Slave rift flashbacks; Bush killer, hate Blair!
Wish Mars was a mile away, cos I would escape there
On a Skyway railroad, to stick you from my tray fair, bitch...

Yeah, you know like when you kill somebody in Street Fighter
Uah, uah, uah, uah (fades)

Little kids scared cops, wit red dots

Goin back like black and white TV's wit pliers
Leanin on broke down cars, wit flat tires
Flash iron, anybody tryin on, the blocks I'm supplyin on

And swallow 'em and the P now got goons, lots of 'em

[Intro: Erykah Badu]
This bitter land
Watered with my soul
The fruit it bears
Leaves me so cold
This bitter land
Does nothing for love
This bitter land
Brings pain from above, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yeah, running on the concrete across the train tracks
The devil is behind me
In the ghetto where's you'll find me, it's where I stays at
Cop shot us up, he get a medal then retire
But it never will define me
Write a letter to the president, whoever in control of the society
Tell 'em stop riding me, stop driving us into a suicidal ideology
Tryna feed my seeds
Getting high on weed, study my degrees
Stay fly, getting paper
With some dead white people faces in the circle of spaces around the green
I'ma lean, taking Percs Its a bitter Earth
Is a nigga cursed? Am I blessed? See what I mean
It's a test, life is a test
Life is like a hood, hard
Trying not to fall between the cracks
In the cracks it's so dark, and the dark
Seems more appealing than the light in the land
Where you gotta fight
Catch a body in the night, we need a plan
To survive, to survive the land
Survive the storm, when it comes through
Either you're busy living or busy dying, look what it's come to
Look what it's come to, so what you're gonna do?

[Verse 2: Erykah Badu]
This bitter land is far too real
This bitter land, it does not heal
Cause in the land skies are grey
But we fight the storms that come our way
A boy who strives to be a man
Must push to lead with all he can
Oh, this bitter land
Oh, bitter land
Oh, oh, oh, oooh
This bitter land, can't stop my fight
This bitter land

[Outro: Nas (Erykah Badu)]
Look what it's come to
So what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
(My land)



[Intro: Nas]
I want you to close your eyes
And vision the most beautiful place in the world
If you in the hood on the ghetto street corner
Come on this journey, the best journey
A mansion, acres of land and swimming pools and all that
Check it out

[Verse 1: Nas]
I'm capable of anything, my imagination can give me wings
To fly like doves over the streets, watchin' many things
Kids walkin' home from school on drug blocks
Missionaries pass out papers that read "Love God"
I see faces, cases, judges, and juries, Masons, lawyers and cops
I watch because every thug's face is my mirror
But this was one in particular
This kid, he was the vintage stick 'em up pro
Sixteen years old, did his jail sentence, nowhere to go
Every morning, calls his comrade to come and get him to smoke
He insane, already gone mad blames himself for his setbacks
Dangerous street corners where it sets at
Slang from dust to dawn, detectives act like they maniacs
Chasin' him, his asthma's flarin'
Smokin' like a chimney, on Remy, of course he not carin'
He need a place to go to keep his mind expandin'
I give him a helping hand, bring him out to Thugz Mansion

[Chorus: J. Phoenix]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love, and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drippin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in Thugz Mansion

[Chorus: J. Phoenix]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love, and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

[Verse 3: Nas]
A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason for nobody's momma to cry
See, I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'
I'm just twenty-some-odd years
I done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy
I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
'Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
'Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne
Where angels soar with golden wings in Thugz Mansion

[Chorus: J. Phoenix]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love, and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion



[Verse 1]
Yo, my man was regulatin' on niggas he used to thug with
Older niggas in this murder game, drug czars
BM, Jaguars, they cash was large
Since he was wild, they let him in
He did a crazy number of things
To put himself deeper under they wing
It didn't take long for duke to get on
Studied they movements - who would kill, who was strong
Studied like a student, got it bloody, he was shootin'
Drivin' they cars, robbin connects
Drivin' his Lex, keys was movin'
Young don, now they know they weakness
They never seen it comin'
Son was on some real take over the streets shit
Now he got his own crew of young guns clickin' now
Richer now, now they run shit, see how it flips around?

[Verse 2]
Dudes be, comin' from bids thinkin shit is different
'Cause the streets move fast, you blink, you could miss it
I just sit back and, think of my last 20 years
6 pack, gunnin' my years, jet black, blunt in my ear
Real relaxed, readin' real loves stories like
Caesar and Cleopatra, we need another actress to play her
'Cause Liz Taylor's hot, but the Egyptian queen
On the movie screen needs to be portrayed in a proper flava
Hopped in the shower, threw on the boxers with the baby oil
Baby powder, night owl, movin' to later hours, only
Fuckin' with kings, niggas official
If you phony, come in the circle, niggas'll diss you
We converse on the state of hip hop
We share the same views and feelings
He sling 'caine, crib costin' 2 million
He plan to leave the streets forever
But niggas that wanted him left him
Dead in the streets 'fore I can tell him



[Intro - Nas]
Uhh yeah yeah yo
It goes Tick Tock this is for my niggas in the Bridge, blocks
Comin' through better hide your wristwatch
Because niggas well live they shits pop
Hey hey
Tick Tock this is for my hoes make your hips rock
Light a L baby let the Crys' pop
Get your Tick Tock from this hip hop, anyday

[Verse 1 - Nas]
5'8" with double-X-L pen saggin' blunts draggin'
But never lived well, imagine, a felon on a two-way street
One way is where blood money coke and homicide leap
The other street opportunity the chance to live sweet
Think positive k-nowledgement k-cypher complete
So you can be an architect design appartments and shit
Or you can wind up on a jail bus dirty in clip
Soon as I'm on the set I'm never on a chick I play it cool
But still ain't pussy muscles get wet it's just the booze
Check my niggas, what's the gossip, what's the word
Puff some herb, all I see is niggas runnin', chin shots
All I heard, dip behind the car, see somebody on the ground
Ambulance came and got 'em they start calmin' down
Now it's back to the same old shit, you know, the Tarzan and Jane-o shit
In the jungle swingin' on vines, I saw the gat with the same old clip
Another nigga layin' the hit, bloodied up, scream that I'm dyin'
I be in Queens where the famous hood rats and ghetto stars are
Pimps do the shuffle at night with slutty bars pah

[Hook - Nas]
Tick Tock this is for my niggas in the Bridge, blocks
Comin' through better hide your wristwatch
Because niggas well live they shits popped
Hey hey
Tick Tock this is for my hoes make your hips rock
Light a L baby let the Crys' pop
Get your Tick Tock from this hip hop, anyday

[Verse 2 - Prodigy]
It's like this nigga
It's on, toilet up for me, roll that shit big
While I reveal the story of a wild street kid
Cock your seat back, relax, while I spit
The spittin' image of how I live
Well first I was hollyin' for years by them old timer clicks
I was like twelve, they was like, blood, listen
Keep your mouth closed and your eyes and your ears wide open
Gangsta, I soaked it all in, my first ammo was a one shot
Deuce deuce, had my pockets full of bullets I was real loose
Thug parties out in wave crash always got shot up
Thug parties out in Queensbridge always got shot up
No wonder we bugged out it gets so frantic
Niggas aim on the fight, we cut yo melon
Drinkin' that old english red bull and blue bull
Mean I draggin' with that cheap shit fuck it we was broke
Little badass, my nigga Rap sat me down, like this
He said: P you gon' wind up dead
You and Hav' real good with that music shit
You need to stick to it, dunn, get your mind of the street
And it stuck in the back of my head, though
I still did my little bit of menacin'
Every now and then bang-outs in broad daylight
Like these things really happen niggas get cut up
I put it in my rappin'
It's non fiction it's the real deal fiscale
It couldn't get more graphic I'm so trail
I said it's non fiction it's the real deal fiscale
City you havin' let me touch that ass

[Hook]



Chorus-
Said it ain't to much for me
To have you next to me

To not have you by my side

Nas-

You a girl with no fear people put ya hands in the air
For the GQ man of the year
That bentley that polstry leather, the leather
That be up in the coats i wear
Wherever i go so there ya have it
Cashmere fabrics never caught in last years garments
Holsters under armpits chauffers and the charms lit
And the coders holding on the dons wrist

Chorus-Amerie

How good it would be close to me



[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Swizzy!
Wherever you are (Shine)
Whoever you are (Shine)
Wherever you are (Shine)
Whoever you are (Shine)
Wherever you are (Shine)
Whoever you are (Shine)
Hey, Hey, I told ya

[Hook]
Ridin with my top down, and my jewelry on
Hey, Im just getting my hood on
Im just, Im just, doing my thing
Im just, Im just, (pimp) doing my thing
Hey (yup) hey (yup) hey (yup) hey
I said Im ridin with my top down, and my jewelry on
Hey, Im just getting my hood on

[Verse 1: Nas]
Its the late night greasy spoon patron
Poolhall making
Big bets, midsection got the 8 in
Dior Christian pimpin
Got that penal system diction
Riffing, you dont want it you snitchin
Spit a few at a traitor with that new AR
Try to kill me Im the leader, thats coup detat
Streetsweepers in that Coup all black
Bitches want my chipped tooth back
Steel mac, so my kufi never gets smacked
Squeeze the fifth with a grip as I dip
From the paparazzi
Still playing numbers (you cant stop me)
Still wearing bundles, and spark weed
If I ever say Queens get em, you know they got me
Success, scandal, bone deep, personal beef
So lead by example, or get trampled
Since Hip Hop Is Dead, this is the end
Congratulations in order cause we did it again

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nas]
The chains offensive
Brain on airplanes, Gucci frames are vintage
The two Tec Don in Yukons and Benzes
Chicks who suck other chicks tits like infants
The Apprentice but not Trump
Im the nigga with Glocks and pumps
That you dont see much
Sucker free from chumps
Homes with cobblestones in front of em
Hes got guns in cummerbunds, so understand you under son
Dont make me have you running from a hundred guns
Dont make me grab your only son
Im coming from
A place Tanqueray and weeds the only escape
From phonies who hate
When you rolling with papes
Thats why the God party with juicy models
They mob me, Denali, Charlie Luciano  hardly
Have to tell yall, I kill yall
For spitting songs that involve me nigga
Original verbal assassin, have to carve me a nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nas]
I got the armour tucked with the no drama luck
Tatted up, everywhere, my neck, arms and stuff
Like I roll my body around on wet comic books
The Dalai Lama prodded up, lighting chronic up
Ugh, of course Im at it again
When I do it you know N, I throw caution to the wind
I talk about the life Im in
But I swear to God I may never write again
But if I hit em hard, they say the World must kneel
Baddest girls gon lick my Tim boot heel
Sayin Nas running out of time
This is my last chance
Gotta shoots to kill, this is my last dance
I say hell nah, don dadda
Goons act fly, fly swat ya
Rapping ducks, modern day draculas
What you coming out your caskets for
This game been dead but guess who came back for more

[Hook]



[Intro: Nature]

[Verse 1: Nature]
Y'all know my pedigree, hoes blow the gods voluntarily
We're world wide, my heart pumps where the ghettos be
Young sharks be telling me, y'all niggas can't swim, y'all drowning
From my hood to your hood, the anthem, y'all wilding
I die for my coalition, the foes whispering
Hating, Wild Gremlins and those that roll with 'em
So I chose rap, we vamped to neva go back
Until this life of animosity, the high velocity
Niggas be on the same team planning to blow shots at me
Be the same mouths I try to feed
I write shit, entice it properly, 'til it hurts me
The same game as James Worthy, they spread my name like it's Herpes
Nature, niggas on the block boxing me, y'all not complete
We take this shit to where it gots to be, now smile philosophy

[Verse 2: Nas]
Sex and money go together like techs and nine shells
Swiss cheese you and cover it up like Roswell
Cartel, you ain't seen no iller regime
The Celest team, prophecy, project warrior, owns property
Crackers hate it, cops get jealous cause I stay with
The '98 temporary plates on my whip
The system thing is not right
A rich thug could fuck a cop's wife
Cause I'm on television and live the pop life
I rock mics, make mills, sound scan sales
One point whateva records, professional skills
Money's the root of evil but it'll make you happy
Don't wanna shoot my people but still they might clap me
Cause I talk like Dr. Malachi york, played the sidewalk
Hold fort, diamond plate chain, gold fork
Get in tune, rich life Ricky for silver spoon
Frank Lopez's crib, elevators and living room

[Verse 3: Noreaga]
Ayo we're still in Queens, same place where we use to be
Often you won't see us, cause we're usually out touring
Leave the hood now the hood boring
NORE, you know me, we're regulating
Straight from Iraq with QB affiliated
It's like a higher learning
From 99th street down to Vernon
Letting our heat burst burning
Like henny wet, throwing up my set
Catch me on star tec, 'bout to set the connect
Yo sex, drugs, money and murder, beers and sex
Lands and Lex in the projects
The 4th floor where we score through our cook-up
D's shook-up, hit the block and now you look up

[Verse 4: Nature]
Whispers turning to screams, from screams to hollers
Fans turn to fanatics, go home and dream about us
My zone, I need the chronic, my habit daily
Spitting, rapping fury, I got more steps then Alvin Ailey
Thousands will feel me, my nickname Braille
Dietec, the fakest niggas, cause their cliques ain't real
Each verse be pain filled, force to taking Motrin's
From the street to the screen, pictures be major motion
Nature grossing, holding my square where snake's approaching
React quickly, keeping gats where my dick be
A buck equal a hundred, so a half is fifty
Y'all do the math with me, before I hurt you
It's personal, you and I know, my whole squad be U-N-I-versal
From blood in to blood out, we thugged out
Fuck a four-four, I go to snub route, leave you rubbed out

[Verse 5: Nas]
Death followed him, before it swallowed him whole
It was signs he should of read that was inside his soul
Niggas light dutches to 'em now
So long miss a mutha fucka but still life goes on
Hope I'm rich on my last day, clutching some ass
Nigga said he came in with, got a nut when he passed
An old man laying dead on my bed, with some young shit
Screaming out "freedom" when I slumped her chest
After that, chill, be a bitch with a hex
Every nigga she sexed, be the next put to rest

[Verse 6: Noreaga]
Yo since a young sibling, had every flavor Timberland
Always had a jump shot and always dribbling
John McEnroe, Jose lay like Casserole
Doling Mike Tys', the jungle low, cut the china white
Come check ya, mixed the henny with the nectars
On straight flights while y'all cats connectors
If it was up to me, the whole world would be comfortably
But since its not, y'all niggas stay fucked up
I think about y'all too much and be bankrupted
So niggas get yours, I got mines niggas, so what, what?

[Outro]



[Intro]
It's like a cold story.. repeated over and over
In the winters of my mind, yeah
This shit be real, man..
Shit's crazy out here..
Yo yo, yo what up y'all?
That's my niggas over there, word

[Verse 1]
If you scared to take chances, you'll never have the answers
I could tell the future of a dude how his stance is
Wonder will he shoot then you should study where his hands is
Is he gon' cock it and pop it? His waistband big
But he don't have that thing in him, slangin just ain't in him
Body language is off, he's soft
But soft niggas all a sudden start dumpin', frontin'
'Cause he feel a way: my niggas say the eyes is a giveaway
One look could tell me if you really came to kill me
Be the quiet nigga lookin' lame with the milli
Who that over there creepin'? Who homie by the tree?
Better safe than sorry, look at p-noid me
Few machine guns close, we could squeeze all three
Be a cold day in hell 'fore they creep on me
Its a lesson every premonition
Lot of niggas killed 'cause they wasn't payin' attention, listen

[Chorus]
I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more

[Verse 2]
It's been so long, cant remember how we begun this war
This is a ever-lasting thunderstorm, 'cause guns went off
I see your moms, she still speak
She don't know I ain't cool with her son no more
Its old shit, see forever we holdin' this grudge
Takes real men to squash beef, end it with hugs
We buried our dead, been years, why should I worry 'bout him?
Constantly watchin' my back, plus niggas tellin' I dread
Another day I put a family in black
Though I be calm and relaxed
Though I know somehow it will come back
Even if I'm in the right, 'cause still a life is a life
What was it worth to see you covered in dirt?
Its quite redundant, whether you the hunter or the hunted
Mothers cry, no statute of limitation on a homicide
Just tattoos of my niggas' names
I wonder, will it change? Let's ride

[Chorus]
I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer thats fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more

[Verse 3]
It's rare I listen to niggas who never been in my position
A caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions
From the mind of a man who went at it with killers
Sit down, little man, let me school you in hood business
Seen a lot of niggas blow, lot of dreams folded
Some wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated
Ain't too much left to buy, bought it, I'm loaded, I guess
Lear jets, I ask myself: do I need love or success?
They say the artist that truly suffers, his stuff is the best
'Cause his heart bleed on his sleeve: pain, pistols and sex
Remember spray paintin' the word "fresh" and then starin' at it
Older folks angry, pointin', swearin' at it
Buildings I sprayed, nowadays drive the McLaren past it
Same old man from years ago told me life is short
So from infant to geriatric, trust your own judgment
Live with it and love it

[Chorus]
I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more

Dedication to my children, my child, Destiny Jones
To my niece and nephews, Suree, Malik, Jabari
The world is yours
Acknowledgements: first off I wanna thank God
And I wanna thank everybody for helping me out with this
Couldn't do it without you. Chapter 1

[Verse 1]
January 28, 1968
Born into this world, William Griffin The Great
Chapter 1, Wyandanch, Long Island
Scientific rhyming invented a new style when
He met with Eric Barrier from East Elmhurst
The melody they created was the first
Burst on the scene 1986, with clap to this
'87 dropped a classic disc
The facts is the tracklist was like full
The vocals, the beats, according to Marley Marl
Recorded in my hometown Queensbridge
That's why it's so relative
This biography was unauthorized
I spit it how it was given to author Nas
William changed his name at sixteen to Rakim Allah
Cause Clarence 13X had New York on lock
Gods on every block, jams in every park
I remember hearing Kurtis Blow saying
"It can't get better than this"
'Til Run DMC blew my brains to bits
From leather coats to shell toes to the Stan Smiths, to Dapper Dan kicks
First million-dollar deal ever in rap
18th Letter did that
From 4th & Broadway to Uni to MCA
We followed the leader to Harlem's Apollo Theatre
Supreme, Rap and the 50 that don't rap
Fort Greene, Queens, Long Island wolfpack
Paid In Full posse, hot they was on
And Ra had his firstborn
With the next line I'ma be easy
His wisdom's name is Fifi
EPMD put a record out, was dope
Tension spread, and I quote
"Smack me and I smack you back"
Sounded like the answer to the "I Ain't No Joke" track
For a second it ain't look good
Little tension buzzing from Wyandanch to Brentwood
Misunderstood, all forgot
At sixteen when I met Freddie Foxxx
Toting burners, the whole coast's most concern was
How has Rakim's flow made Christians convert with Islamic ways
Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em was the third LP
A sophisticated mean one
Before similar voices were King Sun
A few others, but sooner or later, the game was Ra's kingdom
At sixteen, son was watching him, mesmerized
Respect, not jocking him, was so amazing, besides
He came on the stage with lasers in his eyes
Walk with me now

[Outro]
Unauthorized Biography of Rakim
Epilogue: Mother was a jazz singer
Nephew to R & B legend Ruth Brown
Discography: Paid In Full, Follow The Leader, Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em, Don't Sweat The Technique
That's the end of the group, went on for solo
Dropped "The R", then The 18th Letter, then I think something, The Master
Was signed to Aftermath
Scheduled to release an album Oh My God with Dr. Dre
The album was dismantled because of creative differences
The end
To the new beginning, yeah
Next book, KRS-One. Peace



[Intro]
Yeah, real conversation for that ass
(It's what they want) huh
(It's what they want) what you say? Can't hear you man
(It's what they want, huh) speak the fuck up
(It's what they want) word
(It's what they want)

[Verse 1]
Nastradamus, skama lit, know when I rep
Flow when I'm set, I got the chips to make a Lotus my whip
Gold on my neck was once a code of respect
For high rollers and vets
Now it's loads of baguettes
Prefer a MAC-10 over a TEC
No matter sober or wet, I smack soldier cadets
Trees that might eject my hype back
Famous phrase "Nigga, light that"
Hoes you fuck ask you: 'Where your ice at, dunn?'
It's all about Playboys when we was young
Could only get tongue, then finally we can cum
Busting in hoes, guzzling 4's
Crack blitz, '86, you turn hustling pro
From bottles, to seven in your hand
To fake Pepsi's, to get to the crack, unscrew the can
Gleam blunted, seeing 100's, stacks of boy with a lean on it
We got it if the fiends want it
The whole block singing the same theme "Don it"
Fuck it, too many crabs in the bucket
If it's ice work, I'm gonna truck it
You gotta love it, you gotta love it

[Chorus]
(It's what they want) fuck it
(It's what they want) you gotta love it
(It's what they want) fuck it
(It's what they want) you gotta love it
(It's what they want) fuck it
(It's what they want) you gotta love it
(It's what they want, huh)
(It's what they want) (it's what they want)

[Verse 2]
Some girls get too emotional, fanatic extremist
Compulsive, with malice incentives, the foulest of bitches
Hunger my riches, her childish wishes
Be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes, them hoes
Conspicuous and it shows, tricking this dough
Kicking this flow, slip and you fold
So when your click roll, I let my clips go
Niggas on opposite poles
I got that confident soul, for those locked in a hole
Inhumane, living hostile opposed
To living on the street, proper from my top to my toes
Aeropostale my clothes, Vernon niggas in suburbans with liquor
Preposterous foes, finicky foul niggas
See niggas and blacks, there goes a loud difference
Coke sniffing, tapping 13 year old chickens
You can't be a kingpin when you snitching
Regardless, we still make you a target
We shoot you in jail, chrome objects
Hit you in your own projects, it's street-onomics
This rhyme is edited, credited through ebonics
Miserable cats, hunger paining
Get off your ass, stop complaining
My crew be in Montego Bay margariting, marinating
While you home, waiting your arraignment
This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment
Now back in the hood, certain cats, they wanna kill me
They ice grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me
You gotta love it, you gotta love it

[Chorus]
(It's what they want, huh) fuck it
(It's what they want, huh) you gotta love it
(It's what they want) fuck it
(It's what they want) you gotta love it
(It's what they want, huh) fuck it
(It's what they want, huh) you gotta love it
(It's what they want)
(It's what they want)
(It's what they want, huh)
(It's what they want, huh)
(It's what they want)



[Intro: AZ]
Yea, yea, check it out
I see today's mathematics as being understanding, you know?
Understanding is having the ability to see things clearly
For what they are not what they present theyself to be
It completes the cipher, you know what I'm saying?
It's also symbolic to the black child which is the best part
Ayo, son, represent

[Verse 1: Nas]
Now I'm the average nigga in the street life God
I try to beat trife odds, ride my L.E through the night fog and park
It's Buddha to be sparked, it's consistent
The beast smells the el because it travels long distance
Cruising in his Chrysler, pursuing niggas in my cipher
Start wildin' like insane asylum on Rikers Island
Verbal assassin, I murder freestylin'
One two for the gun crew, three drinking Cristal n
I play the side cause the words of man kill
Proverbs, buck out my grill, real as Ill Will, peep the steel
Nobody move nobody die, why must I be high?
Busting in trife bitches, touchin' mic switches
It's like a hot spoon of heroin, a Don like Perignon
Females love the guns I be wearing
Plant my seeds to live infinite, indeed in my sentences
I flow demandin', that's understandin'

[Verse 2: Nas]
850 Tempo but rugged like a Pinto
Chop shop hip-hop, burn the block intro
High priests release voodoo, dj vu and this taboo
Illmatic shit and what have you
Chef cocaine cook, no brain got the proper diction
My competition bleeds words and weed blurs my vision
I'm freezing in time, stop the rhyme
I'm sober in stolen Range Rover much crime
I, stick up America, Nas in your area
Disrupt the sound barrier, clowns get pounds of terror
A full whip for more clips then Clint has in his era
Dirty Harry, cold black the uncanny, of Kojak
A Beretta sticking up trucks carrying amaretto
Clever to entice 'em, herbs I'm micin' while I'm pricin'
Niggas like they're slaves, best behave I'm the nice one
Nas, broken down for Nasir, means protection
Pop Dukes, resurrection international hoes, I'm sexin'
Or you'll be fucking one section, question?
Does a lonely mic give me an erection?, yes, son
On a float like the Jetsons futuristic rappin' mystic
Bust it, try and diss while my finger is on the iron biscuit
I rhyme terrific sparklin' like the diamond district
It's understanding



[Produced by L.E.S]

[Verse 1]
Uh...
Pacino life, G a roll, casino dice
At the Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights
Gamblers, puffin' cigars, couples and stars
Flashin' cameras, dealers, shufflin' cards
Spent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd
'Cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob
I never hang out, when we do we bust the .45
'Cause shells comin' back at us while we jump in the ride
Flyin', duckin', our bitches in the club cluckin'
Tellin' my wife who I was dancin' with like I was fuckin'
Flew back, Monday evening from Nevada where the sun was beamin'
To the concrete jungle of cement
Limousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin'
Told my dogs peace, kept it movin', I was beat when
Got to my crib, where the hell my keys went?
Ringin' the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure
Dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door
Slow music, H-Town, no that's down low
My baby's, drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around yo
To the back, she must be inside and can't hear
Probably upstairs, in the mirror, doin' her hair
I walked in through the back door entrance
Shocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense
Chased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses
And lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas
A pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands
Somethin' swingin' on the ceiling fan, I stopped it
Swingin' slower and slower
On the last swing I saw it was a G-string and heard laughter
Thought about my nine-side Glock but somethin' made me disregard it
Started my way up to where the noise and music was at
Froze, I couldn't react
Bedroom door opened a crack, seen wifey layin' with some nigga
Mumblin' shit, he had one hand on her ass
And she was rubbin' his dick, toastin' wine glasses
Cherry scented candles was lit, couldn't handle the shit
Searchin' for words I found none, without a sound
I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun
Now I'm out buggin', whylin', what I'm gon' do?
Call my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin' through

[Chorus]
I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?
I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Got up with Horse, showed a look on my face was mad lost
I ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off
"Son you home early -- they wiped you out that quick?"
I said, "Nah," showed him the plastic with nine in the clip
Hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play
To the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway
I said, "Bet you'll never guess in a million years
What I just saw happenin' -- and probably still is
Snuck in my crib - some nigga fuckin' my wiz
I saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid
I'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me"
Just when I thought I found love, she shitted on me
Shopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement
20 G's on a ring I would have hit her today with
My surprise couldn't match the one she had for me
We pulled up, he was walkin' out the house backwardly
Parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us
Ran to the side of my house, cocked the heater
Walked to the front when I talked he had jumped
Bitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot
Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in
Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend
One between the eye, she's died, by mistake
Must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face
Heard somebody knock -- Horse helped me hide the bodies
Heard si-rens, I guess we goin' out like kamikaze
We surrounded, red lights flashin', who's inside?
Came out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin' suicide
Horse asked me for the MAC, he gave me dap, one love
Cocked the strap, then he ran out the back
Mad shots couldn't tell what was goin' on
Sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms
Pulled her ring out my pocket I was savin'
Put it on her ring finger cocked the Glock, and started prayin'
To Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial
Through you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin'
I never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed
This'd be my fate, such a grotesque, murder scene
On that note, same time, the cops busted in
Kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said "Amen"
Put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer, held her close
Squeeze the toast, said to her, "Now unto God, we elope"
.. we elope

[Outro: Cop]
Stupid fucking niggers



[Sample]
"They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan
They were trying to touch on and thieve envy within the leadership
But as a general and a man that rose through the ranks through discipline
His presence inspired those men with the discipline he imposed on his own life
Louis Farrakhan"

[Verse 1]
Uhh, yeah, wow..
No revolutionary gets old or so I'm told
You're left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free
Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me
I heard gun shots rang; his bullet's got my name
I ain't see 'em take aim, I dreamt this day came
'Cause I stood in the face of damnation
Satan spat at 'em, flat out disgraced 'em
He want my blood, why me?
Why not the fake ones who deserve death, man?
Fuck it, I'll take one, 'cause stop me
But can't stop a whole nation of millions who feel you deceived them
They believe in reparation makes it even
So I'm deadly now because of one reason, they listening
In Budapest, Japan, China, and Switzerland
We getting it in son
Another bullet pass by, missed me
Wondering who plotting to get me?
Alphabet boys still plotting against me
To hush me and stuff me in the pockets of history
You won't remember why they came to clip me
When time go by you'll soon forget me
They say he was the king of bling, jewels, and Bentleys
Then they use one of my lines just to prove I'm guilty
Don't let 'em kill me...

[Sample]
"They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan."
"They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan."
"They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan."
"They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan."

[Verse 2]
Some revolutionaries do live long
Am I one of them? Guess we'll know in due time
Everybody has rights, can I use mine?
Can I rock shine? Can I have a girl that's too fine?
Got a swell life, tell me will I lose mine?
Every time I turn around somebody new dying
Let's start living,  la carte, Escargot
Escobar, invest my millions
Mansion for the wife, the rest for the children
Knowing that they coming anytime
But until then, i'm at large till they shoot me
Million dollar stones in my camouflaged Gucci
Giving you this crack like Pookie
To question the system, be the resistance
No matter what color you are, everybody niggers
Or you can stand by or watch or you can march on with us

[Chorus]
Some revolutionaries get old although I'm told
You'll get a left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free
Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me

Some revolutionaries get old although I'm told
You'll get a left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free
Oh, it's just a matter of days before they try to take me...



Uhh, oooooh baby, baby
Keep it thug, and keep yo' heat, na nah nah nah nah

[Verse 1]
Now slowly, thinking of all the things that oppose me
I think of kings who died and rappers out to dethrone me
For they crown they head is cut off, bodies is laid
Dead in the street, it's so fucking pitiful
First they love you, could be the bitch that even live with you (ho)
Mad at your riches, now she switched, turned miserable
Cause she wanna dress like Bonnie, Robin and Crystal do
But Crystal's single, Bonnie's broke and her niggas too (ha)
I can do bad by myself; went from rags to wealth
From Jags to Bentleys to, plenty ass bitches
Can't keep they hands to theyself no more
I'm like, Hugh Hefner, you lesser, you just a

[Hook]
Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch
You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down
So you - wanna be me, you bitch, you phony
You clone me, you wanna be me son, I'm the one and only
But you - wanna be me, you suckers, you weak
You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day
But you - wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson
Concerning this mic profession, turn your direction

[Verse 2]
You can't be me, not in your wildest fantasy
It's childish; should I have to resort to violence?
Pay me a half a million, I'll consult your album
And show you how to stay off my dick
That's the thing I hate the most, can't even call you a man
When you gotta call out my name to get you some fans
No talent, you need direction; you a pussy with a yeast infection
You unlucky, I'm your fucking C-section
Plus I'm the last real nigga alive
Toast glass, Ill Will, the label get high
Realize, how many classics I gave you
Perhaps if you think back you'll realize that I made you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You can't be me, I'm trying to walk a straight line
Why they trying to take mine? I'm past 8 Miles of every state line
Eating, alligators and, hummingbird hearts
At the Player's Ball, Brioni suits, y'all birds watch
As real millionaire, shit'll take place
Evil as Hitler's hate-race people
This is God son, and I've come from the God under pure peace
To represent the streets, you'll see that my plan
Is not to destroy your man
But to bring more to mankind and teach
Every MC reach for your pens and papers
Lesson one be creative; what you made of junior?
Cause soon you'll be a grown man with the mic in your hand
And understand, to battle Nas not in your plan
I'm the last real nigga alive, understand that
And you my offspring, the boss sting
A bulletproof Porsche things, hard for you to understand that
Nas the king, where my bricks, where my band at?
Play me a gangster's theme, while you entertain me
If I ain't crying laughing, to the lions, throw your ass in
What the fuck was you niggas thinking?
Guns'll clutch if I get a inkling that you coming for the kingpin
But I laugh at you cowards, ha ha ha
Take me out, try try try, but you

[Hook]

You can't be me



Uhh, ooh baby, baby
Keep it thug and keep yo' heat, na nah nah nah nah

Now slowly, thinkin of all the things that oppose me
I think of kings who died and rappers out to dethrone me
For they crown they head is cut off, bodies is laid
Dead in the street, it's so fuckin pitiful

First they love you, could be the bitch that even live with you (hoe)
Mad at your riches, now she switched, turned miserable
Cause she wanna dress like Bonnie, Robin and Crystal do
But Crystal's single, Bonnie's broke and her niggas too (ha)

I can do bad by myself; went from rags to wealth
From Jags to Bentleys to plenty ass bitches
Can't keep they hands to theyself no more
I'm like, Hugh Hefner, you lesser, you just a

Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch
You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down
So you wanna be me, you bitch, you phony
You clone me, you wanna be son, I'm the one and only

But you wanna be me, you suckers, you weak
You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day
But you wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson
Concernin' this mic profession, turn your direction

You can't be me, not in your wildest fantasy
It's childish; should I have to resort to violence?
Pay me a half a million, I'll consult your album
And show you how to stay off my dick

That's the thing I hate the most, can't even call you a man
When you gotta call out my name to get you some fans
No talent, you need direction; you a pussy with a yeast infection
You unlucky, I'm your fuckin' c-section

Plus I'm the last real nigga alive
Toast glass, ill will, the label get high
Realize, how many classics I gave you
Perhaps if you think back you'll realize that I made you

Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch
You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down
So you wanna be me, you bitch, you phony
You clone me, you wanna be son, I'm the one and only

But you wanna be me, you suckers, you weak
You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day
But you wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson
Concernin' this mic profession, turn your direction

You can't be me, I'm tryin to walk a straight line

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Literally rich since nine-six
Still woulda hit a enemy with a TEC in nine-six
Exotic material on the neck and fly whips
I was fresh out the 'jects, decked out to death
Y'all witnessed it, I could fill you with real millionaire shit
Escargot, my car fresh from the dealership
Esco alias, my escrow grow daily
It's the freshest Air Max wearer, yes
Ejaculatory depression after sex
And that mean after I nut, don't touch me, no questions
Unless she's a restless spirit then I can heal it
Spend a lot of time together, I know her feelings
But you fightin' what the essence of a woman is
I respect you, my love's limitless
But what are you becoming?
You wanna be the man or the woman? Play your position
Mornin' or night I'm lickin' the pudding ain't I?
Since my days of St. Ides
Pullin' out box cutters to bang opps who ain't us
To Bentley Continentals, see the man I is
Hand-to-hand hustlers always claiming they ran The Brizz
The big homies don't approve that
Felt and Dirty Red fundin' RK but where was you at?
We all tried to move crack
Nowadays I'm just showing my age
The new goons hardly heard of these legendary names, it's strange
The Bridge rappers influenced me, son
But if I was in the Juice Crew, we woulda won
No disrespect 'less disrespect served to me
You a gangsta groupie, gassin' niggas to murder me, nigga?
Who I'm reppin'? 10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family
And that's word to Yammy, yeah
Deep roots, I ain't have to fake it yet
Old solid tree branches ain't breakin' yet
A vet

[Chorus]
Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family
Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family

[Verse 2]
I got the je ne sais quoi, why bother
With girls who like to play keep-away with they toddlers?
She started with good intentions like a rich pastor
Bitch was bad, turned from good thing to disaster
Takes forever to build a rep, one second to lose it
She put her neck in a noose, snapped it
Hangin' on every word she heard come outta cougar mouth, super foul
Play your cards right, deuces wild, salute my pals
Fathers all around the board goin' through it
She got lobster appetites, lots of habits
Like frontin' when she need apartment deposits
Here's something, get you a starter
But pardon my pimpin', I don't sponsor
I don't buy cars, I coach you to win, know what?
If you broke and your man don't teach you, get rid of him
Who I'm reppin'? 10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon, still
And that's word to Will, for real

[Chorus]
Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family
Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family

[Outro]
Shout to Draws, Spanky, Black Ed, Hands
Shout to Shabazz, Wewop and Harvey
Rest in glory
TJ Killa Black, rest in glory
Shout to all the young legends we losin' too soon
Yeah

Promise me that she gon' play her part (ugh)

Long as the butt bubblin' back in your waistline
I don't waste time (ugh), I gotta get-get on it
Just you and me, two glasses, silver Patronin' (ugh)
In the club scene where I met Ms. Green Eyes (uh-huh)
She walked by askin' me, "Are you Nas?"
(Why?) "If you was I'd be totally twi"
(What's that?) "Totally with it, T-W-I"
Haha, well, here I am, yep, I'm the man

Little cute thing, said, "What's yo' name?"
I put my necklace in her face and told her read the chain (woo!)
Ooh-ooh, so stuck up, told me shut the fuck up
BLAOW! Ludacris in the how-oooh-ouse!
The needle hit the record, they was playin' this song
All the ladies hit the floor and it was uh-uh-on (ugh!)
Live forever like 'Fame,' let the Leroys dance
While I'm laid back, chillin' in my b-boy stance (c'mon!)
Could be a little pop lockin' if your girl's top droppin' (yeah)
But watch for cockblockin' on my coochie stock options (woo!)
But later for the ASSDAQ, throw 'em on the fast track
Make 'em swip-swap; Nasty N-A-S, pass that
Honey in the black cause I'm feelin' her curves
He looked down at what I had and said, "W-w-word" (ugh!)
Why only serve one when we can serve up two?
Then at the bachelor pad, doin' what the Virgos do
And these women so shy but get loud undercover
So we can have sex but I can't be your loverrrrrr
Buck! buck! buck! buck! buck! buck!
Ah, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha ah ah-ah, SING! (UGH!)

Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo? (ugh!)

Eating, alligators and, hummingbird hearts
At the player's ball, Brianni suits, y'all birds watch
As real millionaire, shit'll take place
Evil as Hitler's hate-race people
This is God son, and I've come from the God under pure peace
To represent the streets, you'll see that my plan
Is not to destroy your man
But to bring more to mankind and teach
Every MC reach for your pens and papers
Lesson one be creative; what you made of junior?
Cause soon you'll be a grown man with the mic in your hand
And understand, to battle Nas not in your plan
I'm the last real nigga alive, understand that
And you my offspring, the boss sting
A bulletproof Porsche things, hard for you to understand that
Nas the king, where my bricks, where my band at?
Play me a gangster's theme, while you entertain me
If I ain't cryin laughin, to the lions, throw your ass in
What the fuck was you niggas thinkin?
Guns'll clutch if I get a inklin that you comin for the kingpin
But I laugh at you cowards, ha ha ha
Take me out, try try try, but you

[Chorus]
You can't be me



Verse One:
Yo, the Lord is my shepard
The sword is my weapon
Reward is a blessin', that comes from the struggle
Shoes been scuffled, blood's been shed, another Mother loses a son
'cause where I'm from the young chooses a gun
Before they choose an education
But once dead their ain't no awakenin'
So like once said, life ain't for fakin
Yo, you wit' me when I say duct tape 'em?
Fuck waitin'
Got the truck outside, Benz jeep for navigation
Everything in position, they'd rather be fuckin' wit' Satan
When I aim I ain't missin', master of assasination'
I heard he call himself Esco, drive a Lexo
Rocks his hat sideways, showin' off his waves with a chipped tooth
Is this the truth?
This is what we do, sip a brew
Wait around his crib until it turns around two AM
As soon as he walks in the door we slay 'em
You guys got fat while I was away, so start payin'

Chorus - Okay, you wanna play rough?!
(gun shots) (scratching - a thug changes, and love changes) repeat 3X
Okay yo, we could play rough!

Verse Two:
Okay now, drive up to my crib, am I high enough?
Who these niggas tryin' to hide in their truck
I ain't order cable, why in the fuck these niggas
Ducked in they seat? are they lookin' for me?
But I ain't do shit, could it be that niggas thought
I slept like B.I.G. and Pac did
May they rest in peace, but while I'm alive I pop shit
P-11 Glock spits 17 shot clips
Put these niggas in boxes, where they Moms and Pops is
Pull the strap from under the seat
Back up in the street
Watch these niggas thats tryin' to watch me, I carefully creep
Take off my shoes, barefoot nigga poppin' my heat
Empty every shell in their direction
Its you, I should've guessed it!
Same niggas that I was connected wit', I know sent you
Now I'm'a take you off here, you dont know what you got into

Chorus

Verse Three:
Walked in his house, smackin' him up, "what you talkin' about?" he said
Shut-up nigga! knocked him in his head with chrome
Never thought I'd be in his home
With his wife taped up for my niggas to bone
Fuckin' with me, you should've known
I'll have 'em write "stupid nigga" on your tombstone
What money can do, get you hit for less than a G
For threatenin' me
I'm'a do it myself, take you to Hell, this ones for free
Killin' you niggas with nothin'
Left him dead, engine runnin'
You the only I'm makin' sure that gets whats comin'
Look at your Woman, anal ripped out, its your fault
They gang banged your bitch out in your face and you saw it
But before I let you have it I'm searchin' your crib
For pictures of relatives, addresses to where they live
Shit like that, incase a nigga wanna strike back
I'll be right up in his ass to blow 'em out with the Mac
Niggas treat you like Fam, and you on it like that?
Now you gotta lay flat, gettin' eatin' by rats
Gettin' even's never wrong, its only right to react
Eye for an eye, 'cause the sweetest part is payback
Somebody kncokin', who dat?
"a cop man", let him in
And give that mothafucka one under the chin
Can't believe this nigga down with the Feds!
The copped screamed out your government before he dropped dead
Dont explain, I put the pound on his head
Blew 'em! before that I can't remember the last time I said......
Okay, so we gonna play rough!

Chorus

[Chorus 1: Keon Bryce]
There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feeling alright
I got a blunt for my chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now that I'm feeling right if it goes down
'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown
And I know it's not my time to go now
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown
So I know we'll be alright

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yeah, Brooks Brothers overcoat, know the ropes, smooth as Hall & Oates
Briefcase, silk ties, slick as them older folks
Silver fo'-fo', cocked? No
My chauffeur driver just left some of my colleagues smoking that Cali
Caught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window
Kinda' see my father's features creeping in a little
Got an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica
Tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll take her
And I'm late to a date with my wife, I realize
I stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise
And I'm walking through it, chaos is all around me
But God got me, no fear, through the fire, try and stop me

[Chorus 2: Keon Bryce]
There's a war in the streets tonight
And all this drama's got me feeling uptight
I don't know what I'll do if I don't see my boo
Cause she's standing on the corner of Linden Boulevard
Holding our baby in her baby in her arms
So hold on, your daddy's in sight

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yeah, nine-four, Destiny opens her eyes
For the first time, praise God, baby mom's crying
Planned to be a strong black family
But we both were too young, too strung, too much flashing
Newcomer called Verbal Assassin running with
Nothing but the worst type, worst fight
When we brought my baby home the first night
Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib raging
In my new car bought from entertainment
Champagne and gaining clout fast, whiplash
Did this bitch just pass in the club hugged up, stupid ass
Grabbed her by the pony tail, "never disrespect me"
I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi
Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the Land's mine
She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again
Squeezing the pen, released again, chart toppers
Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems
New woman, she's great, this a different world
Checking out my wife's chemistry with my little girl
It's so amazing, playing, life is so crazy
I've grown up the thankful for lessons God gave me

[Chorus 1: Keon Bryce]
There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feeling alright
I got a blunt for my chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now that I'm feeling right if it goes down
'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown
And I know it's not my time to go now
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown
So I know we'll be alright

[Music changes]

[Outro: Unknown speaker]
From the day you was born...
Your daughter Destiny, was one of your destinations...



[Intro]
Wassup, African?
Wassup, African?

[Chorus]
Yo the Haiti, Barbados, Bahamas, Grenada
The war is against love, we under attack
Paris, Pyar, St. Thomas, DR
The war is against love, who's busting back?
From New York to Botswana, London to Guyana
To every single African that's on the map
Yo, to Mexico, to Cuba, Iceland to Bermuda
The war is against love, we under attack

[Verse 1]
Scientists told us how the Mayans lived
Highways are landing strips for planes to land
Before the Wright brothers planned aerodynamics
Now I am chilling 20 karats like a savage
Not embarrassed
Buy what I'm copping while I'm shopping out in Paris
Parasites try to steal the culture (True)
While chem trails and satellites hover over
Feds is watching, real niggas ask this is so (Ask this is so)
Still the 5th is loaded (5th is loaded)
For these lawyers who be ripping soldiers off in court
They don't get em all, they just take your money and lie
Have you sitting up north (Foul)
Study the law (Word)
Get your appeal (True)
Soon you back on the street the shit'd get real (Facts)
They try to kill us off since the days of the brilliant Moors
May they ships pull up to the Sicilian shores
So I hustle more, ain't no justice for the poor
Got me feeling like middle fingers up, fuck the law
Bust a Dutchie open, liquor pour

[Chorus]
Chicago yo, you know Chicago y'all know
The war is against love, we under attack (Yeah)
New Orleans, New Orleans to Queens
Yo the war is against love, who's busting back? (Me)
To Detroit (Yeah), St. Louis (Yeah, yeah)
To every hood in all the 50 states on the map (Map)
Chocolate city, North and South Philly (Philly)
Feel me, the war is against love, we under attack

[Verse 2]
I went from, semi-bummy nigga to money nigga (Ha)
Bike nigga to car nigga
Christ nigga to Allah nigga (Alamdulillh)
Then I evolved, nigga (Yeah)
No religions, my commandments are my standards (Word)
A stand up man, no clowning, no snitching
Got a bid, I'm sitting down
Do the time, call it paying taxes
Living with my actions (Word), corners to the grave
Yeah, I'm on that wave
Yeah, I fornicate with fly bitches, horny ways
Just the way I was taught, though (Uh)
Can't tell if this is reality or just another award show?
These women be lost, so beautiful, so smart (Word)
But why can't we be heavenly? Don't think, use your heart (Yo' heart)
'Cause we could be so great, pray it's not too late
Put pride aside, coincide, I bet we both be straight
Straight to the top, side to side, twin Rolls Royces
We made choices to be devoted (Uh)
To go at those foes who come at us with upside down crosses

[Chorus]
The war is against love, I ain't trusting that (Trusting that, uh, uh)
The war is against love, who's busting back? (Me, me, me, uh)
To all the 50 states, all across the map (The whole world, too)
USA and beyond (And beyond)
The war is against love, how will you react to that?

[Outro]
Yeah, tell you how I'm reacting
I'm strapped and ready, go all the way
The war is against peace
The war is against love
Yeah, know that



[Intro: Raye]
Oh yeah-yeah
Oh-na-na-na, uhm

[Raye]
Concrete bricks, bullet proof vests
I'm proud of these walls that I built to defend
And protect this bold heart
This bold heart
But the way you marched into my home
Not few, big army
With the weapon on your arm
Yes, you struck straight with your cold heart
Your cold heart

[Verse 1: Nas]
I'm like Nat, I'm like Nat
I'm a man of God but where is Christ at?
And even though my name is Nas I am like Nat
Is this me declaring war? White flags
I now know why I was even born
To strike back
A full moon up in the sky, that's a sign that
It's time to get my liberation, the perfect configuration
It's the birth of a nation, midwife black
Mother father, caucasian
My blood Indian, native
So now I'm contemplating being like Nat
'Bout to show you what I'm made of
I'm what racists are afraid of
No mule and the 40 acres
And despite that
Watch out for the traitors
When they say make America great again, do they mean make us all slaves again?
Don't be sidetracked

[Hook: Raye]
Is this you declaring war?
No, we will never wave the white flag, the white flag
So you think I'm gonna run now?
No, the time has come to fight back, to fight back
This is me declaring war
This is me declaring war, war
This is me declaring war, war

[Verse 2: Nas]
Don't want to be a victim no more
Depicted as a criminal, especially when you're poor
Why doesn't the government order capital punishment
To officers
Who racial profile and put slugs in us
Makes me think they want us extinct
On the brink of insanity
We screaming for justice, they sending tanks, the man in me
Demand we protect the family, anarchy
Ku-Klux-Klan and him demanding he damage me
So my fantasy is every single one of us
Come against the evil divide of people, it's common sense
The fury, I hope the whole world hear me
No justice, so I became a revolutionary
No matter if you're red, white, black
If you want freedom then we're all like Nat

[Hook: Raye]
Is this you declaring war?
No, we will never wave the white flag, the white flag
So you think I'm gonna run now?
No, the time has come to fight back, to fight back
This is me declaring war
This is me declaring war, war
This is me declaring war, war

[Outro]
Dear America, it's time for a better America
There's a little Nat Turner in every one of us
No matter if you're red, white, black
If you want freedom then we're all like Nat
War, war (war), war, war
Declare war
It's time
Let the spirit of Nat Turner live forever



[Hook]
War is necessary, war brings pain
But war is necessary, war brings peace
Cause war is necessary, get your warriors up
Cause my niggas are war ready
War brings hate (Esco,  let's go let's go let's go!)
War is necessary, war brings pain (Esco, let's go!)
Get your warriors up
Cause my niggas are war ready
My niggas war ready

[Verse 1]
Staring at the face of my watch, its like a crystal ball
With the ability to make the issue stall
I told my man duck, cause I know where the missile fall
Cause the ice is a fortune teller for the rich or small
Went to my man's crib who dead and saw his picture fall
I picked it up, his voice whispered, "Nigga, ball!"
So I smoke the finest, (85 for the ocean liners?)
I do it for the have-not's, I'm at spot
That resembles screen savers on your lap tops
And niggas can't believe it like seeing that nigga Zab drop
I be in Cameroon, bandanas on silk Dior
Sip cream liqueur, green and blue FILA velour's suits
Boss smooth, the only thing I endorse duke
Stash houses, gamble, I don't sweat a lawsuit
All true in living God, we was here first
Parisian linen garb and cashmere shirts

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse 2]
Whose crew was realist? Shot up the movie theaters?
Times Square '88, whose crew was in it?
(Photographed was?) sittin' on wood wicker chairs
40oz in the lap, givin' off wicked stares
Punch out kings, bustin' pistols in the air
Hangin' out a Cutlass Supreme window like "Bitch, come here"
Girls cussing back at us with the fattest asses
Like, "Who you calling bitch?! Little black bastards!"
We had to wave the flag, here come they baby dad
Drug dealers in the crazy Jag looking crazy mad
They all thought they was sparkle, fucking killer men
But we was all Black seeds as Fred Williamson
It was so simple, now I'm reflecting in this gold Enzo
Face it, my favorite trinket was that Teddy Riley guy bracelet
So now it's fly shit I'm draped in, customized shit I'm makin'

[Repeat Hook]



[Intro: Nas]
Uh, if I can teach somethin' so be it
And hope somebody learn somethin' from it
And give it back

[Verse 1: Nas & Both]
They can't break me or shake me
They too fake to come kill me
Think they faith is with Satan
They mistake me I'm filthy
Rich off the ghetto medleys, so now they wanna dare me
It's gonna be a murder confront me, the burners are empty
Middle Passage I made it
I'm from the land of David
The Nazarene of Bethlehem they had me wrapped in blankets
Y'all bunch of backward gangsters
Y'all signin affidavits
Snitches with smiling faces, got you blowin trial, I hate this
Hopin' my child can see through this tryna be a good daddy
I was there when she was born and she'll be there when I'm buried
Kind of weird and it's scary
All my years have prepared me
What I fear is my temper, I see clear to the center
Right through a man's soul
Straight through his eyes, straight to his heart
I'm still alive, how did I make it this far?
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found
I guess it's just a warrior's way, uhh

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior song)
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (definition of a warrior)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum

[Verse 2: Nas]
Like King Nasir fightin' the British regime
I can't cope my existence is hope for younger teens who lost and they broke
Earlier this year I buried my queen in a gold casket
Your mother's the closest thing to God that you ever have kid
I'm askin', what would you do at your own mom's funeral
Wanna pick her up out of it, this can't be real
Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but I can't keep still
I can't go on, responsible for so many
Her last days at the hospital
Visits from family I'm tryin' not to bust shots at niggas
Wishin' death on other nigga's mothers ain't right but why mommy
She raised me in the projects alone
Her untimely exit from her, heavenly body
Got me ready to body somethin' quickly
Can't be happy, fuck a party she can't party with me
So your apologies are burnin' ya own souls
To the kids with no parents at home, grab a hold

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior song)
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum

[Verse 3: Nas & Both]
Fight 'til the fight is over, for my peoples I die see
When you thought they were soldiers they turned out to be nobodies
I think they out to get me, helpless was livin' sinful
If you was me all this pain I'm feelin' would bend and killed you (I'm a warrior)
It only made me stronger
But in my head it gets darker who wishin' evil on ya
Sometimes I wish I was dead
But I took heed to the cause (I'm a warrior, yeah)
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found
I guess it's just a warrior's way, uhh

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Nas]
This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior) to my warriors
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (definition of a warrior)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum
This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior song)
Warriors, baby, KrucialKeys! Braveheart y'all
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (definition of a warrior)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum

[Outro: Nas]
This to all my warriors, who breathe with the heart of a lion
To everybody that lost their mother, their father
Rest in peace moms!
My mother's last words: Never give up
A true warrior, who raised me in the hood, in a war
Love ya girl, y'know keep marchin'
Yeah yeah yeah, you never give up
To all my warriors, haha
Braveheart, Braveheart
Definition of a warrior, ha

[Verse 1: Nas]
They never realized how real Nas is so decisive
It's just the likeness of Israelites mist that made me write this
A slight twist of lime rhyme, be chasing down your primetime
Food for thought or rather mind wine
The Don Juan features the freak shit
My thesis on how we creep quick
Fucking your wife, that ain't no secret
It's mandatory, see that pussy, they hand it to me
I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story
There ain't no drama that my niggas never handle for me
My gator brand is Mauri, walking through rough land before me
Where the snakes put a smile on they face
Hoping and praying I'm stuck
Scoping, they lay in the cut, weighing my luck
Player haters play this in cell blocks and rocked stages
Winking at some females cops with cocked gauges
Really, it's papers I'm addicted to
Wasn't for rap, then I'll be sticking you
The Mag inside the Triple Goose
Face down on the floor's the routine
Don't want hear nobody blow steam
Just cream or it's a smoke screen
Imagine that, that's why I hardly kick the bragging raps
I zone, to each his own and this ghetto inhabitant

[Chorus: Nas & Foxy Brown]
Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways

[Verse 2: Nas]
Now, how can I perfect this? (Uhh, what?)
Living reckless, die for my necklace
Crime infected, driving a Lexus with a death wish
Jetting, checking my message on the speaker
Bopping to "Mona Lisa", brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa
CD cranking, doing 90 on the Franklin D. Roosevelt
No seatbelt, drinking and thinking
My man caught a bad one, son, niggas is frightened
Secret indictments, as on to one seeking enlightenment
My Movado says seven, the God hour, that's if you follow
Traditions started by the school, not far from the Apollo
My 'fuck tomorrow' motto through the eyes of Pablo
Escobar, the desperado, word to Cus D'Amato

[Chorus: Nas & Foxy Brown]
Gotta watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways

[Verse 3: Nas]
Some niggas watch you (uhh)
See you when you think you on the low, ain't hard to spot you
You swore to keep it real after you blow
Three keys, new V's, went to Anguilla with your ho
Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat getting the dough
Them old timers advise you to them problems that's ahead
Drama with the Feds, not listening, just bobbing your head
Your Rollie shining, thinking to yourself 'nobody's taking mine'
At the same time, your ho is getting snatched from behind
Put in a van, "Where's the hundred grand?", strippin' her hand
From all the ice, wouldn't you know
You knew these niggas all your life
What made them mark you victim?
You fucked up somewhere down the line
Now they had to target your Wisdom
She took 'em to your place, straight to your safe
You doubted it could happen, sick of yapping
Jump in your ride, headed to your side
Puffin' ganja, get to your crib, can't find her, just a reminder:
Shouldn't have your stash house where you crash out
Could have passed out, your coke was gone, now you ass out
Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes

[Chorus: Nas & Foxy Brown]
Gotta watch dem niggas that's close to you (uhh)
And make sure they do what they supposed to do (what, hah)
'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you (uh)
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that's close to you (uhh)
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you (uh-huh)
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways (uhh)



"It's much more than a march
It will be the beginning of a movement
Millions more movement; let us begin"

"Tell us what you hear"

[Nas]
Dear people of the globe
I hope that you're in good health
By the time my voice hit you
I hope it all is well with you
My mission is to bail with you
Touch upon some real issues
Senators, Government Officials
Sit at the conference and listen
Have a Coke or mineral water and say I'm reminiscing
George L. Jackson, Malcolm X last wind when I'm rapping
Americans, Africans, Asians, Russians, and Arab men
Send your clergymen to journey with Nas from Queens, projects
I promise an unforgettable experience
Compare me with, Amenhotep get in more debt
History was stolen, get in my zone
What makes the powers that be, less gangsta then Al Capone?
The Rosetta stone was stolen like Chicago was
Think I'm a thug?, let's talk about some conquerors
Napoleon, Sun Tzu, Genghis Khan
Hitler, Edi Amin, Attila the Hun
Let's bring back to the cat that invented the gun
From the Indians all the way to the Pentagon
I'm sitting on Capitol Hill
I'm composing this rhyme, guaranteed to make all of y'all feel
The beauty that was trapped under siege
Believe in yourself you'll be free, take it from me

[Voice Samples]
"We will not surrender or we will not back down, we keep overacting"
["Throw up a fist for black power" --Nas
"Tell us what you hear"
"Why do we march? to protest Government policy
We march because it's time to fight back
We march for education"
"Throw up a fist for black power" [--Nas
"Tell us what you hear"
"Why do we march? we march to save the soul of America"

[Nas]
The rejection of what's right could mean you in denial
It either breaks you or makes you becomes hostile
I swallow many lies before tasting the truth
In the beginning there was darkness, beautiful you
How will life be without night?, no tranquility?
No way to get away and rest, no stability?
I can't see the sky without the moon and the stars
The sunlight blocking everything, the king I'm in raw
People worship the Madonna in the shrines in Spain's
I'm proud to share the same blood type in veins
The holy mother -- the loneliest color remains
Can't be tampering, diluted the chains
They try make you not want it, make you run from it
The wickedest men, want the ebony punished
It's so seductive, it's sensuous in my clutches
Hot as fire when Moses saw burning bushes
So abused and misused and mistreated
Naked men wanna get drunk and get weed it
People wild when she comes out pull out and party
Catch her body, fornicate some start beef
Chain reaction cause it's in the air
The lost tribe scattered everywhere
From the North thru West Hemisphere
Scientist and Archaeologist conceal the obvious
The dead, living and little children over time of this
Obsession, caressing, every essence of magnetism
Every organism when it come to it
All question about Resurrection and your connection with God
It's answered with the beast in your heart

[Voice Samples]
"We will not surrender or we will not back down, we keep overacting"
"Throw up a fist for black power" [--Nas
"Tell us what you hear"
"Why do we march? to protest Government policy
We march because it's time to fight back
We march for education"
"Throw up a fist for black power" [--Nas
"Tell us what you hear"
"Why do we march? we march to save the soul of America"



[Intro: Mykel]
Where there's life there is water
We depend on Mama Nature
There's a message for tomorrow
Everything connects to you
Some say soon it will be over
You can see it in the weather
Out of tune with Mama Nature
What you do comes back to you

[Chorus: Mykel]
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone

[Verse 1: Nas]
Uhh, uhh
Confucius, Confucius, Sigmund Freud
And Farad Muhammad, is it evolution or God?
Searching for the truth is a threat
Seems the closer we get to the truth State Troopers or Feds
Come out to silence you, my house in Malibu probably tapped
Cause living next door to Demi Moore, plus I'm black
Plus I want vengeance for the poor who's attacked daily
Patriot Act never scared me
Jake in the Taurus, sticky in the jar-as
Niggas I'm with got warrants
America's browning, 20 years from now every town'll be brown and Latin
An African looking Manhattan
I'ma tell you what I seen with my three eyes
Word to me, not a hoax back in '99
A spacecraft in the skyline
In L.A. in daytime, ask Horse if I'm lying

[Bridge 1: Mykel]
Every mother every father
Raise your sons and your daughters
With respect and with honor
From the seed comes a fruit
It's an unbroken circle
All of life is universal
And we're all in the struggle
If I know one thing is true

[Chorus: Mykel]
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone

[Verse 2: Nas]
Evidence remains in debate
Documents of our own Air Force base
Additional terrestrial information
Other planets with life population, my observation
Scientists study pictures of a flying disk
Right on earth anthropologists are finding shit
Visitors probably live with us, they can mimic us
It's sort of what we're seeing in the cinemas

[Bridge 2: Mykel]
Take a look in the mirror
And see the bigger picture
It's good to be alive
(It's good to be alive)
Nobody is an island
We are part of an environment
Only way we're gon' survive
Is if we harmonize

[Chorus: Mykel]
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone

[Verse 3: Nas]
Reginald Lewis, the black billionaire
Before Oprah, Bob Johnson, how'd he disappear?
Conspiracy theories, UFOs in the air
I've seen it with my own two eyes, and I swear
Like Warren Buffet, real money I'm just trying to touch it
The diamond encrusted shit, live illustrious
Cause we was deprived of it, suffered
Now we pop to prove anything's possible
My pimp strut was invented when they whipped us
Now we diddy bop just to show you that our strength's up
Just when niggas 'bout to see they cut
Global warming about to burn us up
Niggas never really seen paper in this world
American blacks, the teenager of this world
Give us 20 more years to grow up, already geniuses
What I mean is this
I used to worship a certain Queens police murderer
'Til I read the words of Ivan Van Sertima
He inserted something in me that made me feel worthier
Now I spit revolution, I'm his hood interpreter

[Bridge 2: Mykel]
Take a look in the mirror
And see the bigger picture
It's good to be alive
(It's good to be alive)
Nobody is an island
We are part of an environment
Only way we're gon' survive
Is if we harmonize

[Chorus: Mykel]
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone

[Outro: Nas]
Ayo I'm American born, love America
Love my people, love all mankind, all nationalities, you know
I think it's just recently where everybody just started to feel
Like there was an elite group that runs everything
And everybody else was sheep, ignorant
Making all ethnicities, colors and creeds
Niggers, blind to what really is going on
So I say take off the wool from your eyes
Out with the old America in with the new
End all racism, all injustice, all oppression to poor people
Any people anywhere in this planet
Let's come together: a new day is rising



[Intro: Kenny Loggins sample]
Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

[Break]
To my dogs.. wherever you are

[Verse 1]
Whattup Big? You know shit is rough after you slid
You in God's hands now, keep a place for me kid
Ain't nuttin' changed, still Party and Bullshit
We used to fuck R&B Bitches and see who rhyme sickest
For every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out
Machine Gun Funk, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts
You came to my hood, we was broke
I wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gunsmoke?
Still on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so
'Cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto
But fuck it black, you livin' your life, through your loved ones
Peace to your daughter and your newborn son
It used to be fun, makin' records to see your response
But, now competition is none, now that you're gone
And these niggas is wrong, using your name in vain
And they claim to be New York's king? It ain't about that
It's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you
Joke with you, happy we on top, the most official
Ain't too many real ones out there, I feel some but doubt they're
Capable to take it where you took it to
I missed your wake not 'cause I'm fake
'Cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way
I woulda stayed so long with so much to say
I had to put it in writin' to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin'
Tellin' me to pay my respects and move to the side
But I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by
You can't kill nothin' that's Ready to Die
You was like God to us in the form of Allah

[Kenny Loggins sample]
Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

[Chorus]
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive

[Verse 2]
(Thug Life never die..)
Dear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop
And use teeth to bite off beer tops and Pour Out a Lil' Liquor
You was more than just the wildest nigga
2Pacalypse, I understand your style, nigga
It's goin on the third year, since you've been gone
On the East and West Coast the same shit is goin on
The industry be talkin', offendin' me often
They don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin
I can relate, shootouts and court dates
All Eyez on You, niggas in your face invadin' your space
You asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up?
How long would I ride before I fold up?
How did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?
You predicted it in every line, all in your flow
There could Never Be Peace I have to quote
Can't believe I heard my name on "the realest shit you ever wrote"
We had words 'cause the best supposed to clash at the top
But kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped
In NYC, at MTV, people watched
We was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep
Think about how us real niggas would be
If we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?
You was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified
Like the son of God, when Lucifer lied
And make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?
But Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link
Will there ever be another MC as nice?
Will you return to us like the resurrection of Christ?

[Kenny Loggins sample]
Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

[Chorus]
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive

[Verse 3]
I wonder what the Commodores went through on tour?
Did Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?
What has Al Green seen, that made him religious?
Was it the drugs, put an end to the music business?
If so, should I put out the indo right now and write down
A plan and pursue my dream, turn my life around
'Cause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream
I'll need a extra Uzi ridin' through my own hood in Queens
It be the ones you always knew, that want it on
Tellin' everybody it was him, that you fronted on
Thought we walked a million miles it was just twenty
Not used to walkin' in the path of legit money
I thought I made it but we only took baby steps
Up the success ladder, where they pay me checks
To my clicks when I got it I said "Baby bless"
That was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess
We in the 90's and finally it's lookin' good
Hip-Hop took it to billions, I knew we would
A lot of ups and downs in the game
Could lose or gain a couple pounds tryin' to maintain
One day you here, the next you not; when you around niggas, check 'em out
Some is 'bout it, most individuals plots
And run the spots, some choose to stay to theyselves
While others have no cares and stay in jail
More than 50% of us endin' up with holes through the chest
Through the head, through the gut it shows
The future for us young shooters and old killers
Who become rich as dope dealers?
Nothin' left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments
Thug coaches with subs sittin' on the bench; either that or rap
We want the fast way out of this trap
Whether it be 9 to 5 or slangin' crack
To my deceased Gods wishin' I could bring you back
But life is a dream and y'all taught me that

[Kenny Loggins sample]
.. always survive.. but why?

[Outro]
Always survive, always
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive (no matter what)
Still, we, will survive (no matter what)
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my niggas just stay alive

[Intro: Nas]
Yeah..

[Chorus: Nas]
Ayo, it's poison: ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Niggas up in my hood be gettin' shot, given poison

[Verse 1: Nas]
In hospitals, shots riddle the block, little
Children and elderly women run for they lives
Drizzlin' rain come out the sky every time somebody dies
Must be out my fuckin' mind, what is this, the hundredth time?
Sendin' flowers to funerals, readin' Rest In Peace
You know, the usual, death comes in threes
"Life is short" is what some nigga said
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
And funny how these black-killer companies is makin' money off us
Fast food, Cola, soda, Skull and Bone crosses  it's all poison

[Chorus 2: Nas]
Ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Sisters up in my hood try to do good, given choices

[Verse 2: Nas]
When pregnant, drop out of school or have abortions
Stop workin', hopin' that they find a man that will support them
Up late night, on they mother's cordless
Thinkin' a perm or bleachin' cream will make them better, when they're gorgeous
White girls tannin', liposuction
Fake titties are implanted, fake lips, that's life destruction
Light-skinned women, bi-racial
Hateful toward themselves, denyin' even their blood
I don't judge Tiger Woods
But I overstand the mental poison that's even worser than drugs

[Chorus 3: Nas]
Yo, it's poison: ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Radio and TV poison, white Jesus poison
And any thoughts of takin' me down is poison
Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint 'em, PLAOW!

[Interlude: Nas]
Never to worry, all the wrong-doers got it coming back to 'em a thousand times over
Every dog has its day, and everything flips around
Even the most greatest nation in the world has it coming back to 'em
Everybody reaps what they sows, that's how it goes
Innocent lives will be taken
It may get worse, but we'll get through it, y'all, be strong!

[Verse 3: Nas]
The China-men built the railroad, the Indians saved the Pilgrim
And in return the Pilgrim killed 'em
They call it Thanksgiving, I call your holiday "hell-day"
Cause I'm from poverty, neglected by the wealthy
Me and my niggas share gifts every day like Christmas
Slay bitches, and party everyday like this is the last
I'm with my heckles, connectin' and we hittin' the lab
This is my level, fuck if it get you mad

[Chorus 4: Nas]
It's all poison: all of my words to enemies, it is poison
Rappers only talk about keys, it's all poison
How could you call yourself MCs? You ain't poison
Think about the kids you mislead with the poison
And any thoughts of takin' me down is all poison
Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint 'em, PLAOW!

[Bridge: Keon Bryce]
What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga
What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga

[Verse 4: Nas]
This nigga Ike with the Iverson jersey, light-skinned with herpes
Fuckin' sisters in Harlem, Brooklyn and D.C
This is the problem, cause he never tell 'em he got it
From lettin' fags suck him off, Rikers Island in '93
Drives a Benz, hangs at all the parties
All the concerts, backstage where the stars be
Rockin' they shirts in bitches faces like clockwork
What's your name? Where you from?
Chain blingin', thinkin' girls everywhere is dumb
Takin' pride in ruinin' their lives
So they could never have babies and they could never be wives
He never used a condom; give him head? He got ya
Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDS
I contemplate, believin' in karma
Those on top could just break and won't be eatin' tomorrow
I know some bitches who be sleepin' on a nigga's dreams
They leave; when that nigga blow, she the first bitch on her knees
Knowin' dudes that's neglectin' their seeds
Instead of takin' care of 'em they're spendin' money on trees
I pray for you, deadbeat daddies
'Cause when them kids get grown
It's too late for you: now you old and you gettin' shitted on
It's all scientific, mystic, you know, the Earth and the stars
Don't hesitate to say you heard it from Nas
What is destined shall be
George Bush-killer 'til George Bush kills me
Much blessings, be healthy, remember:

[Bridge: Keon Bryce]
What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga
What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga

This is what it sounds like
When a thugs dies (pow, pow ,pow) (we wont cry)
This is what it sounds like
When a thug dies (pow ,pow, pow ) (tears from your mama's eyes)

When Im with my niggas this is how it sounds
It ain't nothin nigga give my niggas pounds
This is what it sounds like when Im with my hoes
Hard dicks bitch you fuckin with a pro
This is what Im thinkin when u bitch niggas plott'en
Im gonna kill this nigga right now I got him
This is what he say right before the lead hit him (yo please dont shoot)
Man fuck'em, did him
When the cops come this is what a rat say
He shot em 4 times and he ran that way
Now a nigga on the run, this what real nigga do
You can stay at my crib I heard what happened, come thru
A bitch or a nigga can help a nigga hide
Open up the front door and welcome u inside
Coward nigga want war, well then we gonna ride
Wit the pump and the 44 and catch a homicide

This is what it sounds like when a thugs die (pow pow pow) (your moms cry)
This is what it sounds like when a thug die (pow pow pow ) (mamas cry)
This is what it sounds like when a thugs die (pow pow pow) (tears from your mama's eyes)

At his funeral this is what u heard (oh my god oh my god)
Ya that was that nigga's bird
And that ***** is foul
Do u know that ho's style
When u was locked up she had another *****s child
The other *****s me, I knew that was his wife
What the fuck am I gonna do, bitch is begging for the pipe
And I was coming through on the reggy every night
But then this nigga came home I said it wasn't right
9 months later shit got crazy
***** flipped out when she said it ain't his baby
Slapped her up, gun butt her with the nine
Put it to her head til she told him it was mine
(you fucking bastard I'm gonna bury em 6 feet deep)
Heard he looking for me daily, carrying his heat
Now hes under the ground may he rest in peace
Cuz he was married to a ho and I was married to the street

This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (moms cry)
This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (moms cry)
This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (tears from youe eye)
This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (tears from your moms eyes)

Its been 2 years aint nobody catched me
Hennesy and pepsi, my Tech will protect me
Out of state made alot of cake, they respect me
Got a new identity, hoes want to sex me
Havin memories of my seed kind of stress me
Cuz my son is 2 and his appearance reflects me
Gotta new Lex GS chrome wheels nigga
Drove all the way home, man shit is real nigga
Got back to the hood it was raining and pouring
Knocking on this bitche's door like 3 in the morning
She knew I was comin, I saw a cop 2 of em running
Let off 4 shots then I caught 2 in the stomach
She set me up, the rain and the led wet me up
(pow pow pow) thats the sound of a thug dead cuz

This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (moms cry)
This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (moms cry)
This is what it sounds like when thugs die, pow pow pow (tears from your moms eyes)



Uhh, where am I going?
Where am I? Where the hell am I?
Yo, it's ill...

[Verse 1]
Yo, my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily, I find 'em just at the right time
Mac in my right arm, tequila bottle in my left arm
Like Christion, watching my life go
Cant do myself in
Wolves in the night yo, hell's men
Two revolvers, I can let 12 spin, hop in my Benz
Push it to the limit, buck-sixty, who wit' me?
My Cris', two L's, twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I ain't shit
No matter how much cash I sit wit'
Still gotta ask the Lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth, I was insane
So I drive to cool the pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin', I ain't saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas
Drunk, almost crashed, I'm going too fast
Highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview
If they stop me, I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo, nigga, watch me

[Hook]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'ma ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand, trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself, alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

[Verse 2]
Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell these niggas nothing though
Bullets wake 'em up well
Take 'em to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I ain't your mark, homie
It's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle, not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways
Put out the haze, blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in television
Hella women, jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas, expect kilos
But what they not seeing is police expect RICO
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up, blastin' A.C., going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice

[Hook]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
Yo, I'll ride to the end of the road, if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand, I try to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel I am already
When I'm drunk by myself, alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

[Verse 3]
The reason that I want to be alone
Tired of all the things that went wrong
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swig
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around, who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, rumors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all
Things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good, find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib
Tryna see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start to feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib, I'm tired...

[Hook]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'ma ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand, trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself, all alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

[Bobby Byrd:] ("GET INVOLVED!!!" GET INVOLVED!!!" GET INVOLVED!!!" GET INVOLVED!!!")

[Intro: Nas]
Hold up, hold up, hold up man, this is Nas, hip hop still dead
1980's, I need all my pioneers to set it off on this one right here
I asked where they are, here they are

[Verse 1: MC Shan (Nas)]
Hip Hop when niggas knew the art of war (Shan!!!)
Rough rhymes that's what gave the hard the core
Now it's all good best friends became gladiators
Matter fact you blow more steam than hot gladiators
Some niggas is ghost written but I ain't hatin (80's!!!)
Cause I still spit fire like the Son of Satan
Shan motherfucker and I'm Queensbridge bred
Check Myspace (Queens!!!) Forever will they bare my face

[Verse 2: Raheem from The Furious Five (Nas)]
Who said lightnin can't strike in the same place twice
Trailblaze the game, made for life stayed nice
Yeah you made the Top 50, don't mention my name (Here they are!!!)
I had you open before crack, cocaine grow-in
Before The Fever, before +Missy's+ first +Misdemeanor+
Before Run's, first pair of Adidas, got heaters
And I pop pop, pop, pop, heaters
Stop dealers, on my block was the first hot wheeler

[Verse 3: Doctor Ice from UTFO (Nas)]
You never knew (1980's y'all!!!) Somethin so butter could come from the gutter
I'm, Doctor Ice the diamond the cutter
Like, Jacob The Jeweler and Rick is The Ruler (UTFO!!!)
Boogie Down Kris is The Teacher but Doc run the schoolin
Y'all got y'all, sneakers and beepers, your dutches and reefas
We got our, eight tracks and sneakers, our hookers and reefers
My work is, never in vain, born to insert
So even when I'm buried, I'm still the diamond in the dirt, let's work

[Verse 4: Kangol from UTFO (Nas) {Ladies Screaming Kangol's name}]
{Go Kangol!!} Yeah what's up fam?
My chick for twenty years tried to cut your man
She tried to take the house, the kids, the pots and pans
I'm on to project Plan B, nigga fuck Roxanne!!! (Get focused y'all!!!)
Tried to take the pot I piss in, now the chick outta my system
The whooped niggas need to listen listen listen listen
Cock aim fire don't you miss 'em miss 'em miss 'em
And every chance you get you diss 'em diss 'em diss 'em diss 'em

[Chorus: Nas]
HEY!! Where are, where they nooooooow, huuuhhhhhooohhh HEY!)
{Aww man, make me feel like I'm back in the days with my cassette player, tape in the radio y'all!!!}
(Where are they now?)
{Your man Nas, I asked y'all where they at? The pioneers I got love for them man that's why I'm doin this}
{I got love for them man, so here they are two thousand and seven, yeah}
(HEY! Hit me! Where are they nooooooow?)

[Verse 5: Kool Moe Dee (Nas)]
Where am I? On high with a pen
Blessed manifest rhyme god transcend (Pay attention y'all)
You call him God's Son, I call him God sent
First the God sent me, then the God Rakim
How can Nas not win when the God sent him
To resurrect true rhyme God kingdom
You should say amen when you see me
When you pray I'm him then you believe me

[Verse 6: Sha Rock from Funky Four +1 (Nas)]
Yeah! Sha ready to rise, ready to blaze somethin
Mother of the mic so I'm here to claim somethin
I got the munchies for the vultures that crushed the culture
Yo Nas brought us back on this track so bring it back (They don't stop y'all!)
From dusk to dawn equip the mic on my palm
I bring the love so you can get it on
Got the books on lock, mother of hip hop
For realla, come under from some of you niggas

[Verse 7: Tito from Fearless Four (Nas)]
You cats is foul frontin like you hard as a rock
When these brothers were the buildin blocks, that made you turn up the box
Doug E. Fresh and The Get Fresh Crew, To Markie D and Cool Rock (Know your history y'all!!!)
Rest in peace to the Human Beat Box (Know your history!)
Like when I first heard Jay, Darryl and Joe, saw a UTFO
I knew right then and there I wanna blow
There need to be a museum where everybody could see 'em
Said everybody take some pedium, and get respect

[Verse 8: Grandmaster Caz from The Cold Crush Brothers]
You got another thing comin if you think me and my man ain't sellin
Got more gold than Mr. Drum and we sellin
Through Welcome To The Terrordome, niggas are ever wrong
That's why you get no ends, but just in case
You got a death wish, for flare for the dramatics
There's some static in the attic {?} hid it looking at it
I'm a 'matic, nice to the fifth power son and I'm still at it
I was about to flip power son 'til I saw a vision, Caz!!!

[Chorus: Nas]
HEY!! Where are, where they nooooooow, huuuhhhhhooohhh HEY!)
{Grandmaster Caz, y'all know what this is do y'all know what this means!!!}
{The fact, that each brother got on this track, the fact, that each sister got on this track}
(Where are they now?)
{To rap, took time out of there schedule, when y'all ain't even got no love}
{But they still givin y'all love, that's hip hop y'all}
(HEY! Hit me! Where are they nooooooow?)
{Give it up to the OG's the original gangstas of Rap, yeah}

[Verse 9: Linque AKA Isis from X-Clan]
Nas you had to ask Linque, where you been?
Rippin on the mics with the devilish grin
Sort of like a tack cause I stay under they skin
Cause when I open up my mouth I blow them chicks to the wind
Don't get besides yourself like you Siamese twins [Professor X:] ("This is protected!")
Still got the pen to make the ?message of sin? ("By the red, the black")
You bring it back I do it over again ("and the green")
Exposin those who pretend, stay on my grind 'til the end

[Verse 10: Dana Dane (Nas)]
First there was a tree and a MC grew and became (Brooklyn!)
Another rapper born in Queens, 9/6 the b-day
Moms moved and born {?}, dad hit the freeway
My young life was screenplay, better yet a clich (I can't believe it!)
To rap in the eight-tay, no lenses in the east-say?
They say we were a fad but fad don't add reggae
We played by the D-Day, eveyday, Eve's day
Capital D-A-N-E and hip hop, must be in it

[Verse 11: Pebblee Poo from Def Committee (Nas)]
C'mon! Well I'm the ?wa-say-why? with the with the same crew
First name Pebblee, last name Poo (Oh!)
Gina Parks? says a {?} I'm a leader, theiver, greeter
Last mark the game like Run and them Adidas (Do the history ya'll!!!)
I'm a real estate investor but, I still blessed her
Microphone teacher outta Alpha Four ?"Beavers?
Hold on I get deeper, dope b-boy speaker
Practice what I preach-a, DAMN I'm a keepr, huh

[Verse 12: Just Ice (Nas)]
Just the mic and make 'em stand up [RAW!]
Lyrics are legendary status so get ya hands up
Clap to the freestyle (Just Ice!) dance, but in the meanwhile
Cool calm collected, smooth that's how I get down
Then at the stage, hold 'em up like a twelve gauge
Page after page, all you see is a pure rage!
So pass the gat, grab ?taps? for the beat
Just Ice signing off [Whaaat?!] Yo I'm out y'all, PEACE!!!!!

[Outro: Nas]
Yo that's incredible man play that again!!!



[Intro: Nas (Redhead Kingpin)]

Awww man y'all ain't ready (Straight check it)
Here they are the remix, let's go

[Verse 1: Redhead Kingpin]
It's Kingpin plus two I'm on the guestlist fam
But if this dude ain't like thirty he don't know who I am
Boo boo my name, monetary gain is better than fame
But let's face it without the spotlight you thinkin Red is Eddie Kane
If I was drugs then I used to be a key
Now I'm a couple ounce, on the come up hustle me
Yeah, and hip hop man ain't no 401K

[Verse 4: Father MC]
Yo! First of all big up to Nas the killer rip spitter
The Q.B. hitter called this Far Rock nigga
Yeah I'm drippin heavy from my head to my feet
From the bars that I spit to my name on her cheeks
Catch me on the mixtape, Bentley with the Queen draped
Pilot on deck G5 when I gotta skate
Let you know when I'm out on the dough that shows I'm sellin them
My LP's drugs nigga be like runnin listen

[Chorus: Nas]

{Here they are , two thousand and seven they right here, yeah, they right here}

[Verse 5: Monie Love]
One baby drop two to the three
Is she out for the count UK mic deceased?
You never heard again from words not the least
I checked first set net worth mic relief
Remain calm more vowels spit battles
And associate the kid when they hustlin up the cattle
I don't care to give when they ride like a saddle
Hip Hop crowd well in doubt where are you now?

[Verse 6: Mike G. from The Jungle Brothers]
It's the Jungle Brothers (housin) with that fiiiiiive thousand
Blowin up your project housin, Baby Bam Lee just bouncin
Make me wanna crack a 40 ounce and, and straight get LOUD and

Aiyyo cool calm collected and my name is Mike G
And I'm reppin for Nas and my crew the J Beez!

[Verse 7: EST from 3XDope]
Eight bars, ten stars, fuck five mics!
I'm (The Source) and the boss, show you what it's like
To play bad mitten at the top of your position
Wit a whole lotta niggas wouldn't play but it's written
I'm the first to murk, chea! Representin Philly boy
The same kid that spit this wrote ?Baby Gram?
Nicholas one son the (Greatest Man) livin
True school be like e'ryday thanksgiving

[Verse 8: Positive K]
Pos. K! Uh, uh, still spits this summer
Came up like I hit the number, yeah y'all know me!
I'm not a stranger to y'all in the orgies
Squeeze ya dick up in ya in the ear as if ya for me

Plus I took ya to the "Bridge" like James Brown and Nas applaud me

[Verse 9: Krazy Drazy from Das EFX]
Miggity [microphone check], "Where Are they Now" Nas remix
Feel how real Hip Hop needs this

Look it up, hook it up, get the catalog
We your favorite rappers, rappers, rappin dog

[Verse 10: Mr. Do It All from Lords Of The Underground]
Yeah I go Nas, Lord Do It All
Me and you got something in common through Marley Marl
Burst in the bricks, talked to buyin ?leather?
Golden aged flows, you sound undiscovered
I do this with a passion, spray-paint tag in
Hip Hop's alive, and I'm the breathing dragon
On the stage whylin, jumpin and laughin
It's Lords of the Underground and that's if you're askin!

[Verse 11: Chip Fu from The Fu-Schickens]
Yo! I strip the booth anytime my lips move
And it spews, my screws and they loose, I'm a move and it's proof
Now give me two minutes I'm still wicked and still kickin it
With skills built and hot {?} you can't step in my shoes YO!!
When I'm in the mood, when I'm in the booth and whenever when you
I spit phantom in a boost you better just prepare to make room!
Nas give me eight bars, eight stars Escobar
Yo we rule, and we still ain't got nothin to prove, yo!

[Verse 12: Dres from Black Sheep]
For the second I'm wreckin I got you double-checkin
For me to flash your big chain wheeler, shiny weapon, step in and holla

The wack gets spit lot, the man bullshit stop
Yo they call lot and I accept the invitation
But I not try and snitch upon my ?inclamation?
On the real God, I'm good, a brother been in mediation
And my mind has been kenotic, kill the pres led a netion, Dres

[Outro: Nas]
Aiyyo Chi Ali hold ya head up in the peniles
This your man Nas, here they are
Unbelievable, Hip Hop is Dead
Let's see what happens aight!!!



[Intro]
This is a Core DJ Exclusive....

[Nas]
Ayo, check it out, this is Nas
Is Hip-Hop dead or is it still alive? Ha ha
Well, check it out
Right about now, I'm ridin' with my homies from the Westside
(West Coast)
Showin' love
(West Coast)
I asked where are they now?
(West Coast)
2007, they right here, yeah
(Where are they now?)

[Breeze]
Yo, it's time to rhyme, keep it in mind, I'm gifted
With the strength to go the length, and if its
Rough enough to keep the crowd wonderin'
Breeze and L.A. Posse (Where are they now?)
Still layin' in the land of the palm trees
Warm breeze, sippin' on Dom P, still chillin' with King T
Slowed on MCin, pass the series green
Gettin' money off the words I spit, yet still gee-in'
Still the young son but now a nigga got a baby girl
Tryin to raise her right and guide her through this crazy world
Still got a slow flow and fast raps know
Reppin' twenty years, still gettin' ASCAP checks
Still, spittin' the truth when I mentor the youth
On how to be professional when they step in the booth
And never cuppin' the mic so you can hear me clear
Nas wondered, yo, where are they now?
I'm right here, G

[KAM]
Goddamn, that nigga KAM back on the scene
With the O.G. West on the same team
Hittin' corners in a Six-Trey Chevrolet
Ragtop Impala, gettin' dollars every day
For pushin' heavy yay to this rap shit
Fuckin' with niggas I done put L.A. on the map wit
So that the legacy lasts long
We're givin' it up for all the homies that done passed on
And you can check Bobcats file
He can tell you who we are, what we did and where we at now
This bullshit, niggas tired of that
Fools runnin' they mouth, so where the Southside riders at?

[Hook: Breeze, KAM, Nas, King T]
Everybodys talkin' about the South and the East Coast
But what about the West Coast?
(West Coast)
Everybody talkin' about this South and the East Coast
But what about the West Coast?
West Coast, yeah, Nas's ridin' with you right here
(The who?)
West Coast

[King T]
Hey, watch it resurrect from the jump
House shoes, Khaki suit, riot gauge pump
Black Raider hat with Bitch Please on the side
Central and Greenleaf, 1989
Just in time, King T pushed the line
The G's had to have it, Eazy and Dre had it
I was a damn fool, now dudes wanna act it
(Where are they now?) He's still active
We go back like the Jheri Curl shag
When Pooh was from the Gate, Bobcat was from the Aves
I was in that green 6-4 with the rag pull back in slow motion
T-La showboatin'
They lookin' for that West Coast Trojan
Thought to be in exile but I'm just posted
Blessed to be the best to crack the West Coast open
King T-La back, muthafucka, it's a wrap

[Candyman]
The C-A- to the N-D-Y-The-M-A-N
I still melt in your mouth, not in your hand
I love to hear the story, again and again
But it originated from this man, The Candyman
Damn, it feels good to hear my West Coast peers
Makes me wanna shed a tear for the ones who ain't here
I was just a young player in these Westside streets
Motivated to be innovative like Ice-T
King T, Toddy Tee
R.I.P. to Mixmaster Spade, MC Trouble, Rudy Pardee
And it's a trip to witness trap rap
When Im on the first album cover with Eazy-E doin' that shit way back
Hell yeah, we need a new West, Dirty South respects
I remember doin' shows out there
They never tripped off the Westside
Spend all their chips at the Best Buy
Groovin' like they just don't care

[Threat]
No mistakes, cant get away
Dumpin' with them funky rhymes
Yep, that's MC Deadly Threat
They play him on the radio all the time
I love my folks, I love my G's
They can't kill Cali, they love my weed
West Coast done it, East Coast did it
Then the South came wit it like let's go get it
Red Ghost did it like the ones before me
The batterram came and took all the glory
I got an Army like Uncle Jamms
K-D-A-Y bumped the jam
Bobcat, Battlecat and DJ Pooh
L.A., S.C., but we say Zuu
It still never rain or snow in Cali
We're gettin' blunted in the back of the bowling alley, like..

[Hook: Breeze, KAM]
Everybodys talkin' about the South and the East Coast
But what about the West Coast?
(West Coast)
Everybody talkin' about the South and the East Coast
But what about the West Coast?
Where are they now?

[Ice-T]
This is it, dope from the fly kid
Iceberg bang for the West, servin' a life bid
Westside nigga for life, ride or die
I get so gangsta, I stay so fly
Saggin' my Khakis, reppin' my flag
Nigga, break out the gun, bitch, let's play tag
Every day in the street, somebody calls me Cube
I tell em that's my loved one, but its Ice-T, dude
I come from that Crenshaw strip, ya heard?
Its way Cripped up, chrome when the 6-4 lift up
It's hard to rock a party, L.A. don't like nobody
Niggas rather pop the trunks and dump shotties

[Sir Mix-A-Lot]
I'mma show my nigga Nas what I got in my garage
Yeah, my publishin' is large, water fountains in my yard
The Posse left Broadway to get em on the glass
I got class, but still I like a fat ass
Mix-A-Lot sheenin' with this S-Class gleamin'
Aggressive pimp leanin, marked the game like a demon
From TVs to movies, Hollywood use my shit
Seven-figure years keep comin. Who's your pimp?
F430 with these black paddle shifters
This may not uplift ya but I'm still takin' pictures
And I'm lovin' all you sisters, Mix'll never disrespect ya
Westside vet; you need your paper? I'll connect ya

[Hook: CMG from The Conscious Daughters]
Everybodys talkin' about the South and the East Coast
But what about the West Coast?
(West Coast)
Everybody is talkin' about the South and the East Coast
But what about the West Coast?
(The who?)
The West Coast

[CMG from The Conscious Daughters]
It's the rhyme-spittin' kitten youre never hittin
The legendary, all-time great phenomenal female
Monarch, hittin' charts
Flowamatic nine spitta shoot like darts, blowin' bitches apart
It's The Conscious Daughters, still stompin' over soil
Holla at your folks, the females is royal
Bay Area OGs, still gettin' cheese
Like we sidin' on the block with 'Pac and Eazy-E



[Produced by No I.D.]

[Verse 1: Nas]
At times I window watch at the Wynn hotel
Lots of thinking happens in life, will I win or fail?
Mind of a shooter, CFO also
Ethiopian food flown in, it's unlawful
Money is attractive, honey dress strapless
Agent Provocateur underwear: she's classic
Stroll up in the party: titanium black card
Romanian ladies like Casablanca, Casbah
'Cept we in the VIP area, that's ours
You know the real rap gods, typical trap star turned rap star
These old heads got stories, the days they was kings
I pray secret indictments don't take away their dreams
You 16, you could do 20, come home young
Catch 20 years when you 40? Holmes, you're done
What have we become? Rap stars from trap stars
Black gods to Ansars to Sunnis back to goonies
A 360 in the streets real grizzly
Shooters is cold, kid, the old shit was learning
Student enrollment to focus, yet hooligans roll with
Toasters to pop your medullas off of your shoulders
This ain't The Truman Show; it's the human show
Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle
Chewing on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
It's U.S.A. against the gangsta, where's the love?

[Chorus: Cocaine 80s]
Love, I'll trade you love
I've traded fire with you long enough
Is that all you brung, without love?
That's fucked up, but I saved your soul
Roll that up

[Verse 2: Nas]
Sometimes I sit on the bench just to watch the game
Feet on cement, there ain't a mobster living I could name
Who made it out rich, in his absence I do not proclaim
To not have a heart like wild animals not tamed
Maybe just a typical thug nigga was my rank
'Cept I had a vision above niggas, what I think
It's crazy how many brothers come where I come from
Some made it out big, some dead, some unsung
Shots for soldiers on 23 hours lock-up
Younger generation, they want to mimic and mock us
Laughing, separating themselves like they not us, like
"Cops'll look at you like they look at me? That's preposterous"
Ain't it gangsta how your man made it? I'm humble
One gun, one crazy ass nigga, that's Jungle
Now we having babies, 'cause growing up it was just us
No uncles or cousins to fight with us, we was fucked up
But still it was beautiful, the love is mutual
Even though me and Jung ain't show up to your funeral
I hold your son hand, tell him he the man, we love you
Your pops was king, you have a whole lot to live up to
The G is in your genes, already you tuck
Inherit your dad's swag, his George Jefferson's strut
Stay flyest, they gon' want to know what in your diet
Don't be surprised if they want to check your shit and your vomit
Tell them you let it marinate, they swear you made them a promise
No matter what they do, you just stay a man of honor
I'm a street corner nigga, New York Knicks loyalist
Corona sipper, pass it, I'ma blow it with you
It ain't The Truman show; it's the human show
Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle
Chews on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
Young brother go and get your paper, I got love

[Chorus: Cocaine 80s]
Love, I'll trade you love
I've traded fire with you long enough
Is that all you brung, without love?
That's fucked up, but I saved your soul
Roll that up
... Roll that up



[Intro]
New Nas... woo!!!

[Chorus]
Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(Just ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(All my niggas gon' ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at? (yeah)
Where them dimes at?
(Fuck them other niggas)

Where them dimes at?
Where them dimes at?
(Word to mother, niggas)
Where where them dimes at?
Where where them dimes at?

[Verse 1]
I slow dance with the Devil
Snow setting in the bezzle
Mo' sipping, phantom, bumping Aaron Neville
Polo black scented, eyes squinted
Air Force One's, with my own pattern in it
Fresher than a star, glowing up in the galaxy
Pagan holidays, are way far from my reality
Fart through Evisu jeans, lethal green
Oliver peoples shades when I creep through Queens
With no AKs, I'm the ambassador
Robin Hood in the Aston Mart
Lot of blood gon' splash in war
Task force homicide, federalies gon' harass
But y'all ain't never seen nothing
Not a word not a hint, on the kid from the Project Bench
That went Sony-BMG, to that new conglomerate
Island Def Jam, guess how many dollars was spent
To get the best man, y'all niggas ain't silencing shit
Ya bitch been wanna polish the dick
The big Benz, I'ma model ya chick
With Zac Posen, cash froze her
Cats stroke her, once I smash it's over
Cold like ice, more chains than slaves
Dangerous ways, Poltergeist change the channel
Roll the dice, I bring change when I gamble
I could sell sand to a Arab, hiding my gun handle

[Chorus]
Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(Just ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(All my niggas gon' ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at? (yeah)
Where them dimes at?
(Fuck them other niggas)

Where them dimes at?
Where them dimes at?
(Word to mother, niggas)
Where where them dimes at?
Where where them dimes at?

[Verse 2]
The ill whip pusher, my spit wet ya
If you stand close to the woofer
Betcha get sprayed by my lecture
Any club with ladies or dimes, I'm a regular
Give it up smooth, I ain't begging ya
Intelligent brainiac, brains maniac
Back of the Maybach, taste that, don't waste that
Eat with my elbows top of the table
Street etiquette with speech impediments
And still see presidents, no matter who paid
Cause you ain't take the last dollar made
Long as they keep printing it, there's chances of getting it
Money's my bitch, and we stay intimate
Ask about Nashwan, could ask about Jung'
Ask about Bravehearts, and ask where I'm from
Q-Boro, specifically The Bridge
Don't ask no more questions, y'all know what it is

[Chorus]
Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(Just ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(All my niggas gon' ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at? (yeah)
Where them dimes at?
(Fuck them other niggas)

Where them dimes at?
Where them dimes at?
(Word to mother, niggas)
Where where them dimes at?
Where where them dimes at?

[Verse 3]
Whether chrome sparking or loan sharking
Busting rachets or numbers rackets or drug traffic
My funds are wrapped up, no concerns who has what
Financier, skull doo wrapped up
Mob life, prizefights, plasma TV's or first roll
Diversified dough in my circle
Amid the most sickest groom the proof swiftness
Numero uno, annuit coeptis
That's the language of our Latin ancestors
On the back of a dollar, the plan and the message
In the Rolls Royce like the King of Nigeria
My criteria, smoke cigars
Change rap like Jimi Hendrix changed Rock and Roll
With a broke guitar, diamonds flashing
Almost put a million cash in my mommy casket
Seen more green than St. Patrick, trick

[Chorus]
Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(Just ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(All my niggas gon' ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at? (yeah)
Where them dimes at?
(Fuck them other niggas)

Where them dimes at?
Where them dimes at?
(Word to mother, niggas)
Where where them dimes at?
Where where them dimes at?

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(Just ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
(All my niggas gon' ride with it)

Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at? (yeah)
Where them dimes at?
(Fuck them other niggas)

Where them dimes at?
Where them dimes at?
(Word to mother, niggas)
Where where them dimes at?
Where where them dimes at?

[Outro]
Just ride with it
All my niggas gon' ride with it
Yeah, fuck them other niggas
Word to mother, niggas



[Intro: Mano & Shahram Shabpareh]
Y'all niggas better not be coming around me with that fugazi no more, you know? Got that thang for your ass, you know?
(I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
I'm gonna have to leave you)

[Verse 1]
A vet stylin' in Met Gala, tuna salad from La Scala
Black sweats, swallow a lot of reefer
God, it hard to quit the bottom feeder, lobster eater
When I fast, I see Elijah's features
A million cash for a Nas feature
Nah it's cheaper, do it for free if you do it for me
52 bar verse if the beat is movin' me
Stumble through customs, coppin' Cubans at the Duty Free
Layin' on the most expensive beds, still I'm losin' sleep
Next to Jet's Beauty of the Week 1993
Chin-grabber, neck-choker, in-her-mouth-spitter
Blouse-ripper, ass-gripper, that dig-you-out nigga
I ain't gon' hold you, old head gave me old news
I don't owe you, shoulda heard when I told you
You are an extension of what I've worked hard to build
You believe in your own lies, can't be real
And the odds is that what you love can kill you
Like a heart physician who dies from a heart attack
I know the consumer behavior, I target that
You impressed with what they wearin', I started that

[Verse 2]
It's kinda terrific, the product of Slick Rick
Somebody woulda told me then I would come outta this shit rich
And start up a business, I woulda thought they was playin'
All them niggas I ran with, all that weight they was weighin'
A light bulb switched in my mind at the classes I cut
Just a spazz, puttin' wax in the blunt
The baddest I want, she wear Lipmatic to front
We building businesses, you can be mad if you want
It's bubbly 'til it's bubbles we see
Drinkin' like Dean Martin is nothin' to me
The spirits is somethin' I can't part and it's fun to be me
So cheers, here's to the Kanye production this eve
War of the Roses, it's war, baby
My nigga High said it's me, I drive 'em all crazy

[Outro: Shahram Shabpareh]
(I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna)

Hudson

[Verse 1: Nas]
Heard you got your master's
Did college up, never looked back, now that's what's happening
And it's good to see you made it out the hood
With a degree, a true man with passion
Now you could enter the so-called "White Man's Society"
And go right past 'em
Looking in the Wall Street Journal for your face
But it's always absent
There he go, that's him
Eating flan and ambrosia, watch on his arm, golden, laughin'
Try to get his attention, but he's flinching
Guess my grimy clothes threw him off, so I mention
We were neighbors some time ago
He was kinda cold, in this restaurant, full of his kind and more
He sighed, tried to look surprised, I know
His side of the city where he resides, so
I had to go, I heard him laugh hard at some sad black jokes
Hate so-called "intellectuals"
No balls, he suggests we vote
He stand all proud, speaking to correct his folks
He want to lecture folks 'cause he professional
And he suggest that we don't sell dope
And I guess it's true, but who the fuck are you?

[Chorus: David Rainer]
Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna tell me who I am?
Who are you, tryna tell me what I'm not?
Tryna tell me what I'm not
Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna box me in, tryna find who I am

[Verse 2: Nas]
I'm Idi Amin, I'm Marcus Garvey
H. Rap Brown, I'm Muhammad Ali
I'm Reginald Lewis, George Washington Carver
I'm Nas with incredible music, let's do it
Thinking of a master plan
Sipping on disaster, smoking on gangster
Watching niggas argue, chillin' on my bar-stool
With my Hell Up in Harlem hat in hand
With a girl named Pat
She more than a waitress to order your drink with
She divorced a banker and bought the bar
She got an automobile, she give an order to kill
You get caught and robbed, we could see your walk is off
You could lose your rhythm when you outta the gutter for a while
You easily go to soft from hard
Now we all about hustlers, number runners, hoes and sharks
And we all know the code of the block
And you talking some gibberish, anti-nigga shit
'Cause you marched back with Rosa Parks?
Brother, don't start, go build your Noah's Ark
You could float to the end of the world, and pretend what you not
But I know what you are
While I roll in my car, and I'm spending my knot
While my enemies plot, you ain't out of the shot
Matter of fact, you're an easier target
And I respect everything you accomplished
But I hope I never get old and talk that nonsense
So who the fuck are you?

[Chorus: David Rainer]
Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna tell me who I am?
Who are you, tryna tell me what I'm not?
Tryna tell me what I'm not
Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna box me in, tryna find who I am

[Outro: Nas]
She Queen of Nzinga
Winnie Mandela, Ida B. Wells
Why can't you tell?
Why can't you tell?



[Intro: Ron Artest]
Yo, Nas what up? Yo, Nas What up?
This your boy Artest
This is one track I won't rap on, I won't rap on
Go!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Heard you got your master's, did college up
Never looked back, now that's what's happening

Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna tell me who I am?
Who are you, tryna tell me what I'm not?
Tryna tell me what I'm not
Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna box me in, tryna find who I am

[Verse 2: Nas]
I'm Idi Amin, Marcus Garvey, H. Rap Brown
I'm Muhammad Ali, I'm Reginald Lewis
George Washington Carver, I'm Nas with incredible music
Let's do it, thinking of a master plan
Sipping on disaster, smoking on gangster
Watching niggas argue, chillin' on my barstool
With my Hell Up in Harlem hat in hand
With a girl named Pat, she more than a waitress
To order your drink with
She divorced a banker and bought the bar
She got an automobile, she gives an order to kill
You get caught and robbed
We could see your walk is off, you could lose your rhythm
When you outta the gutter for a while
You easily go to soft from hard
Now we all about hustlers, number runners
Hoes and sharks and we all know the code of the block
And you talking some gibberish, anti-nigga shit
'Cause you marched back with Rosa Parks
Brother don't start, go build your Noah's Ark
You could float to the end of the world
And pretend what you not, but I know what you are
While I roll in my car, and I'm spending my knot
While my enemies plot, you ain't out of the shot
Matter of fact, you're an easier target
And I respect everything you accomplished
But I hope I never get old and talk that nonsense
So who the fuck are you?

[Chorus: David Rainer]
Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna tell me who I am?
Who are you, tryna tell me what I'm not?
Tryna tell me what I'm not
Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna box me in, tryna find who I am

[Outro: Nas]
She Queen of Nzinga
Winnie Mandela, Ida B. Wells
Why can't you tell?
Why can't you tell?

[Hook: Xin Xin]
It is what is is, it ain't what it ain't
Am what I am, able to take care all of me alone
And put that boy on hold
Been a lot of duplicated
Makes no difference, love or hate it
Must stick to your guns
Because you're the only one
No one is going to hold you down like the way you do
And they ain't gotta lace 'em up, and walk in your shoes
Say what you say, it's nothing
Got nothing to prove
So, so who are you?
So, so who are you-u?

[Chorus: David Rainer, Xin Xin, Both]
Who are you? tryna tell me who I am? Who I Am?
Tryna tell me Who I Am? who I am?
Who are you?
Who are you, tryna tell me what I'm not?
Who are you? Who are you?
Tryna tell me what I'm not
Who are you, tryna tell me who I am?
Tryna box me in, tryna find who I am
Who are, who are, who are you-u?



[Nas]
Look here see
Pretty Mike shanked Two-Face Al over some gal
Found the body dead in the isles
Death by strangulation
Microphone cord, a dirty broad
Guess they'll never play it again Sam
Damn that was my jam
Now she's on the lam
She made it out with 200 grand
What a scam
While these two compete on who's the star of the show
Golden legs there makes off with the dough
I read the paper there with Joe the Butcher
"He said one glance is all it took ya
She's a real looker
They say her old mans a bootlegger
Transporting in any weather
And at this rate we'll never get her."
Fellas, think it's time to call it a night
All this talk of this mystery dame's gettin' me tight
Thought I saw her in my eyesight, right
Hate to spoil the party
"What are you guys havin', the same?
Waiter another round for the gang."
It's strange how I always felt outta place
Joe The Butcher's my ace, but in comes Freckle Face
So I said "See you later."
'Fore I hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers
He met them in Louisiana wrestling gators
An idiot can tell they're involved with the caper
So I pulled the revolver on my waist up
Between the patrol car and the gray truck
Behind the street lamp was a silouhette
White gloves and a real long cigarette
What do you know all this time she's got me in her scope
She spoke, says, "The devil got you guys by the throat
Your conspiracy theories won't work without evidence
That's the reason why Eric B. is not president."

Well what do ya say

Ya see?
Ya see?
Ya see?

Look here see
I know you got soul you're trying to hide it
How did you kill a man out in Cypress
One Eyed Charlie
He only hangs with the criminal minded
Says you guys did it doggy style is he lyin'
She says, "Walk this way, I'll tell you a children's story."
We hit the bodega got her a few 40's
We jumped in my ride we drove and she cried
Twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide
Swallowed it, whole bottle's half empty
Drinks like a fish now she's past tipsy
The truth came out as we got to her suave house
Chopped and screwed her mouth and sat me on the couch
I said, "It's gettin late, come on, give it to me straight
Who's ya sponsor lady?" She says, "Bill Gates."
What are ya born 77 or 78?
She says, "Nah it goes way to an earlier date
Slave times," claims the slaves said rhymes
But she fell in love with some fella named Clive
Who? "Clive Campbell from Sedgwick Ave, the Bronx."
Now she shows me the cash
I said who's Clive, don't play with me skirt
She said Clive Campbell
He's Kool Herc

Ah-ha!
Ah-ha!

Listen up sweetheart
Now we gettin somewhere
As she's talking, she starts vanishing in thin air
But before she dropped the money bag on the floor and died
She said if you really love me I'll come back alive

Hip hop is so **** dead!



Y'all know what it is
The streets named me Illmatic, for that I'm still at it
Can't hate us
Fellas

Vice behind me on the intersection
Sex and drugs, my anthology on perfection
Dress superb, admired by conspirers
Who wanna try me, but ain't high enough to four-five me up
Child of the eighties, y'all niggas is lazy
Complain about labour pains, nigga show me the baby
And my nigga Game, light another L, pass the bottle
Pro-black, I don't take cotton out of aspirin bottles
Yeah, I learnt my lessons, and heard y'all snitchin'
Witnessin' you rockin' with Nas, confirmed my suspicion
Green fatigues on, My niggas I bleed for 'em
I can show 'em the water, but can't make 'em drink it
And I can show 'em my fortunes but can't force 'em to think rich
And still I don't abort 'em ? when and if they sink quick
Ignore the ignorance, I rep the brilliance of Queensbridge
And pray to fans, let Murder Inc. live

I don't talk about my guns, nigga I just blaze

'Pac is watchin', Big is listenin'
While Pun talkin' to us, Jam Jay still spinnin'
To every nigga listenin'
I was supposed to be amongst kings, my Mom shouted out at my Christening
And while you still listenin', Shyne locked in a man hole
Cam got shot inside his lambo', sample, life is a gamble
15 years old red rag around my hand, My sisters used to laugh and call me 'Rambo'
Seen Eazy's legacy melt away like a candle
I rekindled the flame
Dre created The Game
Nigga with an attitude from the cloth I came
Young homie ate his way up from the bottom of the food chain
Keep the crown, clown, I rock an LA Dodger Fitted
I showed my ass at Summer Jam but New York was down with it
Now the ball's in my court, never dribble out of bounds with it
Behind the back to Nas, he alley oop to Jigga, nigga

Me and nasty puffin', this a classic, trust me
How you gon' pass the dutchie ? to them niggas that don't love me
I'm talkin' niggas that never wanted to see me on top
Same niggas that never wanted to see the Doctor's Advocate drop, flop, I think not
I'll fuck you rap niggas like virgins
Dre took my training wheels off his curtains
I don't need no encore, no claps, no cheers
The Game ain't over, this the beginning of my career
The ending of yours, the endin' of his
Like Flavor Flav's clock, I'm back to handle my biz
Nigga, it's Game Time, that was Dre's favorite line
Back when proof was in the booth and I recited his lines
And I still think about my nigga from time to time
Make me wanna call 50, and let him know what's on my mind
But I just hold back 'cause we ain't beefin' like that
He ain't Big, and I ain't Pac, and we just eatin' off rap
One love

I'll do Marsha's bit if you want, but it seems kinda pointless
I thought Nas was on point with his multis, the cotton line is a bit old though

[Intro: Anthony Hamilton]
Lies and the pain
Betrayal, life

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
In dangers face
Look what youre facing, gave your heart away
And all the remedies couldnt ease the pain
All the hurt and betrayal; need to get away
In a world so cold
You gain your life just to lose your soul
Never thinking twice bout what the future holds
All the lies and the games not worth fighting for

[Refrain: Anthony Hamilton]
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

[Verse 1: Nas]
Uhh, snitches and rapists in the street, crime to the fullest
Asking niggas if they got any extra nine bullets
They deny me that, they know the bullets they loan me
Be the same ones that probably had them lying flat
Stretched out, letter T, it's better to dead a beef
Than let it breathe, then we don't succeed
Cause then you gotta murder dummies
Waste your time, they allergic to money
I'm never squirmish to blood
We can thug and get out of hand; whats the options?
Only conclusion is shooting, bullets popping, hoodlums dropping
Fear any day that the Feds will come knocking
Was young and nervous, asking myself whats my purpose?
In the back of a paddy wagon, bracelets aching me
Pigs ignoring, I'm asking what precinct they taking me
These cops cant relate to me, death to prison, empty vacancy

[Refrain: Anthony Hamilton]
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

[Verse 2: Nas]
Thou shall not be selfish, real nigga commandments
Know a billionaire, he has everything but a fam
Guess how angry this man gets
Had so many bad chicks in his bed, strange sex, same sex
Has addictions that are sadistic, chain of events, habits
He puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick
Self-esteem needs boosting, alcohol consumption
Nicotine fusion, some athletes juicing
Pastors quote biblical chapters, Psalms
All along hes into bestiality porn
And its wrong, so I keep the Cali weed in the bong
And I'm strong but the female anatomy got me sprung
And these women need shoes and baddest cars and condos
Fine clothes and these fiends needs to get high
So they find dough to mainline dope, and y'all know

[Refrain: Anthony Hamilton]
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

[Verse 3: Nas]
So many vices, habits, mine of course, bad chicks
My response to any advice on what is the essentials of life
I'm just rebellious, not selfish
Guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is
I need the best things in life, that's women, thats cars, cigars
A vintage bottle on ice thats priceless
The other night, just in the emergency room
A patient said she needs to see a doctor soon
Doctor busy operating on a lady who's sedated
He can barely concentrate cause hes newly separated
His estranged wife likes entertaining her acquaintance
In the house they were married in, mad people waiting
Some young some old, heads and stomachs aching
Filling out an application cause they all need medication
But the doctor need love or a quick vacation
Calling up his travel agent, same time, premeditating
Murdering his ex wife; life, savage ain't it
Some need Xanax just to maintain it
We all need faith cause the world keep changing
Let go of the illusion, start some restraining

[Outro: Anthony Hamilton]
Oooooooooooh-ahhhhhhhhh....
Ahhhhhhhh-ahhhhhh-ahhhhhh...ahhh..
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (... hold on)



[Chorus: Aloe Blacc + sample + together]
("I wrote my way out")
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin' on empty, th'was nothin' left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and "I wrote my way" out

[Verse 1: Nas]
I picked up the pen like Hamilton
Street analyst, now I write words that try to channel 'em
No political powerjust lyrical power
Sittin' on a crate on a corner, sippin' for hours
Schemin' on a come up, from evening'to sun up
My man awaitin' trial, misdemeanors we younger
Courtroom prejudice, insufficient evidence
Jailhouse lawyers, these images still relevant
Flickerin' lights inside my project hall
Sickenin', the mice crawl all night long
And '87 Reaganism, many pages I've written on
Writin' songs about rights and wrongs and bails bonds
Master bedroom, bigger than the crib that I was raised at
I'm the architect like I wrote the code to Waze app
I'm driven, black Elohim from the streets of Queens
The definition of what It Was Written means
Know what I mean?

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc + sample + together]
("I wrote my way out")
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin' on empty, there was nothin' left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and "I wrote my way" out

[Verse 2: Dave East]
I really wrote my way up out of 6E
Develop relationships with fiends, I know they miss me
Before the metrocards, it was tokens, I did the ten speed
Never had wrote a rhyme in my life, what was a sixteen?
At sixteen, arrested in housin', trips to the mountains
Came right back, trappin' off couches, watchin' for mouses
Only tools we was posed with, had a spot, smoke lit
The hate is just confusion, pay attention how them jokes switch
Diadora was my favorite, the Mark Buchanans
Mama couldn't afford them, I learned everythin' on the border
That's a big 8, Clicquot parties with private dancers with no mixtape
Bumble Bee Tuna, now we could get steak
I persevered, composition, I kept it close
Competition near, I'm a Spartan without the spear
Three hundred rhymes, it was written before I wrote it
Opportunity knockin', might miss it, that window closin'
This poetry in motion, I'm a poet

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc + sample]
("I wrote my way out")
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin' on empty, there was nothin' left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and I wrote my way out!

[Verse 3: Lin-Manuel Miranda]
High speed, dubbin' these rhymes in my dual cassette deck
Runnin' out of time like I'm Jonathan Larson's rent check
My mind is where the wild things are, Maurice Sendak
In withdrawal, I want it all, please give me that pen back
Y'all, I caught my first beatin' from the other kids when I was caught readin';
"Oh, you think you smart?"Blah!start bleedin'
My pops tried in vain to get me to fight back
Sister tapped my brains, said, "Psshyou'll get 'em right back."
Oversensitive, defenseless, I made sense of it, I pencil in
The lengths to which I'd go to learn my strengths and knock 'em senseless
These sentences are endless, so what if they leave me friendless?
"Damn, you got no chill," fuckin' rightI'm relentless
I know Abuela's never really gonna win the lottery
So it's up to me to draw blood with this pen, hit an artery
This Puerto Rican's brains are leakin' through the speakers
And if he can be the shinin' beacon this side of the G.W.B and
Shine a light when it's gray out?

[Bridge: Aloe Blacc + sample + together]
("I wrote my way out")
Oh, I was born in the eye of a storm
No lovin' arms to keep me warm
This hurricane in my brain is the burden I bear
I can do without, I'm here (I'm here)
'Cause "I wrote my way" out!

[Outro: Samples]
"picked up the pen like Hamilton"
"I wrote my way out of the pro"
"wrote"
"wrote my way out of the projects"
"pick"
"picked up the pen like Hamilton"
"I wrote my way out of the"
"wrote"
"wrote my way out of the"
("I wrote my way")
"picked up the pen like Hamilton"
"I wrote my way out of the pro"
"wrote"
"wrote my way out of the projects"
("I wrote my way out")

[Spoken: Samples]
"Really, I saw, like, a hole in the rap game, so, if I wanted to put my little two cents in the game, then it would be from a different perspective."
("I wrote my way out")
"I thought that I would represent for my neighborhood and tell their story, be their voice, in a way that nobody has done it. Tell the real story."



Find a room to lock yourself in and close the door
It's some heavy concepts that we gotta explore
We gotta strip the word down rugged and raw
The rhetoric of martin king just saint around no more

Dave Bowie ain't here James Baldwin neither
They all were leaders
But they ain't help me get this porch two seater
A lawyer left the hood he never looked back
To be a fortune 500 C.E.O it took rap

So what if my pants sag with my hat turned back
The same swag got our merchandise flying off the rack
Marketing companies thats hiring blacks
Fresh hip hop lingo for your campaign ads

The controversy surrounds who could say it and win
Some niggas are full time some play and pretend
So fuck that no apologies on the issue
If it offends you
It's meant to
It's that simple

[Chorus]
Tryin' to erase me from y'all memory
Too late I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas)
Speak my name and breath life in me
Make sure y'all never forget me (y'all give me life)
'Cause y'all use my name so reckless
Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it)
And I love especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject
'Cause y'all my niggas

Yo I was thinking a little bit what would it take
To authenticate my nigganess
Ball ridiculous
26 inches when I call up the dealership
Yeah that's some nigga shit

We only out for our own benefit
We havin' too many kids
Recordings, welfare recipients
The infamous free clinics is the sickest shit
It makes me think what the hell they clean their syringes with

Everybody bleedin'
The cops are the demons
Courtrooms full of goons
Jail busher's leanin'

Handcuffs squeezed too tight
On you've life
If you fight they just give in
People used to do sit ins

They got Nigeria and Niger two different countries
Somehow Niger turned to nigga
And shit got ugly
The problem is we started thinking like the colonists
'til Noble Drew Ali
Started droppin' that consciousness

[Chorus]
My father was not a banker
Neither was my neighbor when it came to getting paper
Who the hell was gonna train us
A pressure couldn't escape us through the ages
We changed the basis of derogatory phrases

And I say its quite amazing
The use the ghetto terms developed our own language
No matter where it came from
Its celebrated now people are mad if they ain't one

[Talking]

[Chorus: x 2]



[Intro: sample]
We use the word everyday
Now we don't know the capacity of this word
Are we headed for conflict or not? (Yes sir)
Because we did not break down the capacity
Of the same what (the same word)
Brothers and sisters, this is why we hung up the consciousness
We've been taught wrong

[Verse 1]
Find a room to lock yourself in and close the door
It's some heavy concepts that we gotta explore
We gotta, strip the word down rugged and raw
The rhetoric of Martin King just ain't around no more
Du Bois ain't here, James Baldwin neither, they all were leaders
But they ain't help me get this Porsche two seater
A lawyer left the hood, he never looked back
To be a Fortune 500 CEO, it took rap
So what if my pants sag with my hat turned back?
The same swag got our merchandise flying off the rack
Marketing companies is hiring blacks
Fresh hip-hop lingo for your campaign ads
Controversy surrounds who could say it and when
Some niggas are full time, some play and pretend
So fuck that, no apologies on the issue
If it offends you, it's meant to, it's that simple

[Chorus]
Tryna erase me from y'all memory
Too late, I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas!)
Speak my name and breathe life in me
Make sure y'all never forget me ('cause y'all give me life!)
'Cause y'all use my name so reckless
Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it!)
And I love it, especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject, 'cause y'all my niggas

[Verse 2]
Yo, I was thinking a little bit
What would it take to authenticate my nigganess?
Ball ridiculous? 26 inches when I call up the dealership?
Aww, that's some nigga shit
We only out for our own benefit?
We having too many kids? We Claudines? Welfare recipients?
The infamous free clinics is the sickest shit
Make me think what the hell they clean they syringes with
Everybody bleeding, the cops are the demons
Courtrooms full of goons, jail buses leaning
Handcuffs squeezed too tight on youth life
If you fight, they just give in, people used to do sit ins
They got Nigeria and Niger, two different countries
Somehow Niger turned to nigga, and shit got ugly
The problem is we started thinking like the colonists
'Til Noble Drew Ali started dropping that consciousness

[Chorus]
Tryna erase me from y'all memory
Too late, I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas!)
Speak my name and breathe life in me

And I love it, especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject, 'cause y'all my niggas

My father was not a banker, neither was my neighbor

We changed the basis of derogatory phrases
And I say it's quite amazing
The use of ghetto terms developed our own language
No matter where it came from
It's celebrated, now people are mad if they ain't one

[Interlude: sample]
Every word we use, it has a capacity
And if you don't understand the words you're using
And understand the capacity of it
You are using words that is creating a destiny for you
That you don't even know, or even conscious of

[Chorus]
Tryna erase me from y'all memory
Too late, I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas!)
Speak my name and breathe life in me
Make sure y'all never forget me ('cause y'all give me life!)
'Cause y'all use my name so reckless

And I'm the subject, 'cause y'all my niggas



[Hook]
Yellow bird, yellow bird, yellow bird don't fly away x2
Not today

[Verse 1]
I'm in the game
Women only want my money or fame
Or they heard that Kendrick put them on blast
Or they feel I had so much ass
"What could he want from me? When he can have whoever he wants for company?"
The like, "he a slut, he a ho, he a freak
He my childhood crush, wish I met him '03
Now I need a simple life with a Christian man"
I was like, fuck it, get this money, get this power, keep slutting
Then I bumped into a cutie, looking at her
Not in a lusted matter, but in we need an introduction matter
Need her like fresh water from the springs of Florida
She hot for reasons more than one
Underneath the balling sun in Coachella where a I met her
She was staring
Since we began to hang, she my number one thing
Tell me your troubles, I'll listen, I'll try to numb your pain
You like to hug a king, I call you the color queen

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Oh burn me love, it's not a drug nor complexion necessarily
It's an expression the canary sings
If that canary don't sing, I train her
On the wings of love, I took the top from the Wrangler
She riding shotgun with her shades on, a day will come
I'll put a natural yellow rock on your finger
Born a queen, love looking at you, smile made me change up
You a bright sunny morning, sex, amazing
I said it since day one, we was meant to be
When you put my clothes on and started posing like a G
Playfully with my chain then you liked what you see
Loving how daddy do it, no one quite like me
No games, no side chicks, me and my ride or die chick
We see eye to eye, maybe not when your heels are five inch
You so fly, you so mine, it's me you dine with
Fucking Nas with, later on we spawn

[Hook]



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah y'all... New York City...
Tryna to see where I'ma go tonight...
The most famous town in the whole fuckin' world...
The other night, nigga was at Lotus...
I hit P and them
I was Dom P'ed up in there, you know...
But I found this new spot we went to the other night, yo
Check it out, check it out how it went

[Verse 1]
It was just cool like, smooth night with my jewels bright
Goons left, goons right, coupe with blue lights
Bad girls in black pearls, gave us cat calls
Took 'em back to the crib to break they ass off
In the loft, mixing hash and dro
Honey spreaded that asshole like a wide mouth bass
Sippin' wine out the glass, Teddy Pendergrass blast
When the phone ring, the house lights flash
Turned down the sound, let's get down to business
Shit about to go down with some foul niggas
What the voice said, "What up, pop? Who want it?"
I put the guap up, get the boy popped
He say "Son, stop, it's dudes you feedin'
Who feedin' other dudes, but they really not eatin'"
Dog, why you callin' me? This our food
You handle the mouths that it trickles down to
Niggas want beef, I want some of that cow too
But I'm in my princely robe, simply rich
Don't bother me with silly shit, call Rico
He said "It IS Rico, of all people
Gave his moms furs, called up the mayor
To get his crime pardoned, his son's godfather"
Said the nigga shot up my cars
Last night he laid for me to come out my doors?

[Hook]
Niggas always on that bullshit
To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip
Niggas always on that bullshit
Now your funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit
Niggas always on that bullshit
To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip
Niggas always on that bullshit
Now your funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit
You can't kill me

[Verse 2]
High, fly, send a fella loaf or glass
Fold up cash, you ain't heard the soldier's half
You speakin' hogwash, silly shit, Balderdash
I got the live sparked, Phillies lit, smoker's jacket on
The son of a Cap-ricorn, my dad's a don
What you think that he spawned? A slacker? Nah
Packed the 9's, yo this nigga's asinine
Smack your mom, relaxed and calm, then mack your mom
In a casket, you'll get your fashion on
You'll be in a suit and tie, you'll die
You'll make maggots turn to flies, fuckin' with Nas
Remember anyone can get it at anytime
Lames'll swear by your name, when they lie
Get hit with the lone star, ripped where your bones are
So tell me how yo' ass gon' run, from a C-Z-P-O-1?
In the midst of real steel movers, you a loser
Merk you wit your own shooters
All you want is a name, pissed and insane
My security system, my playspot a fireplace, listen
Then it goin' off, start spittin'
Niggas try to bring it where I live in
Trustin' you, knew where all of the cribs at
So we waited with the Sigs, blat, blat, blat!

[Hook]
Niggas always on that bullshit
To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip
Niggas always on that bullshit
Now your funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit
Niggas always on that bullshit
To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip
Niggas always on that bullshit
Now your funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit
You can't kill me

{*"You can't kill me" to fade*}



[Verse 1: Nas]
From Willie Lynch to Willie Hutch, right on, we Superfly
Made Gucci the shit, Louie too, suits and ties
Player trophies, pray to Goldie
Picture wax museums full of Black Panth's and triple OGs
Aunt Jemina hoes, historic horse shit
Girls from long time ago, stagecoach with the horse, kid
Witchdoctors, good ol' pickpockets
Sip moonshine, so-called coons, shines, and darkies
I love y'all, pyramids to cotton fields
To Wrigley Fields, forgotten men who did get killed
Crispus Attucks, the first blasted
Peace to the rich lady purse snatcher shot in the back
I know your hunger kid, I know they hung your dad
Burnt ya mama crib, I know that hurt you bad
Minstrel shows, from gold to shackles and back to gold
We act like we home, matter of fact, we are home
Bad attitudes, octoroon skin tones
Slave food turned to soul food, collards to neck bones
Betsy Ross sewed the first American flag
Bet she had a nigga with her to help her old ass!

[Interlude: Eban Thomas]
As James Baldwin says:
"You can only be destroyed by believing that you really are
What the white world considers - a nigga"

[Chorus: The Last Poets]
Ohh, no matter how hard you try
You can't stop us now (oh, no matter)
No matter how, hard you try
You can't stop us now (no)

[Verse 2: Nas]
Can't be stopped
Yo, on Dateline, the other night they showed hate crimes
Gave a blood time cause he fought with his canine
Bestiality, humane society
Go to China, see how they dine, see what they eat
Better yet, ask PETA, whoever, which animal makes suede?
If not for suede, would you have survived the Dark Ages?
Cannibal ways of the ancient Caucasians
Stare you like you're steak tartar, pinot noir
David Star on the chain of Sammy Davis
He helped pave the way for Southern crankers and them Harlem shakers
Now we gettin' our papers, they try to censor the words
And stop our money comin' but you can't escape us - haters

[Chorus: The Last Poets]
Ohh, no matter how hard you try
You can't stop us now (oh, no matter)
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop us now (no)
You can't stop us now



[Verse 1]
Girls I got 'em locked so similar to a prison
Hear this monster jam, I be callin' it 'GANGSTERISM'
I murder you for dope, I'm the street distributor
I'm homicidal, pointin' the pump, scope to shoot you
Street connects, Mob ties on East and West
We gouge out your eye balls if you seen too much
Hopin' out drops wit blings and stuff
Wit ball players wives, Mercedes 5
Dangerous lives and haters die rollin' with convicts
Conscience who tolerate no nonsense
Fake rappers in doo-rags, get shot-up at their concert
Your bitch bleed, bitin' her nipples with my chipped tooth
I drink her blood, like I'm Dracula, mack in the 6-Coupe
The sky becomes red, heard y'all niggas work with the feds
Doesn't matter, blood'll splatter, everybody must dead
I got urge for self-reinvention, but I'm old-fashioned
From the corner's with the winos laughin'
Dealers and five-o blastin'
Capitalist thoughts like Presidents
I'm burnin' Bush's, Nas the realest, it's nuttin' to fuck wit

[Hook: Uncredited Female (Nas)]
You think you know me but I... (Tell 'em Ma)
..Don't think so (Don't think so)
It takes a 'lil more than... (What?, what?)
What do you know about me?
(See what you don't know me you'll never will)
(And what you don't know will get yourself killed)
About me
(See what you don't know me you'll never will)
(And what you don't know will get yourself killed)
You'll never know

[Verse 2]
I smoke weed like them sixties rebellions, hippies on heroin
Spliffs inhalin', what I speak strictly for felons
Dippin' in their 6-4, hittin' the switches
Or sittin' in their Bentley Azure's, feelin' the riches
Or just ridin', truck drivin' Impalas, Denali's
I fuck with those but I lust for silver Ferrari's
I fuck hoes with the ceilings, have mirrors to watch me
My bed shaped like a pyramid, feelin' the dry heat
Spillin' Courvoisi', I'm half slave-master
Half Apache, half African, mutts is what I call us Black men
Lead astray, on drugs and cups of alcohol, cause back when
They let us off ships; the soul of man was lost or trapped in
But every ghetto, every hood, no matter where the town
It's all haunted, all on top slave burial grounds
Dead cooks, workers and maids, under this Earth in rage
Ancient whore houses that explain my sexual ways
Money and murder: interprets the American dream
The world loves a gangsta, I found my place in this thing
Royce's, diamonds and bosses, woman who're gorgeous
Traitors, killers and enemies, remorseless, we live this

[Hook: Uncredited Female (Nas)]
You think you know me but I... (Tell 'em Ma)
..Don't think so (Don't think so)
It takes a 'lil more than... (What?, what?)
What do you know about me?
(See what you don't know me you'll never will)
(And what you don't know will get yourself killed)
About me
(See what you don't know me you'll never will)
(And what you don't know will get yourself killed)
You'll never know

[Verse 3]
Gypsies, preachers, choirs, churches, liquor stores
The world is full of liars, curses, people rich or poor
Without God to worship, see we would be more lost
Gotta believe in somethin', or their would be no laws
A ghetto child occasionally blunted in Mansions
My cup overflow with Cristal, hundred exotic dancers
Niggas is plastic, ass gets jealous and passive
My pistol blast at; cowards, leechers, and rappers
Niggas I fuck with is 'Bravehearts', make G's
Before rap music to me, was wind blowin' the trees
Birds chirpin', rain fallin', perfect and free
But bitches saw my video and think they know me
These niggas bad talkin', claimin' they gon' do me
Stay out my path homey, you fuckin' wit a true G
Bitch +You Don't Know Me+

[Hook: Uncredited Female (Nas)]



[Verse 1: Nas]
Cup'a Hen', cup'a Goose, cup'a Cris'
White chain, colored watch on a wrist
Switch lanes in monster whips, ambience
Specially dressed, guess who? -- Nas, it's obvious
Step to bars, we just order dark liquors
Clear liquors, y'all niggas are s-e-x
Yes we get respected, eclectic messages
Left our brains, straight into a female's estrogen
She feels electric, her breasts she's touchin' them
Wet 'tween the legs from this thug seduction
N-a-s, bend they ass, over-spank it
Whisperin' she loves intelligent gangstas
Call fatties 'bubbles', call head 'skull'
Before I get either I need some Red Bull
She'll scream as I pushed in her freezing cold pool
When she piss she gon' bleed in the whole stool
That's how much I wanna bang and touch her pretty thing
Won't pluck no chicken wing, don't fuck with just anything
Gotta come up, run up and get touched up
Suicide, that's if you confront us

[Hook]
Don't talk, just hold your breath (breath)
Been here a while, only one nigga left (left)
And all'a y'all know my style (style)
I spend dough but I still let it pile (pile)
Mama shake ya thing
Coochie get wet while the bass beat bang (bang)
You put it on and on and on and on
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song

[Verse 2: Nas]
Uh, from a boy to a king
Love to rock diamonds and fancy rings
I'm a thoroughbred, real heavy mayn
I'm fuckin' something tonight that's on everything
Fellas who beat bodies with me
Kidnappers and stick-up kids, they all poli' with me
Pop bottles with me, button-up shirts and throwbacks
Old cats only roll when I'm in the city
And the dance floor it's disgustin'
Move your waistline to the basic percussion
I'm that, cool laid-back don who won't say nuttin'
And laugh when a nigga start frontin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nas]
Rock Tims, rock Chucks, rock Bapes
Her light eyes, pretty lips, fly face
First you said you would spread for me in an instant
See me with the next chick, now you act different
Power of the stick shift, now I embarrass her
Play your position, you way outta character
Do the knowledge, graduated hood college with honors
Pay homage to Nas, Dickies and Converse
On the eyes shades in the nighttime regardless
The army's so thick you can't harm us

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Nas]
Where we met, I had to give her mad respect
She was with her man, he took a drag from her cigarette
He told her he'll be back, he jumped in the meter cab
Gestured to her cell to tell her where to meet him at
Now she was mad, and I was looking for my car
She had some plastic bags, coming from the supermarket
Cooking for his ass, how she gone get to the projects?
She aint got no cash, and she strugglin' while walkin'
So I drive past, yo I say "I aint no stalker wit yo big 'ole ass
Heres my help Im tryna offer, I give you a lift"
Who woulda knew it turn to this? now we in the mix
Baby moved up in my crib and she left her ex
Damn we speedin'

[Refrain: Leroy Hutson]
Now girl, you mean the world to me
Now girl, you mean the world to me

[Chorus: Nas]
Im a king, you're a queen
His and hers sinks and the diamond rings
You dont have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when Im in, Im in
Im a king, you're a queen
His and hers sinks and the diamond rings
You dont have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when Im in, Im in
Im a king, you're a queen
His and hers sinks and the diamond rings
You dont have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when Im in, Im in

[Verse 2: Nas]
Baby girl had a son
He was three, yeah I took him in
Now she call him little me, I even look like him
Nah, I mean he look like me, a couple shades darker
She be calling him Blackie, thats 'cause his real father jet black
So she treat him like its a setback
I dont respect that
Now his pops calling collect at the new crib on the new number
Now how he get that?
See, now I knew we was a mismatch
Im laid back, you too used to getting pimp smacked
I see where I went wrong at
I just tried to bring out the queen in you
But when you make a girl leave her man
You never really know where she stand
How you know she really yours?
Somebody could do the same to you
(Same to you, same to you)

[Outro: Leroy Hutson]
Ohh-oh
Ohh-ohh-oh, oh
Oh
Ohh-oh
Ohh-ohh-oh, oh



[Intro: Nas]
Uh, it's real, it's real, it's real
Uh, uh, owe me back, uh shorty
Shorty, what up, huh?
Come on

[Chorus: Ginuwine & (Nas)]
Shorty, say what's your price (uh huh)
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice (uh, uh)
Now let's say you owe me something
(Yeah, owe me back like you owe your tax
Owe me back like forty acres to Blacks
Pay me back when you shake it like that girl)
Shorty, say what's your price (uh huh)
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice (uh, uh)
Now let's say you owe, owe, owe
(Yeah, owe me back like you owe your rent
Owe me back like its money I spent
Pay me back when you shake it again)

[Verse 1: Nas]
The don, all the time, with all the shine
You small time, I ball with mine
Links, minks, Bentley Azure with mine
My jams bump out to the borderline
UK hot with it, blew spots with it
Every continent love when I spit it
Corners to blocks, even the cops feel it
Brothers on lockdown on their cot feel it
It's real in the field, the Last Mohican
Who survived in the streets and did something decent
Now I got plans to buy the whole hood
Legit now, I ain't gotta lie to no judge
I make hits now, money I flip now
Hood fella every honey wanna kiss now
I lit up my neck, pinkie, and wrist now
So girls everywhere, this is how we get down

[Chorus: Ginuwine & (Nas)]
Shorty, say what's your price (uh huh)
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice

Now let's say you owe, owe, owe
(Yeah, owe me back like you owe your rent
Owe me back like its money I spent
Pay me back when you shake it again)

[Verse 2: Nas]
Play to win, girls in the club moving
I get 'em real hot, my songs seduce 'em
I flow, I'm so mysterious
Nas, and Nasty's the alias
Everything platinum I glow
Cadillac trucks pulling up to the do'
On top out the car, lounge at the bar
We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are
Feel like a million dollars, feel me holla
To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas
Thugs in renta's, to the playas and ballers
Sexy mamas, fly ladies looking proper
Look good enough to be taken shopping
Earrings, bracelets, now you rocking
Your body's so nice that I give you this option
Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping

[Chorus: Ginuwine & (Nas)]
Shorty, say what's your price (uh huh)
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice (yeah)
Now let's say you owe me something

Now let's say you owe, owe, owe
(Yeah, owe me back like you owe your rent
Owe me back like its money I spent
Pay me back when you shake it again)

[Bridge: Ginuwine]
I put the shackles on your feet (you owe me)
I think you owe me some (you owe me)
The shackles on your feet (you owe Nas)
I think you owe me some (you owe Ginuwine)
(You owe Timbaland, you owe me)

[Verse 3: Nas]
Lock you down baby, you know what you owe me
Mack like Goldie, it's the same story
Let you hold something, you spending it right
Know where you gon' be by the end of the night
Make it bounce, shake it, move it around
Wiggle it a little bit, throw it to the south
Fantasizing me inside and you riding
Throw it like a stallion, you wearing my medallion

[Outro: Ginuwine]
Shorty, say what's your price
(Say what's your price, baby)
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe me something (oh)
(You owe me something, oh yeah)

[Produced by Large Professor]

[Verse 1]
Uh uh, yo
They plan was to knock me out the top of the game
But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flame
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Nas  too real, Nas  true king
It's however you feel, go 'head, you swing
Your arms too short to box with God
I don't kill soloists, only kill squads
Fame went to they head, so now it's "Fuck Nas"
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys
I seen it coming
Soon as I popped my first bottle
I spotted my enemies tryna do what I do
Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changing on the world since "... Barbeque"
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said
If I, ever make a record, I take a cheque
And put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since the project bench with crack in my sock, asleep
I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna learn the traps of the streets
But look at me now

[Chorus: Sugar Man sample]
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man

[Verse 2]
Now wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
Was suicidal, high, smoking so much lye
I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings in Ghana stay
So I could get old, my flesh rot away
But that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurting me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
.45 in my waist, staring at my reflection
In the mirror, sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion
When everything around me got cloudy
The chair became a king's throne, my destiny found me
It was clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to
And God, I'm so thankful

[Chorus: Sugar Man sample]
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man



[Hook x2]
Your mouth got you in it your ass cant get you out
Next time hold your tongue, you wouldnt have to hold your gun
Know when you don't want war with no one
When the ... niggas after you where you gonna run
You mouth got in it your ass cant get you out
Next time hold your tounge, you wouldnt have to hold your gun
Know when you don't want it with no one
... niggas now are after you and here they come

[Verse 1]
This nigga thinkin that everybody puss til he got his shit push
Lot of shit poppin, got him all swiss cheesed up
He fell to his knees and wished he never released words from outta his mouth bout the next man's Gs
Telling me that he was heavenly involved to rob
Any nigga who scared to murder who had cash
Didn't deserve the convertible cars, sipping bourbon at bars
He feel if they ain't real he should get stuck, him and his peoples
You must be sniffing that diesel
Cause if that nigga knew you was scheming he would just leave you in pieces
Plus he's a friend of ours, we got our Benz's that power
Motor cars hung on the wire, left summers puff party
Plus you dont get enough really never meant ..laugh and threat
.. That they wouldnt budge they play the ..

[Hook (little different)]
Your mouth got you in it your ass cant get you out
Next time hold your tongue, you wouldnt have to hold your gun

Next time hold your tounge, you wouldnt have to hold your gun
Know when you don't want war with no one
... niggas now are after you and here they come

[Verse 2]
These niggas live after death before ...
I got you we smoke the same weed, same cars we drive
Knew two of these dudes got into murder shit just last year
I start fuck with them thinking make me lose my career
We still touch though its just dough
I make some songs that ... on they dirty money just smell wrong
But I don't knock you because we come from the same upbringing
I came up slinging, the same way they came up slinging
One thing I learn though, still judge niggas by it
Say alot about men who contend but can't be quiet
The school from which I learn is the street of old
Fuck fools they talk to worm in six feet hole
Be telling niggas what I'm eatin, what Im holding, its sickening
Don't be conerned with what I'm eating, cause what I eat you ain't shittin
These niggas that start beef, they talk like bitches
And I'm the type to give you ...
Yo, black stocking cap on my face pulled down
From behind, all you hear is the gun cock back sound
And now I put it in yo mouth, fuck you were sayin?
Suck on this you trip, try to duck and imma spray ya

[Hook (little different)]
Your mouth got you in it your ass cant get you out
Next time hold your tongue, you wouldnt have to hold your gun
Know when you don't want beef with no one
When the ... niggas after you where you gonna run
You mouth got you in it your ass cant get you out
Next time hold your tounge, you wouldnt have to hold your gun
Know when you don't want war with no one
... niggas now are after you and here they come

[Verse 3]
You make promises that you can keep full of deceit
Street face swallow pride ...talk to you money shit
You wana run with it .. talk about shit
You ain't get none of it
You whisper got bitch unless is for the real
Always ..tryin' to ..cant remember I said ..fire on you ..
If .. run off cause the things gotta
You aint get no wings ..but ends
How ... Im going blow to you I expect to win

[Intro: Nas (Timbaland)]
(What?) Ever been in love? (C'mon)
Yeah.. are you ready? (uhh) For somethin real?
(Say what?) 'Cause it can't be fake
This ain't no game (C'mon)
You gotta be wit me, for real (uh-huh)
'Cause it's real out here (uh-huh)
So make up your mind, 'cause I ain't got no time
Y'know? (C'mon)

[Verse 1: Nas]
I'm the most wanted baby father, save the drama
We toast when I wine and dine ya -- all you need is me
I won't stress you but bless you
Mentally and sexual, we both intellectual
Can't forget how I met you;
You thought I was a boxer Prince Naseem
But I'm the mobster -- Nas from Queens
And when I gotcha - you riding with me
You keep asking, "When do you have time for me?"
I'm never free always on the move, business oriented
Lifestyle expensive, attract women
You wanna search my pockets, and act all wild
Say I hurt your heart - ask how could I smile?
Wanna call back all my numbers - star 6-9 me
Check my car for rubbers, but quit trying
Before you find what you looking for and get to crying
You always saying what you gon' do if you catch me lying

[Chorus: Aaliyah (Nas)]
You won't see me tonight
You won't see me tomorrow
I'll be gone by daylight (doubt that)
And you'll be so full of sorrow (yeah right)
You'll go tell all your friends (that's right)
How you called and I follow (they know it)
But you won't see me tonight (you don't believe that)
No you won't see me tomorrow

[Verse 2: Nas]
Caramel kisses of Jezebel's sister
I feel no guilt when I twist ya
Turn the other cheek when I see the next freak witcha
You got your name on his lease, copy his keys
That's your lil' spot where you rest your wig piece
Go 'head and live baby, I know you his lady
You page me, when you got the day free
But I be out with my peeps in them system Jeeps
You wanna lay up in the sheets of presidential suites
Like I'll massage you while you massage me, mami
But can you hang with a young man who's doing his thang?
Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up
Timberland boots for girls, with the tree stump
Baggy sweatsuits, mystery what's underneath them
They for my eyes only, you call me when you lonely
But I like to make the baddest girls wait, I got G baby

[Interlude: Aaliyah and Nas]
Call you on a Monday
I'll call you back baby
Call you on a Tuesday
My cell is off baby
Call you on a Wednesday
I'm out of town baby
You won't be back 'til Thursday
I'll page you back baby
Call you on a Monday
I'll call you back baby
Call you on a Tuesday
My cell is off baby
Call you on a Wednesday
I'm out of town baby
You won't be back 'til Thursday
I'll page you back baby

[Chorus: Aaliyah (Nas)]
You won't see me tonight
You won't see me tomorrow
I'll be gone by daylight (doubt that)
And you'll be so full of sorrow (yeah right)
You'll go tell all your friends (that's right)
How you called and I follow (they know it)
But you won't see me tonight (you don't believe that)
No you won't see me tomorrow

[Verse 3: Nas]
Thinking of me, you getting the chills
Like a rush through your body when you think how it feels
Give me a call and my voice give you butterflies in your tummy
Tell your friends you in love with Nas, not his money
And I'll prove I'm a man of my word - handed you furs
Iceberg, everything on this planet Earth a woman desires
You make a good wife to most men
I know I got you open
But -- you just my close friend
Get it baby

[Chorus: Aaliyah (Nas)]
You won't see me tonight
You won't see me tomorrow
I'll be gone by daylight (doubt that)
And you'll be so full of sorrow (yeah right)
You'll go tell all your friends (that's right)
How you called and I follow (they know it)
But you won't see me tonight (you don't believe that)
No you won't see me tomorrow

[Bridge: Nas (Aaliyah)]
The God, the God, the God, Nasir (you won't see me tonight)
The Queen, The Queen, The Queen, Aaliyah (you won't see me tomorrow)
Nah nah (I'll be gone by daylight)
(And you'll be so full of sorrow)
Uhh uhh (you'll go tell all your friends)
Tell your friends (how you called and I followed)
How you followed me (but you won't see me tonight)
Not tonight baby (no, you won't see me tomorrow)
C'mon, c'mon c'mon
Tomorrow, what
Daylight, ghost

[Outro: Timbaland (Aaliyah)]
Say what, say what
Yo (You won't see me tonight)
You won't see Timbaland tonight baby
Ohhh, or Nas Esco', check it
Let it ride
Let it ride

[Intro: Nas]
Yeah, Harlem, Bronx, Brooklyn

[Verse 1: Nas]
Let's make a bet, I know the reason you ain't make it yet
Your stage was set, but you ain't see the tedious ingredients
That go inside of a rider, you hiding from problems and
You never knew how to make dollars
You couldn't make orders at a drive-through McDonald's
I was fly at the Apollo with Black Jason, '89 with a bottle
Niggas jealous of Jason, dark green seven forty, no tint
Rollie on wrist, gleaming, he rock the baldy
Used to ride with him to Brooklyn, Lewis and Halsey
Cop chocolate Thai, Vernon style and burn it down
My nigga Hype in the federal joint, verdict out
Twenty years getting money in the Dirty South
That's alleged, you see my nigga's a stand up dude
So I'm yelling, "Free my nigga!"
My nephew godfather Malik, he jammed up too
For what his hands usually call for, but he ain't do it

[Chorus: Victoria Mont]
Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am
'Cause where I'm from
Man, what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been and what I do
No matter how you try you never can
'Cause where I'm from
And what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been, where I been

[Verse 2: Nas]
You ever been on the other end of a robber's revolver?
Not me, call me Lucky Nas Castellana
Or been shot in the medulla oblongata
And survived and praise God with a bullet I never collided
Some did and they lived, I salute the Gods
Mot spilling, splashed by mistake on my Timb boots for y'all
N.Y. nigga, Adidas, jogging suit
Shell toes, slim, fly nigga
Hudson River, rent a boat, t-shirt with a dinner coat
A vintage Fila like I'm the ghost of Domencio
On any day getting throat in a tinted vehicle
Like a old BK gangsta, but I'm the CEO
Of Nasty Nas Enterprises, mastermind, made men
My success symbolizes loyalty, great friends
Dedication, hard work, routine builds character
In a world full of snakes, rats and scavengers
Never make choices out of desperation, I think through it
Break through walls like Pink Floyd
And drink fluids, of all kind of alcohol, y'all
Vineyards in France, yachts out in Cannes

[Chorus: Victoria Mont]
Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am
'Cause where I'm from
Man, what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been and what I do
No matter how you try you never can
'Cause where I'm from
And what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been, where I been

[Verse 3: Nas]
Now holla at a millionaire
Rollie, Hublot and Audemar, deciding which one to wear
Who to screw, what to drive
550 with the cream guts inside
Or the Super Sport Range truck is fly
Diamond ring on my knuckles, like fire, bitch
Gats on us, I don't really trust these guys
Spend a couple bucks a night on bottles on cuties
If she beautiful, the lustful type, I'll hit it and bust inside
Fuck it, I'ma die one day
They gon' probably make that day a holiday
Until then, let's go on a shopping spree
Speaking for my real niggas
Only OGs, certified who kill niggas
When put in that seat, but tonight we on chill, nigga
Chill mode, spill more Spades
Listen to Yeezy and Hov, some Rozay
It's like we always on the grind with no brakes
So tonight we gon' act like we on vacation with this on rotation

[Chorus: Victoria Mont (Nas)]
Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am (word)
'Cause where I'm from (yeah)
Man, what I see you wouldn't understand
Where I been and what I do
(Y'all wouldn't understand, huh)
No matter how you try you never can
(You wouldn't last a day in my shoes, homie)
'Cause where I'm from (yeah)
And what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been, where I been

[Outro: Nas]
True B nigga, yeah, uhh
For my hood niggas, yeah, yeah
To my man Eric B, what up, yeah
The whole city, I see you
To my man Big Slate in the Fed joint
My man Spunk, free my niggas
All my niggas, yeah
Club Vernon, I see you, I see you, yeah
And Baltum, I see you



[Intro: Nas (Wiz)]
Braveheart for life
Zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out
Uhh, Salaam Remi!
Yeah, zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out, what, yeah
Zo-zo-zo zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out
(I want y'all to blast on these niggas, man)
Zo-zo-zo zone out
Zo-zo-zo zone out

[Verse 1: Jungle]
Tuck in your chain put your watch in your pocket
Here come the Braveheart straight out the projects
We live the life where the blood spills
Same thing that get you cash nigga, get you killed
Warnin', Jungle always keep a gun on him
Pull out, {*shooting sound*}, forehead yawning
Sloppy, droppin' you birds
Close range so my bullets don't swerve, curve
No bullshit, back in ya head, find me
Call Earl, death is the ways of the world
Y'all made criminals tryin' to wild out there sold crack
Bust guns at Bow Wow's age
Fightin' in jail, lookin' for heaven, livin' in hell
Fuckin 'em hoes, boilin' coke since I was 12
Way too foul walk around all the time
With a gray MAC-10 and a pocket full o' dimes

[Verse 2: Wiz]
Braveheart to the graveyard, let's go niggas
Scared straight, but FUCK them hoes
Keep it, dead serious
Believe it don't believe us, until you see me creepin'
Now you sleep with them fishes
G-W-I-Z, so delicious
To all them ghetto and sober bitches in 'burban districts
I'm movin on passin' chumps, and very thoroughly promoted by God's Son
And this is the military turn it up
My Uzi weighs a ton. a ton, your son less thump nah
Heat talk feet walk you run uh
Rat ta-tat, Hear them shots come
Drop son, pull out
You better send 'em back son, or feel that casket
The peeps be like one (one)
I'm movin on passin' chumps, and very thoroughly promoted by God's Son

[Verse 3: Nas]
G-O-D S-O-N
I S-O-O-T-H-E a female's estrogen
With my testosterone, male hormone
Enough for a giant's body, science S-C-I-E-N-C-E
Don't tempt me, EMS against you, me I'm just, invincible
Like Mike Jack said
For me and Al Sharpton won't be Broke in Harlem
That's dead, who made this style, Solo or X
Are you UTFO's Doctor or Moe Dee
Whoever, I freaked it yes, so meet ya death
I never wear Esco, I got a New Line comin' like cinemas
Remember the, original, y'all still tryin' to show niggas ya rich
Town house niggas
I'm six cribs deep, six bank accounts in six countries
Na I'm lyin', who gives a fuck that's so tired
While pictures of Bravehearts just livin' it up
A million of us, each nigga inchin' to bust
You got a house in Virginia, the only way you sicker than us
Gettin' bagged with .22's now you's a ridiculous fuck
No need for the gun play, it's okay, 'cause you dyin' anyway

[Verse 4: Jungle]
Yo, this is for them high school drop outs
Niggas who copped out
If you prefer shots over knockouts
Sniffin' coke, smokin' weed
Sellin' crack, sellin' smack
You thuggin' it, you ain't turn it back
Bravehearts gettin' money ruthless 'till the world end
Gettin' high with my enemy's girlfriend
I used to have a bike on a bench
Now I got the Jeep on this trip
Coke in the pot, heat on my hip

[Verse 5: Wiz]
Nigga don't stop blazin' 'cause ya target's movin'
Shoot 'til the gun's empty stupid, Queens
Niggas so ruthless, really excuses is
Useless to these swift executioners
And that's Queensbridge nigga, all day
Pump packs o' crack, smoke purple haze
Runnin' from D's quickly knockout rookies
G Wiz you know what I'm all about
To all my real niggas

[Chorus]
Zo-zo-zo zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out
Zo-zo-zo zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out
Zo-zo-zo zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out
Zo-zo-zo zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out
