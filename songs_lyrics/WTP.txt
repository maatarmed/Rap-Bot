[Intro]
Yeah! Oh! Get up (Where my trash at?)
I said, get up
You know what happens when I'm around, man
Woo! Let's go
Better watch out now 'cause here we come
And we aint stoppin' until we see the morning sun
So give us room to do our thing
'Cause we aint come to hurt no one
So everybody come and get up on the floor now
And grab someone

[Verse 1]
Man, first of all; Im a boss
I just want to get that across
Man, even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like its a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows, spray-painted doors
With the flames on em, Michigan plates, and my name's on em
Baby, Shadys here, come and get him if you dames want him
But he aint stupid so quit tryna run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryna put your claims on him?
'Cause you wont do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
Theres a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now can I get that lap dance?
Shes got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan, we call em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps down
And show this hussy whos the man now get amped, dance

[Chorus]
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party (white trash party)
So lets have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it aint no one but us trash
You dont know, you better ask somebody
'Cause were having a white trash party (white trash party)

[Verse 2]
Pull a fifth of Bacardi from out of my underwear
And walk around the party without a care
Like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Living Dead
And tomorrow I'll probably still be too high to get out of bed
'Til I feel like I been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
I'm mixin' Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot the gift like Im hollering "Die Santa"
Missed the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders
So quit tryna play the wall like you Paul
And get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin'
Makin' it rain for the ladies in the minis
But Im not throwin' ones, fives, tens, or even twenties
Im throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Dennys
From the North, East, and West
But when it comes to them trailers in them South parks
Muffle it, 'cause, homie, that hoods tighter than Kennys
So, ladies, if your belly buttons not an innie, then Im outtie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy
Come on

[Chorus]
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party (white trash party)
So lets have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it aint no one but us trash
You dont know, you better ask somebody
'Cause were having a white trash party (white trash party)

[Bridge]
Now whether youre black, white, or purple
If youre misunderstood
But you dont give a fuck, you aint doin' shit that you should
Long as you know youre up to evil and youre no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep your hood

[Verse 3]
Now honey, dont let them pricks trip
We should make a quick dip
And go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot
'Cause, girlI got a sick whip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift
And make a five-seater, Ill be damned if I feed a chick
It aint like me to split a piece of dry pita
I be the S-L-to-the-I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y
And I dont need a tank top to be a wife beater
Ill rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
Ill tell you now, Im so raw, I still need to unthaw
You feel me, y'all? I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby, a body like thats against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now get up

[Chorus]
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party
So lets have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it aint no one but us trash
You dont know, you better ask somebody
'Cause were having a white trash party (white trash party)
