Lyrics :
[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, play that shit
What the fuck you doing Stretch
Gotta stretch your neck
You better protect it
Imma Inspectah Deck
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ho, ho

[Verse 1]
Paul Wheres my words at
Yo see Slim Shady yo, where the birds at
Being flipped the middle ones
Rappers get these little ones in they mouth
These little nuts, yeah
Shit, I dont care I aint afraid to admit it
I got a little dick yeah, but so do you
You scared to admit it
You wont spit it on this mother friggen mic
Cause I will strike and smack your ass like a friggen fag
And I dont care if you get offended
I never pretended to rock this microphone beef
You wanna start it now well end it
Cause when I slip in the zone up on this microphone
People want me to do a written rap but fuck that go home
I dont really give a damn Ill kick right off of the top
And everything that I drop always gonna remain hot
Let on the spot, Slim, I mean woops, Grim its when im dim
Yo, Im in affect mode
Rappers get they neck sewed
Get they whole threshold fucked up
Get they damn fleshed sewed
Ha, ha
I busted, I kill it, I crush it, I do it, the fluid, I spill it, Im ill wit
These motherfucking rhymes that I be coming with and running with and kick you in yo motherfucking stomach with bitch
Cause you dont want none of it
Rappers always try but they always die
And rappers always look to me and tried to lie
(Arf, Arf)
Yo, where my dogs at
Yo (err, ribbit) where my frogs at
In the house, It really doesnt matter cause I still turn it out
When I step on this mic, smacking your spouse
Ha, Ha
The illest MC to come off the top
When I get this drum off
Yo Strech give me a break, let me catch my friggen breath
And till` the death, bust rhymes till` theres none left
Im wanted for theft and robbery
And probably smack a bitch up in the lobby G
Cause she dont want none of me
Im the illest MC to ever hold a cordless on the planet earth and youll see
That Im from the friggen D
Yall dont get my point Im from Detroit
Smoke your fake ass like a joint
Thats the first simplest rhyme I ever said in my life
But, at the end of the night Ill still be fucking your wife
Shit, I really dont care your style needs to switch
Cause you aint rich, thats why you aint rich
Remain underground, cant come off the top
You cant drop rhymes nonstop like this
I might twist my friggen dick up in your ear
Rappers always wanna stand clear
Im a motherfucking landmine
Yall dont understand mine
Im Slim Shady showing out like my tan line
Ha, ha
The illest MC to rhyme
Every time the illest MC of our time
I rhyme time and time twice but Im nice
With this mic device I slice right through your Adams apple
I had a Snapple and a motherfriggen syringe
Up in the bathroom I shouldnt have but yo I boinked
To any MC up in this shit who want some
To any MC who wanna step up and get some
Get done, fuck competition
Let me catch my breath one more time
Yo, Im on a mission
To stomp any MC comp I just trunked
And swamp is this truamp a word?, no its not
Yo, but here I go with this lyrical, lyricols, spiritual flows, that I flow so hysterical
Driving MCs crazy, Slim Shady, up in your motherfucking radio baby
