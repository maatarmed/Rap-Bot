Lyrics :
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo, weed lacer, 97 burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary, had to ditch the Mercury Tracer
Im on some loced shit, some fed up with the bein broke shit
Im not to joke with, bitch I dont sell crack, I smoke it
Havin' a coke fit, goin' through withdrawals daily
Shoot up with mescaline in front of my baby daughter Hailie
My brains dusted, Im disgusted at all my habits
Too many aspirin tablets, empty medicine cabinets
Losin' battles to wack rappers cause Im always too blunted
Walkin up in the cypher smokin, talkin about Who want it?
Thug and a crook; every drug in the book Ive done it
My 9s at your brain, is that you chain? run it
Crews die from an overdosage of excessive flavor
Aggressive nature got me stickin you for your Progressive pager
Spectacular, battle rap manufacturer
Stole your mommas Acura, wrecked it, and sold it back to her
Boostin Nike jackets, escaped from psychiatrics
Told the nurse to save my bed for me, I might be back trick
So barricade your entrance, put up some extra fences
A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses
Chasin dips  take em on long vacation trips
Kidnappin em and trappin em in abusive relationships
Mess up your face and lips, slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Gut you with that razor that I use to shave my nuts with
Mama, dont you cry, your son is too far gone
Im so high, I dont even know what label Im on
Im messed up, I feel just like an overworked plumber
Im sick of the crap, whats Jack Kevorkians phone number?
