Title : Youre Never Over
Artist : Eminem
Lyrics :
[Chorus]
The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, Im growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but youre never over

[Verse 1]
If Proof could see me now, I know hed be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, theres somethin' in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, itll be them doors on Dre's Phantom, believe me, clowns
That means "suicide," homie
Youll never throw me off of this course, blow me!
Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, Im not just talkin' awards, homie
And the ball's in my court and its lonely
On top of the world, when youre the only one
With the balls in your shorts
To leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse
'Member that when they get to doggin' you boy, homie
So yall can just get to bloggin' about bologna
Im not gonna stop, the saga continues, no stoppin' the force, Obi
Im moppin' the floors with 'em
I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on droppin' the torch
And it wont be long 'til this sport is O-V-E-R
Just Blaze and me, we are knockin' on doors
And no, we aint pumpkins on Halloween
But well show up on your porch, so be
Careful what you say, there aint no punks over here, so follow me
Through the fog like Im S-N-double-O-P
Let me guide you through the smoke, G
If only I wasnt travelin' down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I dont think you understand how much you meant to me

[Chorus]
The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, Im growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but youre never over

[Bridge]
And it dont stop, oh-oooh
And it dont quit, oh-oooh
And it dont stop, oh-oooh
And it dont quit, oh-oooh
And I miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
And homie, Ill never forget you, nooo

[Verse 2]
For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick itll blow up the mic, itll put the "dyna" in mite
Yeah, itll make the dopest MC
Wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, itll jump off the page and spit itself
Guess that the best thing I can do
Right now, Doody, for you is to rep
So Im gonna fuck 'til I die, yeah, I'ma do it to death
And instead of mournin' your death
Id rather celebrate your life, elevate to new heights
Step on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need two mics
'Cause the way that Im feelin' tonight
Everything I can just do right
Theres nothin' that I can do wrong
Im too strong and Im just too hype
Just finish the rhyme and I bust it
Excuse the corny metaphor, but theyll never ketchup
To all this energy that Ive mustard
So God, just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage
Ive been patiently watchin' this game
Pacin' these hallways, you had faith in me always
Proof, you knew Id come out of this slump
Rise from these ashes, come right back on their asses
And go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'ma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em, homes
Ima own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below 'em
Homie, I know Im never gonna be the same without you
I never woulda came in this game, Im goin' insane without you
Matter fact, it was just the other night
Had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me, "Naw, Doody, youre not!"
Layin' on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it soon as you said, "think of Hailie", I knew
There wasnt no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies
And Proof, not many are lucky enough
To have a guardian angel like you, Lord, Im so thankful
Please dont think that I dont feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need
For one more day to get through
So, homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you, Doody

[Chorus]
The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, Im growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but youre never over

[Bridge]
And it dont stop, oh-oooh
And it dont quit, oh-oooh
And it dont stop, oh-oooh
And it dont quit, oh-oooh
And I miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
I just miss you, oh-oooh
And homie, Ill never forget you, nooo
