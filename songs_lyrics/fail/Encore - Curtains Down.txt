Title : Encore - Curtains Down
Artist : Eminem
Lyrics :
[Intro: 50 Cent & Eminem]
Sh-sh-sh, Shady! Aftermath! Haha!
G-G-G-G, G-Unit! Haha!

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Cause we came here to set this party off right
Lets bounce tonight
And if they dont let us in through the front
Well come through the side
Cause I dont ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Introduction: Eminem]
Get your ass up for the doctor, one more time
Get your ass up for the doctor, come on now
Here we go, cliff hanger, its another club banger
Got ya hangin on the edge of your seat, get on down

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Times up, games over, you lose, Iwin
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Oh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look whos got you goin crazy again
Im a trend, I set one every time Im in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you something that we already had
But once youre gone, you dont come back
Too bad, youre off the map now, radar cant even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin and moanin, wining and bitchin
Sit and observe, listen, youll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
Worldwide, were on the charts with a bullet and still climbin

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Cause we came here to set this party off right
Lets bounce tonight
And if they dont let us in through the front
Well come through the side
Cause I dont ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Introduction: Eminem, Dr. Dre & 50Cent]
When Dr. Dre says crunk, you will get it crunk
Get it crunk! Crunk! Crunk! Crunk!
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I dont gotta promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin off the hinges
We aint showin off, we just going off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?!)
We gon have this motherfucker hoppin in a second (Bump, bump!)
Thats why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasnt for rap to bridge the gap may be raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
To pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game
Thats why we came to

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Cause we came here to set this party off right
Lets bounce tonight
And if they dont let us in through the front
Well come through the side
Cause I dont ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Introduction: Eminem]
50 Cent, come on!

[Verse 3: 50 Cent, Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
Its no secret, everybody know
When Dres involved, theres plenty of money involved
And plenty honeys involved and sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, everyday is just another party
From the valleys all the way to them 8Mile alleys
Lets rally, hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dres about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, bangin out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazing out your speakers
So never say never cause Shady, Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the
The Doc and Shady, no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence thata

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
We came here to set this party off right
Lets bounce tonight
And if they dont let us in through the front
Well come through the side
Cause I dont ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Outro: Eminem & 50Cent]
Yeah, haha! Still Aftermath, 2006! And dont worry about that Detox album, its comin We gon make Dre do it! Haha! 50 Cent, G-Unit, Obie Trice, D-Twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr.Dre! We aint leaving, lets go, haha! Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming out! Peace!
