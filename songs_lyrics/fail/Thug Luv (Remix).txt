Title : Thug Luv (Remix)
Artist : The Others
Lyrics :
[Intro: 50 Cent]
TE baby, come on, uh-huh Trackmasters uh-huh

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Look we can shop together mama, his and hers
Fifth Ave shit baby, Fendi furs
I ain't tight with the chips girl
I'm down to splurge
If it's ice you like I'll light up your life (Ooh)
VS2 Clarity aight
I play the block I ain't the type to punch a clock
I'm the type to put the pedal to the floor in the drop
I live life in the fast lane
I mix dro with hash
Hustle hard for cash so I can spoil that ass
It's like she loves me, she loves me not
Cause her friends pump her head full of bullshit alot
I gave jewels I imported from Joe's
Chanel bags I bought from boosters
To the hood I introduced her
She feisty, every now and then she wanna fight me
People saying if I get knocked she ain't gon write me
The sick part is all that bullshit excites me

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
A thug's what I want
A thug's what I need
Even though my friends don't seem to see
That he lace me with money
He knows when I want it
And I'm never gonna leave my baby
My thug don't no good, baby

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's like this and like that and like this
Hey yo I'm the illest rapper to hold the cojones
Patrol the corners looking for hookers
To punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Brosco beating James Todd Senior
And smacking his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed I kept the same mind state
Since the third time I failed ninth grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person
Don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend can jump off of a bridge
And if you live do it again
Shit why not, blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out, fuck it
You only live once you might as well die now

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
A thug's what I want
A thug's what I need
Even though my friends don't seem to see
That he lace me with money
He knows when I want it
And I'm never gonna leave my baby
My thug don't no good, baby

[Verse 3: Erick Onassis]
Check it
When I come in the place excitement
Like plain watched took the Jacob and iced it
Blaine E coming through in the purest form
On some Streisand shit when a star is born
I might rock a fake diamond watch for the scene
And rob me end up deaf for no reason
I approach those that wanna cramp my style
When I ask they be like hunh
Like a juvenile crack a smile say a rhyme
That's straight out cold
Strong enough to grab you
With his choke hold
So what ya all want don't dare taunt
Or I leave you in the back of somebody's restaurant, it's murda
Laying flat with the rats and cats
By a cardboard box where the buns be at
One more thing for those that wanna bite my shit
I hope you choke and no one give you the Heimlich, dead
Onassis, Aristotle on the mic
Paint a picture that would out weigh Picasso, yeeeah
Yeah you can't be believing it
You imagining the unity of bossy and shit
No matter the deal, money, money

[Chorus: x2 Destiny's Child]
A thug's what I want
A thug's what I need
Even though my friends don't seem to see
That he lace me with money
He knows when I want it
And I'm never gonna leave my baby
My thug don't no good, baby

[Bridge Fader: Beyonce]
A thug is what I want
And a thug is what I need
And my friends don't understand
How my baby laces me
A thug is what I want
And a thug is what I need
And my friends don't understand
And I think its jealousy
