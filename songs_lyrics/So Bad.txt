Title : So Bad
Artist : Eminem
Lyrics :
[Intro]
Yeah, haha, you feel that, baby?
Yeah, I feel it too, damn
You know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together
You see, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was, am I?

[Verse 1]
Im the American Dream
Im the definiton of white trash ballin
Im right back on 'em with a *err-chick-err, chicka-chick*
I cant call it, same shit, different toilet
Oh, you got a nice ass, darling
Cant wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin? You take me for a friend?
Let me tell you the whole story of Shadys origin
Youll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again
Now, it all started with my father
I mustve got my pimpin' genes from him
The way he left my momma
Im a rolling stone, just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage with me, baby, Ill make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as
Me, Im as calm as the breeze
Im the bees knees, his legs, and his arms
I'm a superstar, girl, Im ready for you, mama
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas?

[Chorus]
I'm so bad, Im so good that Im so bad
I guarantee Ill be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad, Im so good that Im so bad
I guarantee Ill be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

[Verse 2]
I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuervo
First Ill kiss your navel, work my way down
Baby, you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find somethin' more stable
I told you I ain't foolin' from the gate
This ain't the first day of April
But thank you for stayin', April
I'ma make you learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phony, little fishy and sissy fake Gs
Skip over the "huggy bear," and all the "kissy face," please
Initiate phase three, missy, now service me
Take another shot of Jger, shakin' so nervously
Take your time, baby, oh, youre the bomb, baby
Oh, youre doing that even better than your mom, lady
I told you why Im Shady, you didn't listen now, did ya?
Relax, woman, you know that Im only kiddin' with ya
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped, but I didn't hit ya
I think youre finally startin' to get the picture, Im just...

[Chorus]
I'm so bad, Im so good that Im so bad
I guarantee Ill be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad, Im so good that Im so bad
I guarantee Ill be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

[Bridge]
Call me dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
Call me dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go
Cause I'm on to the next girl
And the next girl I kind of like, oh

[Verse 3]
I got you caught up in the rapture, make you recapture
The feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad, you're
Sweatin', but if Im what you wanted
Whyd you panic when I grabbed ya?
Girl, don't be so frantic, Im just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of somethin' that's so organic
You cant ignore it, so don't, just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, lets get to camcordin'
Damn, shawty, I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on the napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back
And throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blind that
You couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a line-up
So stop at the store, pick a pint up
Let's get the pineapple Schnapps going, no one will knock
Cause I'ma hang a sign up saying "Don't Disturb"
Shawty, Im so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words?

[Chorus]
I'm so bad, Im so good that Im so bad
I guarantee Ill be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad, Im so good that Im so bad
I guarantee Ill be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

[Bridge]
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go
Cause I am on to the next girl
And the next girl I kind of like, oh

[Chorus]
I'm so bad, Im so good that Im so bad
I guarantee Ill be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad, Im so good that Im so bad
I guarantee Ill be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
