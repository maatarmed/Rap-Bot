Title : Beautiful Pain
Artist : Eminem
Lyrics :
[Intro: Eminem and Sia]
I can feel the heat risin'
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder
Of why we can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, cause

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yesterday was the tornado warning, today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake in its wake to start the
Mourning process, and rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass, uh
Thunderstorm has passed ya, you weathered it
And poked its eye out with the thorn bush that you used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is
Stuffed, so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner faster, more assertive, never looking back
May hit the curb, but every day is a new learning curve as you
Steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve, but you have to
To avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket but you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past standing at inferno and chant

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive, which means you will survive
Although today you may weep cause you're weak
And everything seems so bleak and hopeless, the light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in; that's the only thing keepin'
You from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing and by tomorrow
You may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em
Even after all the shit you been put through, this feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in, but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin', you look down
Cause you're so over 'em you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

[Bridge: Eminem]
As time passes, things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal, but scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow, today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even
Perspire from the heat, exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief it's like watching the walls
Melt in your prison cell, but you've extinguished this livin' hell
Still, a little piece of you dies as you scream

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Bridge: Sia]
I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I have learned from fighting fights that weren't mine
It's not with fists, but with wings that I will fly

[Hook: Sia]
And I'm standin' in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
